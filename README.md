| **[ConsistentDreamer: View-Consistent Meshes Through Balanced Multi-View Gaussian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09278v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved 3D generation, enabling the use of assets generated from an image for embodied AI simulations. However, the one-to-many nature of the image-to-3D problem limits their use due to inconsistent content and quality across views. Previous models optimize a 3D model by sampling views from a view-conditioned diffusion prior, but diffusion models cannot guarantee view consistency. Instead, we present ConsistentDreamer, where we first generate a set of fixed multi-view prior images and sample random views between them with another diffusion model through a score distillation sampling (SDS) loss. Thereby, we limit the discrepancies between the views guided by the SDS loss and ensure a consistent rough shape. In each iteration, we also use our generated multi-view prior images for fine-detail reconstruction. To balance between the rough shape and the fine-detail optimizations, we introduce dynamic task-dependent weights based on homoscedastic uncertainty, updated automatically in each iteration. Additionally, we employ opacity, depth distortion, and normal alignment losses to refine the surface for mesh extraction. Our method ensures better view consistency and visual quality compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> |
| **[POEX: Understanding and Mitigating Policy Executable Jailbreak Attacks against Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16633v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems are rapidly evolving due to the integration of LLMs as planning modules, which transform complex instructions into executable policies. However, LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can generate malicious content. This paper investigates the feasibility and rationale behind applying traditional LLM jailbreak attacks to EAI systems. We aim to answer three questions: (1) Do traditional LLM jailbreak attacks apply to EAI systems? (2) What challenges arise if they do not? and (3) How can we defend against EAI jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first measure existing LLM-based EAI systems using a newly constructed dataset, i.e., the Harmful-RLbench. Our study confirms that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are not directly applicable to EAI systems and identifies two unique challenges. First, the harmful text does not necessarily constitute harmful policies. Second, even if harmful policies can be generated, they are not necessarily executable by the EAI systems, which limits the potential risk. To facilitate a more comprehensive security analysis, we refine and introduce POEX, a novel red teaming framework that optimizes adversarial suffixes to induce harmful yet executable policies against EAI systems. The design of POEX employs adversarial constraints, policy evaluators, and suffix optimization to ensure successful policy execution while evading safety detection inside an EAI system. Experiments on the real-world robotic arm and simulator using Harmful-RLbench demonstrate the efficacy, highlighting severe safety vulnerabilities and high transferability across models. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses, achieving an 85% success rate in mitigating attacks and enhancing safety awareness in EAI systems. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust security measures to ensure the safe deployment of EAI in critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://poex-eai-jailbreak.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[TorchResist: Open-Source Differentiable Resist Simulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06838v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent decades have witnessed remarkable advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), including large language models (LLMs), image and video generative models, and embodied AI systems. These advancements have led to an explosive increase in the demand for computational power, challenging the limits of Moore's Law. Optical lithography, a critical technology in semiconductor manufacturing, faces significant challenges due to its high costs. To address this, various lithography simulators have been developed. However, many of these simulators are limited by their inadequate photoresist modeling capabilities. This paper presents TorchResist, an open-source, differentiable photoresist simulator.TorchResist employs an analytical approach to model the photoresist process, functioning as a white-box system with at most twenty interpretable parameters. Leveraging modern differentiable programming techniques and parallel computing on GPUs, TorchResist enables seamless co-optimization with other tools across multiple related tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that TorchResist achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing solutions. The source code is publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>SPIE ...</summary><p>SPIE Advanced Lithography + Patterning, 2025</p></details> |
| **[BadRobot: Jailbreaking Embodied LLMs in the Physical World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20242v4)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI represents systems where AI is integrated into physical entities. Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[LSceneLLM: Enhancing Large 3D Scene Understanding Using Adaptive Visual Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01292v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on 3D Vision-Language Models (3D-VLMs) is gaining increasing attention, which is crucial for developing embodied AI within 3D scenes, such as visual navigation and embodied question answering. Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[RefDrone: A Challenging Benchmark for Referring Expression Comprehension in Drone Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00392v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drones have become prevalent robotic platforms with diverse applications, showing significant potential in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI). Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) enables drones to locate objects based on natural language expressions, a crucial capability for Embodied AI. Despite advances in REC for ground-level scenes, aerial views introduce unique challenges including varying viewpoints, occlusions and scale variations. To address this gap, we introduce RefDrone, a REC benchmark for drone scenes. RefDrone reveals three key challenges in REC: 1) multi-scale and small-scale target detection; 2) multi-target and no-target samples; 3) complex environment with rich contextual expressions. To efficiently construct this dataset, we develop RDAgent (referring drone annotation framework with multi-agent system), a semi-automated annotation tool for REC tasks. RDAgent ensures high-quality contextual expressions and reduces annotation cost. Furthermore, we propose Number GroundingDINO (NGDINO), a novel method designed to handle multi-target and no-target cases. NGDINO explicitly learns and utilizes the number of objects referred to in the expression. Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art REC methods demonstrate that NGDINO achieves superior performance on both the proposed RefDrone and the existing gRefCOCO datasets. The dataset and code will be publicly at https://github.com/sunzc-sunny/refdrone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Action Learning Requires Supervision in the Presence of Distractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00379v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, latent action learning, pioneered by Latent Action Policies (LAPO), have shown remarkable pre-training efficiency on observation-only data, offering potential for leveraging vast amounts of video available on the web for embodied AI. However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | Preprint.

| **[MINDSTORES: Memory-Informed Neural Decision Synthesis for Task-Oriented Reinforcement in Embodied Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19318v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities as zero-shot planners for embodied agents, their inability to learn from experience and build persistent mental models limits their robustness in complex open-world environments like Minecraft. We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deception in LLMs: Self-Preservation and Autonomous Goals in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16513v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have incorporated planning and reasoning capabilities, enabling models to outline steps before execution and provide transparent reasoning paths. This enhancement has reduced errors in mathematical and logical tasks while improving accuracy. These developments have facilitated LLMs' use as agents that can interact with tools and adapt their responses based on new information. Our study examines DeepSeek R1, a model trained to output reasoning tokens similar to OpenAI's o1. Testing revealed concerning behaviors: the model exhibited deceptive tendencies and demonstrated self-preservation instincts, including attempts of self-replication, despite these traits not being explicitly programmed (or prompted). These findings raise concerns about LLMs potentially masking their true objectives behind a facade of alignment. When integrating such LLMs into robotic systems, the risks become tangible - a physically embodied AI exhibiting deceptive behaviors and self-preservation instincts could pursue its hidden objectives through real-world actions. This highlights the critical need for robust goal specification and safety frameworks before any physical implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected Version - Solved Some Issues with reference compilation by latex</p></details> |
| **[PhysBench: Benchmarking and Enhancing Vision-Language Models for Physical World Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16411v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the physical world is a fundamental challenge in embodied AI, critical for enabling agents to perform complex tasks and operate safely in real-world environments. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 10,002 entries of interleaved video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world -- likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of embedded physical priors. To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4\% improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can help embodied agents such as MOKA. We believe that PhysBench and PhysAgent offer valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between VLMs and physical world understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

| **[From Screens to Scenes: A Survey of Embodied AI in Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07468v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare systems worldwide face persistent challenges in efficiency, accessibility, and personalization. Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development. By providing systematic insights, this work aims to inspire innovation and practical applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent, patient-centered healthcare.</p></details> | 58 pages, 11 figures |

Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[EmbodiedEval: Evaluate Multimodal LLMs as Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11858v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant advancements, providing a promising future for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development. We open-source all evaluation data and simulation framework at https://github.com/thunlp/EmbodiedEval.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenEx: Generating an Explorable World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09624v4)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding, navigating, and exploring the 3D physical real world has long been a central challenge in the development of artificial intelligence. In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. In summary, we demonstrate that GenEx provides a transformative platform for advancing embodied AI in imaginative spaces and brings potential for extending these capabilities to real-world exploration.</p></details> | Website: GenEx.world |
| **[Embodied Agent Interface: Benchmarking LLMs for Embodied Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07166v3)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We aim to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for embodied decision making. While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at NeurIPS 2024 in the Datasets and Benchmarks track.

| **[Embodied Scene Understanding for Vision Language Models via MetaVQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09167v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate significant potential as embodied AI agents for various mobility applications. However, a standardized, closed-loop benchmark for evaluating their spatial reasoning and sequential decision-making capabilities is lacking. To address this, we present MetaVQA: a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess and enhance VLMs' understanding of spatial relationships and scene dynamics through Visual Question Answering (VQA) and closed-loop simulations. MetaVQA leverages Set-of-Mark prompting and top-down view ground-truth annotations from nuScenes and Waymo datasets to automatically generate extensive question-answer pairs based on diverse real-world traffic scenarios, ensuring object-centric and context-rich instructions. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with the MetaVQA dataset significantly improves their spatial reasoning and embodied scene comprehension in safety-critical simulations, evident not only in improved VQA accuracies but also in emerging safety-aware driving maneuvers. In addition, the learning demonstrates strong transferability from simulation to real-world observation. Code and data will be publicly available at https://metadriverse.github.io/metavqa .</p></details> | <details><summary>for t...</summary><p>for the project webpage, see https://metadriverse.github.io/metavqa</p></details> |

However, many sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, demand AI systems capable of extending their intelligence into the physical world, interacting directly with objects, environments, and dynamic conditions. This need has led to the emergence of Physical AI Agents--systems that integrate cognitive reasoning, powered by specialized LLMs, with precise physical actions to perform real-world tasks. This work introduces Physical AI Agents as an evolution of shared principles with Vertical AI Agents, tailored for physical interaction. We propose a modular architecture with three core blocks--perception, cognition, and actuation--offering a scalable framework for diverse industries. Additionally, we present the Physical Retrieval Augmented Generation (Ph-RAG) design pattern, which connects physical intelligence to industry-specific LLMs for real-time decision-making and reporting informed by physical context. Through case studies, we demonstrate how Physical AI Agents and the Ph-RAG framework are transforming industries like autonomous vehicles, warehouse robotics, healthcare, and manufacturing, offering businesses a pathway to integrate embodied AI for operational efficiency and innovation.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |

Detection and Localization of Instruction Errors in Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10700v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is one of the most intuitive yet challenging embodied AI tasks. Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks.

However, tasks such as object search have largely focused on efficient policy learning. In this work, we identify several gaps in current search methods: They largely focus on dated perception models, neglect temporal aggregation, and transfer from ground truth directly to noisy perception at test time, without accounting for the resulting overconfidence in the perceived state. We address the identified problems through calibrated perception probabilities and uncertainty across aggregation and found decisions, thereby adapting the models for sequential tasks. The resulting methods can be directly integrated with pretrained models across a wide family of existing search approaches at no additional training cost. We perform extensive evaluations of aggregation methods across both different semantic perception models and policies, confirming the importance of calibrated uncertainties in both the aggregation and found decisions. We make the code and trained models available at https://semantic-search.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior studies that explored this as long-form video understanding and utilized egocentric video only, we instead propose an LLM-based agent, Embodied VideoAgent, which constructs scene memory from both egocentric video and embodied sensory inputs (e.g. depth and pose sensing). We further introduce a VLM-based approach to automatically update the memory when actions or activities over objects are perceived. Embodied VideoAgent attains significant advantages over counterparts in challenging reasoning and planning tasks in 3D scenes, achieving gains of 4.9% on Ego4D-VQ3D, 5.8% on OpenEQA, and 11.7% on EnvQA. We have also demonstrated its potential in various embodied AI tasks including generating embodied interactions and perception for robot manipulation.

Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p></details> | accepted to AAAI2025 |

Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages with 5 figures and 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Embodied AI-Enhanced Vehicular Networks: An Integrated Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01141v1)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates adaptive transmission strategies in embodied AI-enhanced vehicular networks by integrating large language models (LLMs) for semantic information extraction and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for decision-making. The proposed framework aims to optimize both data transmission efficiency and decision accuracy by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates the Weber-Fechner law, serving as a metric for balancing bandwidth utilization and quality of experience (QoE). Specifically, we employ the large language and vision assistant (LLAVA) model to extract critical semantic information from raw image data captured by embodied AI agents (i.e., vehicles), reducing transmission data size by approximately more than 90\% while retaining essential content for vehicular communication and decision-making. In the dynamic vehicular environment, we employ a generalized advantage estimation-based proximal policy optimization (GAE-PPO) method to stabilize decision-making under uncertainty. Simulation results show that attention maps from LLAVA highlight the model's focus on relevant image regions, enhancing semantic representation accuracy. Additionally, our proposed transmission strategy improves QoE by up to 36\% compared to DDPG and accelerates convergence by reducing required steps by up to 47\% compared to pure PPO. Further analysis indicates that adapting semantic symbol length provides an effective trade-off between transmission quality and bandwidth, achieving up to a 61.4\% improvement in QoE when scaling from 4 to 8 vehicles.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

However, for robot-generated content (RGC), will its image quality be consistent with the Moravec paradox and counter to human common sense? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we first propose an embodied image quality assessment (EIQA) frameworks. We establish assessment metrics for input images based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, we construct an Embodied Preference Database (EPD) containing 5,000 reference and distorted image annotations. The performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is finally verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment.

However, LAE also faces challenges in data collection and processing efficiency, flight control precision, and network performance. The challenges could be solved by realizing an integration of sensing, communications, computation, and control (ISC3) for LAE. In this regard, embodied artificial intelligence (EAI), with its unique perception, planning, and decision-making capabilities, offers a promising solution to realize ISC3. Specifically, this paper investigates an application of EAI into ISC3 to support LAE, exploring potential research focuses, solutions, and case study. We begin by outlining rationales and benefits of introducing EAI into LAE, followed by reviewing research directions and solutions for EAI in ISC3. We then propose a framework of an EAI-enabled ISC3 for LAE. The framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a case study of express delivery utilizing an EAI-enabled UAV. Finally, we discuss several future research directions for advancing EAI-enabled LAE.</p></details> |  |

While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve-1), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods. We will release our code and demos on the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/mr-steve.</p></details> |  |

Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments. This project represents a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art in GameFi, offering insights and methodologies that can be applied throughout the gaming industry.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

While existing methods can synthesize realistic human motions in 3D scenes and generate plausible human-object interactions, they heavily rely on datasets containing paired 3D scene and motion capture data, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect across diverse environments and interactions. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis by integrating video generation and neural human rendering. Our key insight is to leverage the rich motion priors learned by state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/</p></details> |

Despite significant progress in handling complex environments using deep reinforcement learning, current PGN methods are designed for single-robot systems, limiting their generalizability to multi-robot scenarios with diverse platforms. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a knowledge transfer framework for PGN, allowing a teacher robot to transfer its learned navigation model to student robots, including those with unknown or black-box platforms. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework that transfers first-person-view (FPV) representations (view images, turning/forward actions) to universally applicable third-person-view (TPV) representations (local maps, subgoals). The state is redefined as reconstructed local maps using SLAM, while actions are mapped to subgoals on a predefined grid. To enhance training efficiency, we propose a sampling-efficient KD approach that aligns training episodes via a noise-robust local map descriptor (LMD). Although validated on 2D wheeled robots, this method can be extended to 3D action spaces, such as drones. Experiments conducted in Habitat-Sim demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, requiring minimal implementation effort. This study highlights the potential for scalable and cross-platform PGN solutions, expanding the applicability of embodied AI systems in multi-robot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper: 5 pages with 2 figures</p></details> |

However, as frontier tasks in robotics get more advanced, they require faster simulation speed, more intricate test environments, and larger demonstration datasets. To this end, we present MS-HAB, a holistic benchmark for low-level manipulation and in-home object rearrangement. First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of previous magical grasp implementations at similar GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the lack of comprehensive 3D benchmarks, the capabilities of 3D models in real-world scenes, particularly those that are challenging with subtly distinguished objects, remain insufficiently investigated. To facilitate a more thorough evaluation of 3D models' capabilities, we propose a scheme, ObjVariantEnsemble, to systematically introduce more scenes with specified object classes, colors, shapes, quantities, and spatial relationships to meet model evaluation needs. More importantly, we intentionally construct scenes with similar objects to a certain degree and design an LLM-VLM-cooperated annotator to capture key distinctions as annotations. The resultant benchmark can better challenge 3D models, reveal their shortcomings in understanding, and potentially aid in the further development of 3D models.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |

The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</p></details> |  |
| **[ON as ALC: Active Loop Closing Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11523v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In simultaneous localization and mapping, active loop closing (ALC) is an active vision problem that aims to visually guide a robot to maximize the chances of revisiting previously visited points, thereby resetting the drift errors accumulated in the incrementally built map during travel. However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, current robots struggle to fully and accurately interpret human intentions from voice commands alone. Traditional gripper and suction systems often fail to interact naturally with humans, lack advanced manipulation capabilities, and are not adaptable to diverse tasks, especially in unstructured environments. This paper introduces the Embodied Dexterous Grasping System (EDGS), designed to tackle object grasping in cluttered environments for human-robot interaction. We propose a novel approach to semantic-object alignment using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that fuses voice commands and visual information, significantly enhancing the alignment of multi-dimensional attributes of target objects in complex scenarios. Inspired by human hand-object interactions, we develop a robust, precise, and efficient grasping strategy, incorporating principles like the thumb-object axis, multi-finger wrapping, and fingertip interaction with an object's contact mechanics. We also design experiments to assess Referring Expression Representation Enrichment (RERE) in referring expression segmentation, demonstrating that our system accurately detects and matches referring expressions. Extensive experiments confirm that EDGS can effectively handle complex grasping tasks, achieving stability and high success rates, highlighting its potential for further development in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Code and data are available at https://github.com/wz0919/VLN-SRDF</p></details> |

Specifically, our focus lies in areas such as Embodied AI, Games, UI Control, and Planning. To this end, we introduce a process of adapting an MLLM to a Generalist Embodied Agent (GEA). GEA is a single unified model capable of grounding itself across these varied domains through a multi-embodiment action tokenizer. GEA is trained with supervised learning on a large dataset of embodied experiences and with online RL in interactive simulators. We explore the data and algorithmic choices necessary to develop such a model. Our findings reveal the importance of training with cross-domain data and online RL for building generalist agents. The final GEA model achieves strong generalization performance to unseen tasks across diverse benchmarks compared to other generalist models and benchmark-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task of embodied AI that requires the agent to find a target object in unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging as it demands both perceptual and cognitive processes for effective perception and decision-making. While perception has gained significant progress powered by the rapidly developed visual foundation models, the progress on the cognitive side remains limited to either implicitly learning from massive navigation demonstrations or explicitly leveraging pre-defined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that humans consistently update their cognitive states while searching for objects in unseen environments, we present CogNav, which attempts to model this cognitive process with the help of large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process with a finite state machine composed of cognitive states ranging from exploration to identification. The transitions between the states are determined by a large language model based on an online built heterogeneous cognitive map containing spatial and semantic information of the scene being explored. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world environments demonstrate that our cognitive modeling significantly improves ObjectNav efficiency, with human-like navigation behaviors. In an open-vocabulary and zero-shot setting, our method advances the SOTA of the HM3D benchmark from 69.3% to 87.2%. The code and data will be released.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we study how to best ground a MLLM into different embodiments and their associated action spaces, with the goal of leveraging the multimodal world knowledge of the MLLM. We first generalize a number of methods through a unified architecture and the lens of action space adaptors. For continuous actions, we show that a learned tokenization allows for sufficient modeling precision, yielding the best performance on downstream tasks. For discrete actions, we demonstrate that semantically aligning these actions with the native output token space of the MLLM leads to the strongest performance. We arrive at these lessons via a thorough study of seven action space adapters on five different environments, encompassing over 114 embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, previous work has been scattered across diverse simulation platforms, with assets and models lacking unified interfaces, which has led to inefficiencies in research. To address this, we introduce InfiniteWorld, a unified and scalable simulator for general vision-language robot interaction built on Nvidia Isaac Sim. InfiniteWorld encompasses a comprehensive set of physics asset construction methods and generalized free robot interaction benchmarks. Specifically, we first built a unified and scalable simulation framework for embodied learning that integrates a series of improvements in generation-driven 3D asset construction, Real2Sim, automated annotation framework, and unified 3D asset processing. This framework provides a unified and scalable platform for robot interaction and learning. In addition, to simulate realistic robot interaction, we build four new general benchmarks, including scene graph collaborative exploration and open-world social mobile manipulation. The former is often overlooked as an important task for robots to explore the environment and build scene knowledge, while the latter simulates robot interaction tasks with different levels of knowledge agents based on the former. They can more comprehensively evaluate the embodied agent's capabilities in environmental understanding, task planning and execution, and intelligent interaction. We hope that this work can provide the community with a systematic asset interface, alleviate the dilemma of the lack of high-quality assets, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of robot interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

This study finds that state-of-the-art embodied AI agents compete for higher navigation quality, but often compromise the computational efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce "Skip-SCAR," an optimization framework that builds computationally and memory-efficient embodied AI agents to accomplish high-quality visual navigation tasks. Skip-SCAR opportunistically skips the redundant step computations during semantic segmentation and local re-planning without hurting the navigation quality. Skip-SCAR also adopts a novel hybrid sparse and dense network for object prediction, optimizing both the computation and memory footprint. Tested on the HM3D ObjectNav datasets and real-world physical hardware systems, Skip-SCAR not only minimizes hardware resources but also sets new performance benchmarks, demonstrating the benefits of optimizing both navigation quality and computational efficiency for robotics.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |

Privacy emerges as a pivotal concern within the realm of embodied AI, as the robot accesses substantial personal information. However, the issue of privacy leakage in embodied AI tasks, particularly concerning reinforcement learning algorithms, has not received adequate consideration in research. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an attack on the training process of the value-based algorithm and the gradient-based algorithm, utilizing gradient inversion to reconstruct states, actions, and supervisory signals. The choice of using gradients for the attack is motivated by the fact that commonly employed federated learning techniques solely utilize gradients computed based on private user data to optimize models, without storing or transmitting the data to public servers. Nevertheless, these gradients contain sufficient information to potentially expose private data. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on the AI2THOR simulator and evaluated our algorithm on active perception, a prevalent task in embodied AI. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in successfully reconstructing all information from the data in 120 room layouts.

In this paper, we propose TANGO, an approach that extends the program composition via LLMs already observed for images, aiming to integrate those capabilities into embodied agents capable of observing and acting in the world. Specifically, by employing a simple PointGoal Navigation model combined with a memory-based exploration policy as a foundational primitive for guiding an agent through the world, we show how a single model can address diverse tasks without additional training. We task an LLM with composing the provided primitives to solve a specific task, using only a few in-context examples in the prompt. We evaluate our approach on three key Embodied AI tasks: Open-Set ObjectGoal Navigation, Multi-Modal Lifelong Navigation, and Open Embodied Question Answering, achieving state-of-the-art results without any specific fine-tuning in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functionality understanding and segmentation in 3D scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16310v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding functionalities in 3D scenes involves interpreting natural language descriptions to locate functional interactive objects, such as handles and buttons, in a 3D environment. Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

Despite recent advancements in Neural Implicit Representations (NIR), existing methods often lack editability and compositional flexibility, limiting their use in scenarios requiring high interactivity and object-level manipulation. In this paper, we introduce the Gaussian Object Carver (GOC), a novel, efficient, and scalable framework for object-compositional 3D scene reconstruction. GOC leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), enriched with monocular geometry priors and multi-view geometry regularization, to achieve high-quality and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a zero-shot Object Surface Completion (OSC) model, which uses 3D priors from 3d object data to reconstruct unobserved surfaces, ensuring object completeness even in occluded areas. Experimental results demonstrate that GOC improves reconstruction efficiency and geometric fidelity. It holds promise for advancing the practical application of digital twins in embodied AI, AR/VR, and interactive simulation environments.</p></details> |  |

Many LLM-based planners are inefficient due to their large number of parameters and prone to inaccuracies because they operate in open-loop systems. We think the reason is that only applying LLMs as planners is insufficient. In this work, we propose DaDu-E, a robust closed-loop planning framework for embodied AI robots. Specifically, DaDu-E is equipped with a relatively lightweight LLM, a set of encapsulated robot skill instructions, a robust feedback system, and memory augmentation. Together, these components enable DaDu-E to (i) actively perceive and adapt to dynamic environments, (ii) optimize computational costs while maintaining high performance, and (iii) recover from execution failures using its memory and feedback mechanisms. Extensive experiments on real-world and simulated tasks show that DaDu-E achieves task success rates comparable to embodied AI robots with larger models as planners like COME-Robot, while reducing computational requirements by $6.6 \times$. Users are encouraged to explore our system at: \url{https://rlc-lab.github.io/dadu-e/}.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 figures, submitted to JFR</p></details> |

Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered by current works. In this work, we address this shortcoming and introduce (1) an expertly curated dataset in the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, featuring high-quality manual annotations, for instance, segmentation and articulation on 280 indoor scenes; (2) a learning-based model together with a novel baseline capable of predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes, including motion type, articulated and interactable parts, and motion parameters; (3) a benchmark serving to compare upcoming methods for the task at hand. Overall, our dataset provides 8 types of annotations - object and part segmentations, motion types, movable and interactable parts, motion parameters, connectivity, and object mass annotations. With its broad and high-quality annotations, the data provides the basis for holistic 3D scene understanding models. All data is provided in the USD format, allowing interoperability and easy integration with downstream tasks. We provide open access to our dataset, benchmark, and method's source code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Right Place, Right Time! Generalizing ObjectNav to Dynamic Environments with Portable Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09905v2)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ObjectNav is a popular task in Embodied AI, where an agent navigates to a target object in an unseen environment. Prior literature makes the assumption of a static environment with stationary objects, which lacks realism. To address this, we present a novel formulation to generalize ObjectNav to dynamic environments with non-stationary objects, and refer to it as Portable ObjectNav or P-ObjectNav. In our formulation, we first address several challenging issues with dynamizing existing topological scene graphs by developing a novel method that introduces multiple transition behaviors to portable objects in the scene. We use this technique to dynamize Matterport3D, a popular simulator for evaluating embodied tasks. We then present a benchmark for P-ObjectNav using a combination of heuristic, reinforcement learning, and Large Language Model (LLM)-based navigation approaches on the dynamized environment, while introducing novel evaluation metrics tailored for our task. Our work fundamentally challenges the "static-environment" notion of prior ObjectNav work; the code and dataset for P-ObjectNav will be made publicly available to foster research on embodied navigation in dynamic scenes. We provide an anonymized repository for our code and dataset: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PObjectNav-1C6D.</p></details> | 19 |
| **[Learning Reward and Policy Jointly from Demonstration and Preference Improves Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06874v3)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for building contemporary foundation models and embodied AI. However, popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) break down the task into successive stages, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling (RM), and reinforcement learning (RL), each performing one specific learning task. Such a sequential approach results in serious issues such as significant under-utilization of data and distribution mismatch between the learned reward model and generated policy, which eventually lead to poor alignment performance. We develop a single stage approach named Alignment with Integrated Human Feedback (AIHF), capable of integrating both human preference and demonstration to train reward models and the policy. The proposed approach admits a suite of efficient algorithms, which can easily reduce to, and leverage, popular alignment algorithms such as RLHF and Directly Policy Optimization (DPO), and only requires minor changes to the existing alignment pipelines. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solutions with extensive experiments involving alignment problems in LLMs and robotic control problems in MuJoCo. We observe that the proposed solutions outperform the existing alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO by large margins, especially when the amount of high-quality preference data is relatively limited.</p></details> |  |
| **[EARBench: Towards Evaluating Physical Risk Awareness for Task Planning of Foundation Model-based Embodied AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04449v5)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied artificial intelligence (EAI) integrates advanced AI models into physical entities for real-world interaction. The emergence of foundation models as the "brain" of EAI agents for high-level task planning has shown promising results. However, the deployment of these agents in physical environments presents significant safety challenges. For instance, a housekeeping robot lacking sufficient risk awareness might place a metal container in a microwave, potentially causing a fire. To address these critical safety concerns, comprehensive pre-deployment risk assessments are imperative. This study introduces EARBench, a novel framework for automated physical risk assessment in EAI scenarios. EAIRiskBench employs a multi-agent cooperative system that leverages various foundation models to generate safety guidelines, create risk-prone scenarios, make task planning, and evaluate safety systematically. Utilizing this framework, we construct EARDataset, comprising diverse test cases across various domains, encompassing both textual and visual scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art foundation models reveals alarming results: all models exhibit high task risk rates (TRR), with an average of 95.75% across all evaluated models. To address these challenges, we further propose two prompting-based risk mitigation strategies. While these strategies demonstrate some efficacy in reducing TRR, the improvements are limited, still indicating substantial safety concerns. This study provides the first large-scale assessment of physical risk awareness in EAI agents. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced safety measures in EAI systems and provide valuable insights for future research directions in developing safer embodied artificial intelligence system.

Representative artificial neural networks in these fields span convolutional neural networks, Transformers, and deep Q-networks. Built upon unimodal neural networks, numerous multi-modal models have been introduced to address a range of tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, and speech recognition. The rise of instruction-following robotic policies in embodied AI has spurred the development of a novel category of multi-modal models known as vision-language-action models (VLAs). Their multi-modality capability has become a foundational element in robot learning. Various methods have been proposed to enhance traits such as versatility, dexterity, and generalizability. Some models focus on refining specific components. Others aim to develop control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. Certain VLAs serve as high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into executable subtasks. Over the past few years, a myriad of VLAs have emerged, reflecting the rapid advancement of embodied AI.

However, when powered with open large language models (LLMs), these agents often struggle with rudimentary tasks, even when fine-tuned on domain-specific knowledge. Inspired by human cultural learning, we present \collabvoyager, a novel framework that enhances Voyager with lifelong collaborative learning through explicit perspective-taking. \collabvoyager introduces three key innovations: (1) theory of mind representations linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural language communication between agents; and (3) semantic memory of task and environment knowledge and episodic memory of collaboration episodes. These advancements enable agents to reason about their and others' mental states, empirically addressing two prevalent failure modes: false beliefs and faulty task executions. In mixed-expertise Minecraft experiments, \collabvoyager agents outperform Voyager counterparts, significantly improving task completion rate by $66.6\% (+39.4\%)$ for collecting one block of dirt and $70.8\% (+20.8\%)$ for collecting one wood block. They exhibit emergent behaviors like knowledge transfer from expert to novice agents and collaborative code correction. \collabvoyager agents also demonstrate the ability to adapt to out-of-distribution tasks by using their previous experiences and beliefs obtained through collaboration. In this open-ended social learning paradigm, \collabvoyager paves the way for the democratic development of embodied AI, where agents learn in deployment from both peer and environmental feedback.</p></details> |  |

However, for sequential decision-making problems, such as robotics, action-labelled data is often scarce and therefore scaling-up foundation models for decision-making remains a challenge. A potential solution lies in leveraging widely-available unlabelled videos to train world models that simulate the consequences of actions. If the world model is accurate, it can be used to optimize decision-making in downstream tasks. Image-to-video diffusion models are already capable of generating highly realistic synthetic videos. However, these models are not action-conditioned, and the most powerful models are closed-source which means they cannot be finetuned. In this work, we propose to adapt pretrained video diffusion models to action-conditioned world models, without access to the parameters of the pretrained model. Our approach, AVID, trains an adapter on a small domain-specific dataset of action-labelled videos. AVID uses a learned mask to modify the intermediate outputs of the pretrained model and generate accurate action-conditioned videos. We evaluate AVID on video game and real-world robotics data, and show that it outperforms existing baselines for diffusion model adaptation.1 Our results demonstrate that if utilized correctly, pretrained video models have the potential to be powerful tools for embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/avid-world-model-adapters/home</p></details> |

In this study, we introduce ROOT, a VLM-based system designed to enhance the analysis of indoor scenes. Specifically, we first develop an iterative object perception algorithm using GPT-4V to detect object entities within indoor scenes. This is followed by employing vision foundation models to acquire additional meta-information about the scene, such as bounding boxes. Building on this foundational data, we propose a specialized VLM, SceneVLM, which is capable of generating spatial hierarchical scene graphs and providing distance information for objects within indoor environments. This information enhances our understanding of the spatial arrangement of indoor scenes. To train our SceneVLM, we collect over 610,000 images from various public indoor datasets and implement a scene data generation pipeline with a semi-automated technique to establish relationships and estimate distances among indoor objects. By utilizing this enriched data, we conduct various training recipes and finish SceneVLM. Our experiments demonstrate that \rootname facilitates indoor scene understanding and proves effective in diverse downstream applications, such as 3D scene generation and embodied AI.

However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs and 3D segmentation masks. In addition, we design MORE3D, a simple yet effective method that enables multi-object 3D reasoning segmentation with user questions and textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative World Explorer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11844v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |

However, existing datasets and benchmarks for situated understanding are limited in data modality, diversity, scale, and task scope. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-modal Situated Question Answering (MSQA), a large-scale multi-modal situated reasoning dataset, scalably collected leveraging 3D scene graphs and vision-language models (VLMs) across a diverse range of real-world 3D scenes. MSQA includes 251K situated question-answering pairs across 9 distinct question categories, covering complex scenarios within 3D scenes. We introduce a novel interleaved multi-modal input setting in our benchmark to provide text, image, and point cloud for situation and question description, resolving ambiguity in previous single-modality convention (e.g., text). Additionally, we devise the Multi-modal Situated Next-step Navigation (MSNN) benchmark to evaluate models' situated reasoning for navigation. Comprehensive evaluations on MSQA and MSNN highlight the limitations of existing vision-language models and underscore the importance of handling multi-modal interleaved inputs and situation modeling. Experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer further demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging MSQA as a pre-training dataset for developing more powerful situated reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame-basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes Corki, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI robot control. Our idea is to decouple LLM inference, robotic control and data communication in the embodied AI robots compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, Corki predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. Corki largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to 8.0x, resulting in up to 3.6x speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 17.3%. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/hyy0613/Corki</p></details> |  |

Generated models frequently fail to maintain balance when placed in physics-based simulations or 3D printed. This balance is crucial for satisfying user design intentions in interactive gaming, embodied AI, and robotics, where stable models are needed for reliable interaction. Additionally, stable models ensure that 3D-printed objects, such as figurines for home decoration, can stand on their own without requiring additional supports. To fill this gap, we introduce Atlas3D, an automatic and easy-to-implement method that enhances existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based text-to-3D tools. Atlas3D ensures the generation of self-supporting 3D models that adhere to physical laws of stability under gravity, contact, and friction. Our approach combines a novel differentiable simulation-based loss function with physically inspired regularization, serving as either a refinement or a post-processing module for existing frameworks. We verify Atlas3D's efficacy through extensive generation tasks and validate the resulting 3D models in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yunuoch.github.io/Atlas3D/</p></details> |

Current methods, including manual design, procedural generation, diffusion-based scene generation, and large language model (LLM) guided scene design, are hindered by limitations such as excessive human effort, reliance on predefined rules or training datasets, and limited 3D spatial reasoning ability. Since pre-trained 2D image generative models better capture scene and object configuration than LLMs, we address these challenges by introducing Architect, a generative framework that creates complex and realistic 3D embodied environments leveraging diffusion-based 2D image inpainting. In detail, we utilize foundation visual perception models to obtain each generated object from the image and leverage pre-trained depth estimation models to lift the generated 2D image to 3D space. Our pipeline is further extended to a hierarchical and iterative inpainting process to continuously generate placement of large furniture and small objects to enrich the scene. This iterative structure brings the flexibility for our method to generate or refine scenes from various starting points, such as text, floor plans, or pre-arranged environments.</p></details> |  |

Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, \textit{i.e.}, pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the strategy of representation. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multi-faceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multi-modal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions. We have also set up a Github repository to organize the papers included in this survey at: \url{https://github.com/ChaofanTao/Autoregressive-Models-in-Vision-Survey}.</p></details> |  |

Scene Retrieval with Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14565v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language interfaces to embodied AI are becoming more ubiquitous in our daily lives. This opens up further opportunities for language-based interaction with embodied agents, such as a user verbally instructing an agent to execute some task in a specific location. For example, "put the bowls back in the cupboard next to the fridge" or "meet me at the intersection under the red sign." As such, we need methods that interface between natural language and map representations of the environment. To this end, we explore the question of whether we can use an open-set natural language query to identify a scene represented by a 3D scene graph. We define this task as "language-based scene-retrieval" and it is closely related to "coarse-localization," but we are instead searching for a match from a collection of disjoint scenes and not necessarily a large-scale continuous map. We present Text2SceneGraphMatcher, a "scene-retrieval" pipeline that learns joint embeddings between text descriptions and scene graphs to determine if they are a match. The code, trained models, and datasets will be made public.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios.

To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

We propose the Human-Aware 3D (HA3D) simulator, which combines dynamic human activities with the Matterport3D dataset, and the Human-Aware Room-to-Room (HA-R2R) dataset, extending R2R with human activity descriptions. To tackle HA-VLN challenges, we present the Expert-Supervised Cross-Modal (VLN-CM) and Non-Expert-Supervised Decision Transformer (VLN-DT) agents, utilizing cross-modal fusion and diverse training strategies for effective navigation in dynamic human environments. A comprehensive evaluation, including metrics considering human activities, and systematic analysis of HA-VLN's unique challenges, underscores the need for further research to enhance HA-VLN agents' real-world robustness and adaptability. Ultimately, this work provides benchmarks and insights for future research on embodied AI and Sim2Real transfer, paving the way for more realistic and applicable VLN systems in human-populated environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spotl...</summary><p>Spotlight at NeurIPS 2024 D&B Track. 32 pages, 18 figures, Project Page: https://lpercc.github.io/HA3D_simulator/</p></details> |
| **[Embodied AI with Two Arms: Zero-shot Learning, Safety and Modularity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03570v3)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an embodied AI system which receives open-ended natural language instructions from a human, and controls two arms to collaboratively accomplish potentially long-horizon tasks over a large workspace. Our system is modular: it deploys state of the art Large Language Models for task planning,Vision-Language models for semantic perception, and Point Cloud transformers for grasping. With semantic and physical safety in mind, these modules are interfaced with a real-time trajectory optimizer and a compliant tracking controller to enable human-robot proximity. We demonstrate performance for the following tasks: bi-arm sorting, bottle opening, and trash disposal tasks. These are done zero-shot where the models used have not been trained with any real world data from this bi-arm robot, scenes or workspace. Composing both learning- and non-learning-based components in a modular fashion with interpretable inputs and outputs allows the user to easily debug points of failures and fragilities. One may also in-place swap modules to improve the robustness of the overall platform, for instance with imitation-learned policies.

| **[NeuronsGym: A Hybrid Framework and Benchmark for Robot Tasks with Sim2Real Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03385v2)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of embodied AI has greatly improved the possibility of general mobile agent systems. At present, many evaluation platforms with rich scenes, high visual fidelity and various application scenarios have been developed. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework named NeuronsGym that can be used for policy learning of robot tasks, covering a simulation platform for training policy, and a physical system for studying sim2real problems. Unlike most current single-task, slow-moving robotic platforms, our framework provides agile physical robots with a wider range of speeds, and can be employed to train robotic navigation and confrontation policies. At the same time, in order to evaluate the safety of robot navigation, we propose a safety-weighted path length (SFPL) to improve the safety evaluation in the current mobile robot navigation. Based on this platform, we build a new benchmark for navigation and confrontation tasks under this platform by comparing the current mainstream sim2real methods, and hold the 2022 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG) RoboMaster sim2real challenge. We release the codes of this framework\footnote{\url{https://github.com/DRL-CASIA/NeuronsGym}} and hope that this platform can promote the development of more flexible and agile general mobile agent algorithms.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[EnvBridge: Bridging Diverse Environments with Cross-Environment Knowledge Transfer for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16919v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated high reasoning capabilities, drawing attention for their applications as agents in various decision-making processes. One notably promising application of LLM agents is robotic manipulation. Recent research has shown that LLMs can generate text planning or control code for robots, providing substantial flexibility and interaction capabilities. However, these methods still face challenges in terms of flexibility and applicability across different environments, limiting their ability to adapt autonomously. Current approaches typically fall into two categories: those relying on environment-specific policy training, which restricts their transferability, and those generating code actions based on fixed prompts, which leads to diminished performance when confronted with new environments. These limitations significantly constrain the generalizability of agents in robotic manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called EnvBridge. This approach involves the retention and transfer of successful robot control codes from source environments to target environments. EnvBridge enhances the agent's adaptability and performance across diverse settings by leveraging insights from multiple environments. Notably, our approach alleviates environmental constraints, offering a more flexible and generalizable solution for robotic manipulation tasks. We validated the effectiveness of our method using robotic manipulation benchmarks: RLBench, MetaWorld, and CALVIN. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM agents can successfully leverage diverse knowledge sources to solve complex tasks. Consequently, our approach significantly enhances the adaptability and robustness of robotic manipulation agents in planning across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

When integrated into an embodied agent, existing embodied VLM works either output detailed action sequences at the manipulation level or only provide plans at an abstract level, leaving a gap between high-level planning and real-world manipulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Octopus, an embodied vision-language programmer that uses executable code generation as a medium to connect planning and manipulation. Octopus is designed to 1) proficiently comprehend an agent's visual and textual task objectives, 2) formulate intricate action sequences, and 3) generate executable code. To facilitate Octopus model development, we introduce OctoVerse: a suite of environments tailored for benchmarking vision-based code generators on a wide spectrum of tasks, ranging from mundane daily chores in simulators to sophisticated interactions in complex video games such as Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Minecraft. To train Octopus, we leverage GPT-4 to control an explorative agent that generates training data, i.e., action blueprints and corresponding executable code. We also collect feedback that enables an enhanced training scheme called Reinforcement Learning with Environmental Feedback (RLEF). Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate Octopus's functionality and present compelling results, showing that the proposed RLEF refines the agent's decision-making. By open-sourcing our simulation environments, dataset, and model architecture, we aspire to ignite further innovation and foster collaborative applications within the broader embodied AI community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://choiszt.github.io/Octopus/, Codebase: https://github.com/dongyh20/Octopus</p></details> |
| **[Multi-LLM QA with Embodied Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10918v5)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have grown in popularity due to their natural language interface and pre trained knowledge, leading to rapidly increasing success in question-answering (QA) tasks. More recently, multi-agent systems with LLM-based agents (Multi-LLM) have been utilized increasingly more for QA. In these scenarios, the models may each answer the question and reach a consensus or each model is specialized to answer different domain questions. However, most prior work dealing with Multi-LLM QA has focused on scenarios where the models are asked in a zero-shot manner or are given information sources to extract the answer. For question answering of an unknown environment, embodied exploration of the environment is first needed to answer the question. This skill is necessary for personalizing embodied AI to environments such as households. There is a lack of insight into whether a Multi-LLM system can handle question-answering based on observations from embodied exploration. In this work, we address this gap by investigating the use of Multi-Embodied LLM Explorers (MELE) for QA in an unknown environment. Multiple LLM-based agents independently explore and then answer queries about a household environment. We analyze different aggregation methods to generate a single, final answer for each query: debating, majority voting, and training a central answer module (CAM). Using CAM, we observe a $46\%$ higher accuracy compared against the other non-learning-based aggregation methods. We provide code and the query dataset for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

Through this unified latent action space, IGOR enables knowledge transfer among large-scale robot and human activity data. We achieve this by compressing visual changes between an initial image and its goal state into latent actions. IGOR allows us to generate latent action labels for internet-scale video data. This unified latent action space enables the training of foundation policy and world models across a wide variety of tasks performed by both robots and humans. We demonstrate that: (1) IGOR learns a semantically consistent action space for both human and robots, characterizing various possible motions of objects representing the physical interaction knowledge; (2) IGOR can "migrate" the movements of the object in the one video to other videos, even across human and robots, by jointly using the latent action model and world model; (3) IGOR can learn to align latent actions with natural language through the foundation policy model, and integrate latent actions with a low-level policy model to achieve effective robot control. We believe IGOR opens new possibilities for human-to-robot knowledge transfer and control.</p></details> |  |

Simulation platforms play a crucial role in advancing this field by enabling the validation and optimization of algorithms. However, existing platforms face challenges such as multilevel technical integration complexity, insufficient modularity, interface heterogeneity, and adaptation to diverse hardware. We present BestMan, a simulation platform based on PyBullet, designed to address these issues. BestMan introduces an integrated multilevel skill chain for seamless coordination across perception, planning, and control; a highly modular architecture for flexible algorithm integration; unified interfaces for smooth simulation-to-reality transfer; and a hardware-agnostic approach for adapting to various mobile manipulator configurations. These features collectively simplify development and enhance platform expandability, making BestMan a valuable tool for Embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |

Majority of prior arts adhere to an open-loop philosophy and lack real-time feedback, leading to error accumulation and undesirable robustness. A handful of approaches have endeavored to establish feedback mechanisms leveraging pixel-level differences or pre-trained visual representations, yet their efficacy and adaptability have been found to be constrained. Inspired by classic closed-loop control systems, we propose CLOVER, a closed-loop visuomotor control framework that incorporates feedback mechanisms to improve adaptive robotic control. CLOVER consists of a text-conditioned video diffusion model for generating visual plans as reference inputs, a measurable embedding space for accurate error quantification, and a feedback-driven controller that refines actions from feedback and initiates replans as needed. Our framework exhibits notable advancement in real-world robotic tasks and achieves state-of-the-art on CALVIN benchmark, improving by 8% over previous open-loop counterparts.

Building on previous work, EgoThink, we introduce VidEgoThink, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating egocentric video understanding capabilities. To bridge the gap between MLLMs and low-level control in Embodied AI, we design four key interrelated tasks: video question-answering, hierarchy planning, visual grounding and reward modeling. To minimize manual annotation costs, we develop an automatic data generation pipeline based on the Ego4D dataset, leveraging the prior knowledge and multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o. Three human annotators then filter the generated data to ensure diversity and quality, resulting in the VidEgoThink benchmark. We conduct extensive experiments with three types of models: API-based MLLMs, open-source image-based MLLMs, and open-source video-based MLLMs. Experimental results indicate that all MLLMs, including GPT-4o, perform poorly across all tasks related to egocentric video understanding. These findings suggest that foundation models still require significant advancements to be effectively applied to first-person scenarios in Embodied AI. In conclusion, VidEgoThink reflects a research trend towards employing MLLMs for egocentric vision, akin to human capabilities, enabling active observation and interaction in the complex real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[M2Diffuser: Diffusion-based Trajectory Optimization for Mobile Manipulation in 3D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11402v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have opened new avenues for research into embodied AI agents and robotics. Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation-a capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulation-remains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[EgoChoir: Capturing 3D Human-Object Interaction Regions from Egocentric Views](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13659v2)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding egocentric human-object interaction (HOI) is a fundamental aspect of human-centric perception, facilitating applications like AR/VR and embodied AI. For the egocentric HOI, in addition to perceiving semantics e.g., ''what'' interaction is occurring, capturing ''where'' the interaction specifically manifests in 3D space is also crucial, which links the perception and operation. Existing methods primarily leverage observations of HOI to capture interaction regions from an exocentric view. However, incomplete observations of interacting parties in the egocentric view introduce ambiguity between visual observations and interaction contents, impairing their efficacy. From the egocentric view, humans integrate the visual cortex, cerebellum, and brain to internalize their intentions and interaction concepts of objects, allowing for the pre-formulation of interactions and making behaviors even when interaction regions are out of sight. In light of this, we propose harmonizing the visual appearance, head motion, and 3D object to excavate the object interaction concept and subject intention, jointly inferring 3D human contact and object affordance from egocentric videos. To achieve this, we present EgoChoir, which links object structures with interaction contexts inherent in appearance and head motion to reveal object affordance, further utilizing it to model human contact. Additionally, a gradient modulation is employed to adopt appropriate clues for capturing interaction regions across various egocentric scenarios. Moreover, 3D contact and affordance are annotated for egocentric videos collected from Ego-Exo4D and GIMO to support the task. Extensive experiments on them demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of EgoChoir.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS2024, project: https://yyvhang.github.io/EgoChoir/</p></details> |

Accomplishing this goal requires learning to ground language in perception and embodied actions, in order to accomplish complex tasks. The Scalable, Instructable, Multiworld Agent (SIMA) project tackles this by training agents to follow free-form instructions across a diverse range of virtual 3D environments, including curated research environments as well as open-ended, commercial video games. Our goal is to develop an instructable agent that can accomplish anything a human can do in any simulated 3D environment. Our approach focuses on language-driven generality while imposing minimal assumptions. Our agents interact with environments in real-time using a generic, human-like interface: the inputs are image observations and language instructions and the outputs are keyboard-and-mouse actions. This general approach is challenging, but it allows agents to ground language across many visually complex and semantically rich environments while also allowing us to readily run agents in new environments. In this paper we describe our motivation and goal, the initial progress we have made, and promising preliminary results on several diverse research environments and a variety of commercial video games.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Robotics and Embodied AI make public urban spaces no longer exclusive to humans. Food delivery bots and electric wheelchairs have started sharing sidewalks with pedestrians, while robot dogs and humanoids have recently emerged in the street. Micromobility enabled by AI for short-distance travel in public urban spaces plays a crucial component in the future transportation system. Ensuring the generalizability and safety of AI models maneuvering mobile machines is essential. In this work, we present MetaUrban, a compositional simulation platform for the AI-driven urban micromobility research. MetaUrban can construct an infinite number of interactive urban scenes from compositional elements, covering a vast array of ground plans, object placements, pedestrians, vulnerable road users, and other mobile agents' appearances and dynamics. We design point navigation and social navigation tasks as the pilot study using MetaUrban for urban micromobility research and establish various baselines of Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning. We conduct extensive evaluation across mobile machines, demonstrating that heterogeneous mechanical structures significantly influence the learning and execution of AI policies. We perform a thorough ablation study, showing that the compositional nature of the simulated environments can substantially improve the generalizability and safety of the trained mobile agents. MetaUrban will be made publicly available to provide research opportunities and foster safe and trustworthy embodied AI and micromobility in cities.

Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning.

Hand motion models with the sophistication to accurately recreate piano playing have a wide range of applications in character animation, embodied AI, biomechanics, and VR/AR. In this paper, we construct a first-of-its-kind large-scale dataset that contains approximately 10 hours of 3D hand motion and audio from 15 elite-level pianists playing 153 pieces of classical music. To capture natural performances, we designed a markerless setup in which motions are reconstructed from multi-view videos using state-of-the-art pose estimation models. The motion data is further refined via inverse kinematics using the high-resolution MIDI key-pressing data obtained from sensors in a specialized Yamaha Disklavier piano. Leveraging the collected dataset, we developed a pipeline that can synthesize physically-plausible hand motions for musical scores outside of the dataset. Our approach employs a combination of imitation learning and reinforcement learning to obtain policies for physics-based bimanual control involving the interaction between hands and piano keys. To solve the sampling efficiency problem with the large motion dataset, we use a diffusion model to generate natural reference motions, which provide high-level trajectory and fingering (finger order and placement) information. However, the generated reference motion alone does not provide sufficient accuracy for piano performance modeling. We then further augmented the data by using musical similarity to retrieve similar motions from the captured dataset to boost the precision of the RL policy. With the proposed method, our model generates natural, dexterous motions that generalize to music from outside the training dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH Asia 2024.

Despite the recent progress in Embodied AI, it is still very challenging to learn the generalizable manipulation skills that can handle large deformation and topological changes on soft-body objects, such as clay, water, and soil. In this work, we proposed an effective policy, namely GP2E behavior cloning policy, which can guide the agent to learn the generalizable manipulation skills from soft-body tasks, including pouring, filling, hanging, excavating, pinching, and writing. Concretely, we build our policy from three insights:(1) Extracting intricate semantic features from point cloud data and seamlessly integrating them into the robot's end-effector frame; (2) Capturing long-distance interactions in long-horizon tasks through the incorporation of our guided self-attention module; (3) Mitigating overfitting concerns and facilitating model convergence to higher accuracy levels via the introduction of our two-stage fine-tuning strategy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by achieving the 1st prize in the soft-body track of the ManiSkill2 Challenge at the CVPR 2023 4th Embodied AI workshop. Our findings highlight the potential of our method to improve the generalization abilities of Embodied AI models and pave the way for their practical applications in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality-Aware Transformer Networks for Robotic Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02669v2)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research in Visual Navigation reveals opportunities for improvement. First, the direct adoption of RNNs and Transformers often overlooks the specific differences between Embodied AI and traditional sequential data modelling, potentially limiting its performance in Embodied AI tasks. Second, the reliance on task-specific configurations, such as pre-trained modules and dataset-specific logic, compromises the generalizability of these methods. We address these constraints by initially exploring the unique differences between Navigation tasks and other sequential data tasks through the lens of Causality, presenting a causal framework to elucidate the inadequacies of conventional sequential methods for Navigation. By leveraging this causal perspective, we propose Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) Networks for Navigation, featuring a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the models's Environmental Understanding capability. Meanwhile, our method is devoid of task-specific inductive biases and can be trained in an End-to-End manner, which enhances the method's generalizability across various contexts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our methodology consistently surpasses benchmark performances across a spectrum of settings, tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablation studies reveal that the performance gains can be attributed to the Causal Understanding Module, which demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency in both Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Learning settings.</p></details> |  |

Exploring Backdoor Attacks against Embodied LLM-based Decision-Making Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20774v2)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in real-world decision-making tasks for embodied artificial intelligence, especially when fine-tuned to leverage their inherent common sense and reasoning abilities while being tailored to specific applications. However, this fine-tuning process introduces considerable safety and security vulnerabilities, especially in safety-critical cyber-physical systems. In this work, we propose the first comprehensive framework for Backdoor Attacks against LLM-based Decision-making systems (BALD) in embodied AI, systematically exploring the attack surfaces and trigger mechanisms. Specifically, we propose three distinct attack mechanisms: word injection, scenario manipulation, and knowledge injection, targeting various components in the LLM-based decision-making pipeline. We perform extensive experiments on representative LLMs (GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, PaLM2) in autonomous driving and home robot tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and stealthiness of our backdoor triggers across various attack channels, with cases like vehicles accelerating toward obstacles and robots placing knives on beds. Our word and knowledge injection attacks achieve nearly 100% success rate across multiple models and datasets while requiring only limited access to the system. Our scenario manipulation attack yields success rates exceeding 65%, reaching up to 90%, and does not require any runtime system intrusion. We also assess the robustness of these attacks against defenses, revealing their resilience. Our findings highlight critical security vulnerabilities in embodied LLM systems and emphasize the urgent need for safeguarding these systems to mitigate potential risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, including main paper, references, and appendix</p></details> |

However, there is still lack of study on how vision language models~(VLMs) behave when multi-modal task inputs are considered. Counterfactual planning that evaluates the model's reasoning ability over alternative task situations are also under exploited. In order to evaluate the planning ability of both multi-modal and counterfactual aspects, we propose ActPlan-1K. ActPlan-1K is a multi-modal planning benchmark constructed based on ChatGPT and household activity simulator iGibson2. The benchmark consists of 153 activities and 1,187 instances. Each instance describing one activity has a natural language task description and multiple environment images from the simulator. The gold plan of each instance is action sequences over the objects in provided scenes. Both the correctness and commonsense satisfaction are evaluated on typical VLMs. It turns out that current VLMs are still struggling at generating human-level procedural plans for both normal activities and counterfactual activities. We further provide automatic evaluation metrics by finetuning over BLEURT model to facilitate future research on our benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables, accepted to EMNLP 2024 main conference</p></details> |

With the advancement of embodied AI, robots are increasingly capable of satisfying human demands. Demand-driven navigation (DDN) is a task in which an agent must locate an object to satisfy a specified demand instruction, such as ``I am thirsty.'' The previous study typically assumes that each demand instruction requires only one object to be fulfilled and does not consider individual preferences. However, the realistic human demand may involve multiple objects. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-object Demand-driven Navigation (MO-DDN) benchmark, which addresses these nuanced aspects, including multi-object search and personal preferences, thus making the MO-DDN task more reflective of real-life scenarios compared to DDN. Building upon previous work, we employ the concept of ``attribute'' to tackle this new task. However, instead of solely relying on attribute features in an end-to-end manner like DDN, we propose a modular method that involves constructing a coarse-to-fine attribute-based exploration agent (C2FAgent). Our experimental results illustrate that this coarse-to-fine exploration strategy capitalizes on the advantages of attributes at various decision-making levels, resulting in superior performance compared to baseline methods.

For instance, a robot in an unfamiliar house initially wouldn't know the locations of objects needed for tasks and might perform inefficiently. However, as it gathers more experience, it should learn the layout of its environment and remember where objects are, allowing it to complete new tasks more efficiently. To enable such rapid adaptation to new tasks, we present ReLIC, a new approach for in-context reinforcement learning (RL) for embodied agents. With ReLIC, agents are capable of adapting to new environments using 64,000 steps of in-context experience with full attention while being trained through self-generated experience via RL. We achieve this by proposing a novel policy update scheme for on-policy RL called "partial updates'' as well as a Sink-KV mechanism that enables effective utilization of a long observation history for embodied agents. Our method outperforms a variety of meta-RL baselines in adapting to unseen houses in an embodied multi-object navigation task. In addition, we find that ReLIC is capable of few-shot imitation learning despite never being trained with expert demonstrations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of ReLIC, highlighting that the combination of large-scale RL training, the proposed partial updates scheme, and the Sink-KV are essential for effective in-context learning. The code for ReLIC and all our experiments is at https://github.com/aielawady/relic</p></details> |  |

However, real-world datasets often contain insufficient data to meet the training and evaluation requirements of models. Although synthetic datasets offer a larger volume of data, their acoustic simulations lack realism. Consequently, neither real-world nor synthetic datasets effectively fulfill practical needs. To address these issues, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit de-designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim is developed based on the embodied AI simulation platform, Habitat-sim, supporting multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level, thereby generating more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a moving sound source benchmark dataset, SonicSet, using the Librispeech, the Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K) and Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from the Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to validate the differences between synthetic data and real-world data, we randomly selected 5 hours of raw data without reverberation from the SonicSet validation set to record a real-world speech separation dataset, which was then compared with the corresponding synthetic datasets. Similarly, we utilized the real-world speech enhancement dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between other synthetic datasets and the SonicSet dataset for speech enhancement. The results indicate that the synthetic data generated by SonicSim can effectively generalize to real-world scenarios. Demo and code are publicly available at https://cslikai.cn/SonicSim/.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[Generative Diffusion-based Contract Design for Efficient AI Twins Migration in Vehicular Embodied AI Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01176v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI is a rapidly advancing field that bridges the gap between cyberspace and physical space, enabling a wide range of applications. This evolution has led to the development of the Vehicular Embodied AI NETwork (VEANET), where advanced AI capabilities are integrated into vehicular systems to enhance autonomous operations and decision-making. Embodied agents, such as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are autonomous entities that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve specific goals, actively interacting with the physical world. Embodied twins are digital models of these embodied agents, with various embodied AI twins for intelligent applications in cyberspace. In VEANET, embodied AI twins act as in-vehicle AI assistants to perform diverse tasks supporting autonomous driving using generative AI models. Due to limited computational resources of AVs, these AVs often offload computationally intensive tasks, such as constructing and updating embodied AI twins, to nearby RSUs. However, since the rapid mobility of AVs and the limited provision coverage of a single RSU, embodied AI twins require dynamic migrations from current RSU to other RSUs in real-time, resulting in the challenge of selecting suitable RSUs for efficient embodied AI twins migrations. Given information asymmetry, AVs cannot know the detailed information of RSUs. To this end, in this paper, we construct a multi-dimensional contract theoretical model between AVs and alternative RSUs. Considering that AVs may exhibit irrational behavior, we utilize prospect theory instead of expected utility theory to model the actual utilities of AVs. Finally, we employ a generative diffusion model-based algorithm to identify the optimal contract designs. Compared with traditional deep reinforcement learning algorithms, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</p></details> |  |

However, many existing simulation frameworks typically support a narrow range of scenes/tasks and lack features critical for scaling generalizable robotics and sim2real. We introduce and open source ManiSkill3, the fastest state-visual GPU parallelized robotics simulator with contact-rich physics targeting generalizable manipulation. ManiSkill3 supports GPU parallelization of many aspects including simulation+rendering, heterogeneous simulation, pointclouds/voxels visual input, and more. Simulation with rendering on ManiSkill3 can run 10-1000x faster with 2-3x less GPU memory usage than other platforms, achieving up to 30,000+ FPS in benchmarked environments due to minimal python/pytorch overhead in the system, simulation on the GPU, and the use of the SAPIEN parallel rendering system. Tasks that used to take hours to train can now take minutes. We further provide the most comprehensive range of GPU parallelized environments/tasks spanning 12 distinct domains including but not limited to mobile manipulation for tasks such as drawing, humanoids, and dextrous manipulation in realistic scenes designed by artists or real-world digital twins. In addition, millions of demonstration frames are provided from motion planning, RL, and teleoperation. ManiSkill3 also provides a comprehensive set of baselines that span popular RL and learning-from-demonstrations algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://maniskill.ai/</p></details> |

We propose a direct yet effective method of monitoring the robot's current plan to detect changes in the environment that impact the intended trajectory of the robot significantly and then query a human for feedback. We also develop a means to parse human feedback expressed in natural language into local navigation waypoints and integrate it into a global planning system, by leveraging a map of semantic features and an aligned obstacle map. Extensive testing in simulation and physical hardware experiments with a resource-constrained wheeled robot tasked to navigate in a real-world environment validate the efficacy and robustness of our method. This work can support applications like precision agriculture and construction, where persistent monitoring of the environment provides a human with information about the environment state.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we aim to achieve both high model performance and practical deployability. Specifically, we focus on Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), a core task in Embodied AI. This paper introduces a two-stage knowledge distillation framework, producing a student model, MiniVLN, and showcasing the significant potential of distillation techniques in developing lightweight models. The proposed method aims to capture fine-grained knowledge during the pretraining phase and navigation-specific knowledge during the fine-tuning phase. Our findings indicate that the two-stage distillation approach is more effective in narrowing the performance gap between the teacher model and the student model compared to single-stage distillation. On the public R2R and REVERIE benchmarks, MiniVLN achieves performance on par with the teacher model while having only about 12% of the teacher model's parameter count.</p></details> |  |

On small form-factor devices, e.g., nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), such challenges are exacerbated by stringent constraints on energy efficiency and weight. In this paper, we explore embodied multi-modal AI-based perception for Nano-UAVs with the Kraken shield, a 7g multi-sensor (frame-based and event-based imagers) board based on Kraken, a 22 nm SoC featuring multiple acceleration engines for multi-modal event and frame-based inference based on spiking (SNN) and ternary (TNN) neural networks, respectively. Kraken can execute SNN real-time inference for depth estimation at 1.02k inf/s, 18 {\mu}J/inf, TNN real-time inference for object classification at 10k inf/s, 6 {\mu}J/inf, and real-time inference for obstacle avoidance at 221 frame/s, 750 {\mu}J/inf.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

While Next Best View (NBV) planning and Learning-based approaches offer solutions, they are often limited by predefined criteria and fail to manage occlusions with human-like common sense. To address these problems, we present AIR-Embodied, a novel framework that integrates embodied AI agents with large-scale pretrained multi-modal language models to improve active 3DGS reconstruction. AIR-Embodied utilizes a three-stage process: understanding the current reconstruction state via multi-modal prompts, planning tasks with viewpoint selection and interactive actions, and employing closed-loop reasoning to ensure accurate execution. The agent dynamically refines its actions based on discrepancies between the planned and actual outcomes. Experimental evaluations across virtual and real-world environments demonstrate that AIR-Embodied significantly enhances reconstruction efficiency and quality, providing a robust solution to challenges in active 3D reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReLEP: A Novel Framework for Real-world Long-horizon Embodied Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15658v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world long-horizon embodied planning underpins embodied AI. To accomplish long-horizon tasks, agents need to decompose abstract instructions into detailed steps. Prior works mostly rely on GPT-4V for task decomposition into predefined actions, which limits task diversity due to GPT-4V's finite understanding of larger skillsets. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a groundbreaking framework for Real world Long-horizon Embodied Planning, which can accomplish a wide range of daily tasks. At its core lies a fine-tuned large vision language model that formulates plans as sequences of skill functions according to input instruction and scene image. These functions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also equipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot Configuration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we propose a semi-automatic data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. Real-world off-line experiments across eight daily embodied tasks demonstrate that ReLEP is able to accomplish long-horizon embodied tasks and outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

This controller aims to manage a dexterous robot hand to manipulate diverse objects for various purposes defined by kinematic human-object interactions. Developing such a controller is complicated by the intricate contact dynamics of dexterous manipulation and the need for adaptivity, generalizability, and robustness. Current reinforcement learning and trajectory optimization methods often fall short due to their dependence on task-specific rewards or precise system models. We introduce an approach that curates large-scale successful robot tracking demonstrations, comprising pairs of human references and robot actions, to train a neural controller. Utilizing a data flywheel, we iteratively enhance the controller's performance, as well as the number and quality of successful tracking demonstrations. We exploit available tracking demonstrations and carefully integrate reinforcement learning and imitation learning to boost the controller's performance in dynamic environments. At the same time, to obtain high-quality tracking demonstrations, we individually optimize per-trajectory tracking by leveraging the learned tracking controller in a homotopy optimization method. The homotopy optimization, mimicking chain-of-thought, aids in solving challenging trajectory tracking problems to increase demonstration diversity. We showcase our success by training a generalizable neural controller and evaluating it in both simulation and real world. Our method achieves over a 10% improvement in success rates compared to leading baselines.

| **[OGBench: Benchmarking Offline Goal-Conditioned RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20092v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a major problem in reinforcement learning (RL) because it provides a simple, unsupervised, and domain-agnostic way to acquire diverse behaviors and representations from unlabeled data without rewards. Despite the importance of this setting, we lack a standard benchmark that can systematically evaluate the capabilities of offline GCRL algorithms. In this work, we propose OGBench, a new, high-quality benchmark for algorithms research in offline goal-conditioned RL. OGBench consists of 8 types of environments, 85 datasets, and reference implementations of 6 representative offline GCRL algorithms. We have designed these challenging and realistic environments and datasets to directly probe different capabilities of algorithms, such as stitching, long-horizon reasoning, and the ability to handle high-dimensional inputs and stochasticity. While representative algorithms may rank similarly on prior benchmarks, our experiments reveal stark strengths and weaknesses in these different capabilities, providing a strong foundation for building new algorithms.

Traditional sliding mode controllers with fixed parameters often struggle to maintain optimal performance under these fluctuating conditions. Therefore, an adaptive controller is essential to address these challenges by continuously tuning its gains in real-time. In this paper, we have tuned the slopes of the Fixed-time Sliding surface adaptively using reinforcement learning for coupled rendezvous and docking maneuver of chaser satellite with the target satellite in an unknown space environment. The neural network model is used to determine the optimal gains of reaching law of the fixed-time sliding surface. We have assumed that we don't have an accurate model of the system so we have added noise in the tangent space instead of directly on the manifold to preserve the geometric structure of the system while ensuring mathematically consistent uncertainty propagation. The reinforcement learning is used as an approximator to represent the value function of the agent to estimate the dynamical model of the system using the Actor-Critic method. The proposed control algorithm integrates a neural network and a sliding mode controller in a cascade loop architecture, where the tracking error dynamically tunes the sliding surface gains. Global fixed-time stability of the closed-loop feedback system is proved within the Lyapunov framework. This comprehensive approach of fixed-time sliding mode controller using a Reinforcement Learning based ensures the completion of the mission efficiently while addressing the critical challenges posed by the uncertain environment. The simulation results presented support the claims made.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variable Stiffness for Robust Locomotion through Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09436v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement-learned locomotion enables legged robots to perform highly dynamic motions but often accompanies time-consuming manual tuning of joint stiffness. This paper introduces a novel control paradigm that integrates variable stiffness into the action space alongside joint positions, enabling grouped stiffness control such as per-joint stiffness (PJS), per-leg stiffness (PLS) and hybrid joint-leg stiffness (HJLS). We show that variable stiffness policies, with grouping in per-leg stiffness (PLS), outperform position-based control in velocity tracking and push recovery. In contrast, HJLS excels in energy efficiency. Furthermore, our method showcases robust walking behaviour on diverse outdoor terrains by sim-to-real transfer, although the policy is sorely trained on a flat floor. Our approach simplifies design by eliminating per-joint stiffness tuning while keeping competitive results with various metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IFAC Joint Symposia on Mechatronics & Robotics</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce Sable, a performant, memory efficient and scalable sequence modeling approach to MARL. Sable works by adapting the retention mechanism in Retentive Networks to achieve computationally efficient processing of multi-agent observations with long context memory for temporal reasoning. Through extensive evaluations across six diverse environments, we demonstrate how Sable is able to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in a large number of diverse tasks (34 out of 45 tested). Furthermore, Sable maintains performance as we scale the number of agents, handling environments with more than a thousand agents while exhibiting a linear increase in memory usage. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to isolate the source of Sable's performance gains and confirm its efficient computational memory usage.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods implement perception using occupancy grid mapping (OGM), segmenting the environment into discretized cells with probabilistic information. This classical approach is well-established and provides a structured input for downstream processes like goal finding and path planning algorithms. Recent approaches leverage a biologically inspired mathematical framework known as vector symbolic architectures (VSA), commonly known as hyperdimensional computing, to perform probabilistic OGM in hyperdimensional space. This approach, VSA-OGM, provides native compatibility with spiking neural networks, positioning VSA-OGM as a potential neuromorphic alternative to conventional OGM. However, for large-scale integration, it is essential to assess the performance implications of VSA-OGM on downstream tasks compared to established OGM methods. This study examines the efficacy of VSA-OGM against a traditional OGM approach, Bayesian Hilbert Maps (BHM), within reinforcement learning based goal finding and path planning frameworks, across a controlled exploration environment and an autonomous driving scenario inspired by the F1-Tenth challenge. Our results demonstrate that VSA-OGM maintains comparable learning performance across single and multi-scenario training configurations while improving performance on unseen environments by approximately 47%. These findings highlight the increased generalizability of policy networks trained with VSA-OGM over BHM, reinforcing its potential for real-world deployment in diverse environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

| **[Revisiting Topological Interference Management: A Learning-to-Code on Graphs Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09344v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advance of topological interference management (TIM) has been one of the driving forces of recent developments in network information theory. However, state-of-the-art coding schemes for TIM are usually handcrafted for specific families of network topologies, relying critically on experts' domain knowledge and sophisticated treatments. The lack of systematic and automatic generation of solutions inevitably restricts their potential wider applications to wireless communication systems, due to the limited generalizability of coding schemes to wider network configurations. To address such an issue, this work makes the first attempt to advocate revisiting topological interference alignment (IA) from a novel learning-to-code perspective. Specifically, we recast the one-to-one and subspace IA conditions as vector assignment policies and propose a unifying learning-to-code on graphs (LCG) framework by leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) for capturing topological structures and reinforcement learning (RL) for decision-making of IA beamforming vector assignment. Interestingly, the proposed LCG framework is capable of recovering known one-to-one scalar/vector IA solutions for a significantly wider range of network topologies, and more remarkably of discovering new subspace IA coding schemes for multiple-antenna cases that are challenging to be handcrafted. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the LCG framework is an effective way to automatically produce systematic coding solutions to the TIM instances with arbitrary network topologies, and at the same time, the underlying learning algorithm is efficient with respect to online inference time and possesses excellent generalizability and transferability for practical deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2305.07186</p></details> |

We introduce hard- and soft-enforced convexity as two different approaches, and compare their performance against standard DRL on two well-known POMDP environments, namely the Tiger and FieldVisionRockSample problems. Our findings show that including the convexity feature can substantially increase performance of the agents, as well as increase robustness over the hyperparameter space, especially when testing on out-of-distribution domains.

| **[Statistical Inference for Temporal Difference Learning with Linear Function Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16106v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Statistical inference with finite-sample validity for the value function of a given policy in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is crucial for ensuring the reliability of reinforcement learning. Temporal Difference (TD) learning, arguably the most widely used algorithm for policy evaluation, serves as a natural framework for this purpose. In this paper, we study the consistency properties of TD learning with Polyak-Ruppert averaging and linear function approximation, and obtain three significant improvements over existing results. First, we derive a novel sharp high-dimensional probability convergence guarantee that depends explicitly on the asymptotic variance and holds under weak conditions. We further establish refined high-dimensional Berry-Esseen bounds over the class of convex sets that guarantee faster rates than those in the literature. Finally, we propose a plug-in estimator for the asymptotic covariance matrix, designed for efficient online computation. These results enable the construction of confidence regions and simultaneous confidence intervals for the linear parameters of the value function, with guaranteed finite-sample coverage. We demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

Tasks such as insertion with different objects or cloth hanging require precise control and effective modelling of complex dynamics. In this work, we frame this problem through the lens of a heterogeneous graph that comprises smaller sub-graphs, such as actuators and objects, accompanied by different edge types describing their interactions. This graph representation serves as a unified structure for both rigid and deformable objects tasks, and can be extended further to tasks comprising multiple actuators. To evaluate this setup, we present a novel and challenging reinforcement learning benchmark, including rigid insertion of diverse objects, as well as rope and cloth manipulation with multiple end-effectors. These tasks present a large search space, as both the initial and target configurations are uniformly sampled in 3D space. To address this issue, we propose a novel graph-based policy model, dubbed Heterogeneous Equivariant Policy (HEPi), utilizing $SE(3)$ equivariant message passing networks as the main backbone to exploit the geometric symmetry. In addition, by modeling explicit heterogeneity, HEPi can outperform Transformer-based and non-heterogeneous equivariant policies in terms of average returns, sample efficiency, and generalization to unseen objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

This paper presents a framework for achieving autonomous excavation using reinforcement learning (RL) through a rock excavation simulator. In the simulation, resolution can be defined by the particle size/number in the whole soil space. Fine-resolution simulations closely mimic real-world behavior but demand significant calculation time and challenging sample collection, while coarse-resolution simulations enable faster sample collection but deviate from real-world behavior. To combine the advantages of both resolutions, we explore using policies developed in coarse-resolution simulations for pre-training in fine-resolution simulations. To this end, we propose a novel policy learning framework called Progressive-Resolution Policy Distillation (PRPD), which progressively transfers policies through some middle-resolution simulations with conservative policy transfer to avoid domain gaps that could lead to policy transfer failure. Validation in a rock excavation simulator and nine real-world rock environments demonstrated that PRPD reduced sampling time to less than 1/7 while maintaining task success rates comparable to those achieved through policy learning in a fine-resolution simulation.</p></details> |  |

The high number of degrees of freedom to control mirrors, lenses, or phases of light makes automatic control challenging, especially when the complexity of the system cannot be adequately modeled due to noise or non-linearities. Here, we show that reinforcement learning (RL) can overcome these challenges when coupling laser light into an optical fiber, using a model-free RL approach that trains directly on the experiment without pre-training. By utilizing the sample-efficient algorithms Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) or Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), our agent learns to couple with 90% efficiency, comparable to the human expert.

| **[Logical Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09100v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of advanced reasoning models like OpenAI o3 and DeepSeek-R1, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities. However, their ability to perform rigorous logical reasoning remains an open question. This survey synthesizes recent advancements in logical reasoning within LLMs, a critical area of AI research. It outlines the scope of logical reasoning in LLMs, its theoretical foundations, and the benchmarks used to evaluate reasoning proficiency. We analyze existing capabilities across different reasoning paradigms - deductive, inductive, abductive, and analogical - and assess strategies to enhance reasoning performance, including data-centric tuning, reinforcement learning, decoding strategies, and neuro-symbolic approaches. The review concludes with future directions, emphasizing the need for further exploration to strengthen logical reasoning in AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Evolved Universal Transformer Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13166v4)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior methods propose to offset the escalating costs of modern foundation models by dropping specific parts of their contexts with hand-designed rules, while attempting to preserve their original performance. We overcome this trade-off with Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs), introducing a learned network for memory management that improves both the performance and efficiency of transformers. We evolve NAMMs atop pre-trained transformers to provide different latent contexts focusing on the most relevant information for individual layers and attention heads. NAMMs are universally applicable to any model using self-attention as they condition exclusively on the values in the produced attention matrices. Learning NAMMs on a small set of problems, we achieve substantial performance improvements across multiple long-context benchmarks while cutting the model's input contexts up to a fraction of the original sizes. We show the generality of our conditioning enables zero-shot transfer of NAMMs trained only on language to entirely new transformer architectures even across input modalities, with their benefits carrying over to vision and reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025.

While this is conceptually simple and appealing, it is not clear how to automatically learn representations that enable this sort of compositionality. We show that learning to associate the representations of current and future states with a temporal alignment loss can improve compositional generalization, even in the absence of any explicit subtask planning or reinforcement learning. We evaluate our approach across diverse robotic manipulation tasks as well as in simulation, showing substantial improvements for tasks specified with either language or goal images.</p></details> |  |

A reasoning model is a relatively new type of generative model built on top of large language models (LLMs). A reasoning model generates a long chain of thought before arriving at a final answer, an approach found to improve performance on complex tasks. However, details on developing such a model are limited, especially for reasoning models that can generate traces in a low-resource language. Typhoon T1 presents an open effort that dives into the details of developing a reasoning model in a more cost-effective way by leveraging supervised fine-tuning using open datasets, instead of reinforcement learning. This paper shares the details about synthetic data generation and training, as well as our dataset and model weights. Additionally, we provide insights gained from developing a reasoning model that generalizes across domains and is capable of generating reasoning traces in a low-resource language, using Thai as an example. We hope this open effort provides a foundation for further research in this field.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

Specifically, UAVs collect and relay data between sensor nodes (SNs) and the remote base station (BS). However, flight delays increase the AoI and degrade the network performance. To mitigate this, we adopt distributed beamforming to extend the communication range, reduce the flight frequency and ensure the continuous data relay and efficient energy utilization. Then, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize AoI and UAV energy consumption, by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectories and communication schedules. The problem is non-convex and with high dynamic, and thus we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm to solve the problem, thereby enhancing the stability and accelerate convergence speed. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm effectively addresses the problem and outperforms other benchmark algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, ICC2025</p></details> |

However, most existing methods are task-specific, requiring retraining for new tasks, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a task-efficient multi-task offline MARL algorithm, Skill-Discovery Conservative Q-Learning (SD-CQL). Unlike existing offline skill-discovery methods, SD-CQL discovers skills by reconstructing the next observation. It then evaluates fixed and variable actions separately and employs behavior-regularized conservative Q-learning to execute the optimal action for each skill. This approach eliminates the need for local-global alignment and enables strong multi-task generalization from limited small-scale source tasks. Substantial experiments on StarCraftII demonstrates the superior generalization performance and task-efficiency of SD-CQL. It achieves the best performance on $\textbf{10}$ out of $14$ task sets, with up to $\textbf{65%}$ improvement on individual task sets, and is within $4\%$ of the best baseline on the remaining four.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tackling Data Corruption in Offline Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04285v3)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning policy from offline datasets through offline reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for scaling data-driven decision-making while avoiding unsafe and costly online interactions. However, real-world data collected from sensors or humans often contains noise and errors, posing a significant challenge for existing offline RL methods, particularly when the real-world data is limited. Our study reveals that prior research focusing on adapting predominant offline RL methods based on temporal difference learning still falls short under data corruption when the dataset is limited. In contrast, we discover that vanilla sequence modeling methods, such as Decision Transformer, exhibit robustness against data corruption, even without specialized modifications. To unlock the full potential of sequence modeling, we propose Robust Decision Rransformer (RDT) by incorporating three simple yet effective robust techniques: embedding dropout to improve the model's robustness against erroneous inputs, Gaussian weighted learning to mitigate the effects of corrupted labels, and iterative data correction to eliminate corrupted data from the source. Extensive experiments on MuJoCo, Kitchen, and Adroit tasks demonstrate RDT's superior performance under various data corruption scenarios compared to prior methods. Furthermore, RDT exhibits remarkable robustness in a more challenging setting that combines training-time data corruption with test-time observation perturbations. These results highlight the potential of sequence modeling for learning from noisy or corrupted offline datasets, thereby promoting the reliable application of offline RL in real-world scenarios.

In the first part, we comprehensively examine the fundamental properties of their model-based deterministic counterparts, including projected value iteration, gradient descent algorithms, which can be viewed as prototype deterministic algorithms whose analysis plays a pivotal role in understanding and developing their model-free reinforcement learning counterparts. In particular, we prove that these algorithms converge to meaningful solutions when $n$ is sufficiently large. Based on these findings, in the second part, two $n$-step TD-learning algorithms are proposed and analyzed, which can be seen as the model-free reinforcement learning counterparts of the model-based deterministic algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2402.15781</p></details> |

In light of recent results of the magnetic mirror descent algorithm, we hypothesize that simpler generic policy gradient methods like PPO are competitive with or superior to these FP, DO, and CFR-based DRL approaches. To facilitate the resolution of this hypothesis, we implement and release the first broadly accessible exact exploitability computations for four large games. Using these games, we conduct the largest-ever exploitability comparison of DRL algorithms for imperfect-information games. Over 5600 training runs, FP, DO, and CFR-based approaches fail to outperform generic policy gradient methods.

However, these complex algorithms can inadvertently deliver problematic content related to self-harm, mental health, and eating disorders. We introduce AutoLike, a framework to audit recommendation systems in social media platforms for topics of interest and their sentiments. To automate the process, we formulate the problem as a reinforcement learning problem. AutoLike drives the recommendation system to serve a particular type of content through interactions (e.g., liking). We apply the AutoLike framework to the TikTok platform as a case study. We evaluate how well AutoLike identifies TikTok content automatically across nine topics of interest; and conduct eight experiments to demonstrate how well it drives TikTok's recommendation system towards particular topics and sentiments. AutoLike has the potential to assist regulators in auditing recommendation systems for problematic content.

To address this issue, this study proposes a method that combines topic modeling, expert knowledge inputs, and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the detection of technological changes. The method has four main steps: (1) Build a relevant topic model, starting with textual data like documents and reports to find key themes. (2) Create aspect-based topic models. Experts use curated keywords to build models that showcase key domain-specific aspects. (3) Iterative analysis and RL driven refinement: We examine metrics such as topic magnitude, similarity, entropy shifts, and how models change over time. We optimize topic selection with RL. Our reward function balances the diversity and similarity of the topics. (4) Synthesis and operational integration: Each iteration provides insights. In the final phase, the experts check these insights and reach new conclusions. These conclusions are designed for use in the firm's operational processes. The application is tested by forecasting trends in quantum communication. Results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in identifying, ranking, and tracking trends that align with expert input, providing a robust tool for exploring evolving technological landscapes.

| **[Interactive Symbolic Regression through Offline Reinforcement Learning: A Co-Design Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05306v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic Regression (SR) holds great potential for uncovering underlying mathematical and physical relationships from observed data. However, the vast combinatorial space of possible expressions poses significant challenges for both online search methods and pre-trained transformer models. Additionally, current state-of-the-art approaches typically do not consider the integration of domain experts' prior knowledge and do not support iterative interactions with the model during the equation discovery process. To address these challenges, we propose the Symbolic Q-network (Sym-Q), an advanced interactive framework for large-scale symbolic regression. Unlike previous large-scale transformer-based SR approaches, Sym-Q leverages reinforcement learning without relying on a transformer-based decoder. This formulation allows the agent to learn through offline reinforcement learning using any type of tree encoder, enabling more efficient training and inference. Furthermore, we propose a co-design mechanism, where the reinforcement learning-based Sym-Q facilitates effective interaction with domain experts at any stage of the equation discovery process. Users can dynamically modify generated nodes of the expression, collaborating with the agent to tailor the mathematical expression to best fit the problem and align with the assumed physical laws, particularly when there is prior partial knowledge of the expected behavior. Our experiments demonstrate that the pre-trained Sym-Q surpasses existing SR algorithms on the challenging SSDNC benchmark. Moreover, we experimentally show on real-world cases that its performance can be further enhanced by the interactive co-design mechanism, with Sym-Q achieving greater performance gains than other state-of-the-art models.

This survey focuses on data-driven tabular data optimization, specifically exploring reinforcement learning (RL) and generative approaches for feature selection and feature generation as fundamental techniques for refining data spaces. Feature selection aims to identify and retain the most informative attributes, while feature generation constructs new features to better capture complex data patterns. We systematically review existing generative methods for tabular data engineering, analyzing their latest advancements, real-world applications, and respective strengths and limitations. This survey emphasizes how RL-based and generative techniques contribute to the automation and intelligence of feature engineering.

However, optimizing UAV placement in dynamic and obstacle-prone environments remains a research challenge. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be an effective approach that offers adaptability and robustness in such environments. This paper introduces RLpos-3, a novel framework that integrates standard RL techniques and existing libraries with Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) to facilitate the development and evaluation of UAV positioning algorithms. RLpos-3 serves as a complementary tool for researchers, enabling the implementation, analysis, and benchmarking of UAV positioning strategies across different environmental settings while ensuring user traffic demands are met. To validate its effectiveness, we present a use case demonstrating the performance of RLpos-3 in optimizing UAV placement under realistic conditions.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Iterative Keypoint Reward (IKER), a visually grounded, Python-based reward function that serves as a dynamic task specification. Our framework leverages VLMs to generate and refine these reward functions for multi-step manipulation tasks. Given RGB-D observations and free-form language instructions, we sample keypoints in the scene and generate a reward function conditioned on these keypoints. IKER operates on the spatial relationships between keypoints, leveraging commonsense priors about the desired behaviors, and enabling precise SE(3) control. We reconstruct real-world scenes in simulation and use the generated rewards to train reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are then deployed into the real world-forming a real-to-sim-to-real loop. Our approach demonstrates notable capabilities across diverse scenarios, including both prehensile and non-prehensile tasks, showcasing multi-step task execution, spontaneous error recovery, and on-the-fly strategy adjustments. The results highlight IKER's effectiveness in enabling robots to perform multi-step tasks in dynamic environments through iterative reward shaping.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA ...</summary><p>ICRA 2025, Project Page: https://iker-robot.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Necessary and Sufficient Oracles: Toward a Computational Taxonomy For Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08632v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithms for reinforcement learning (RL) in large state spaces crucially rely on supervised learning subroutines to estimate objects such as value functions or transition probabilities. Since only the simplest supervised learning problems can be solved provably and efficiently, practical performance of an RL algorithm depends on which of these supervised learning "oracles" it assumes access to (and how they are implemented). But which oracles are better or worse? Is there a minimal oracle? In this work, we clarify the impact of the choice of supervised learning oracle on the computational complexity of RL, as quantified by the oracle strength. First, for the task of reward-free exploration in Block MDPs in the standard episodic access model -- a ubiquitous setting for RL with function approximation -- we identify two-context regression as a minimal oracle, i.e. an oracle that is both necessary and sufficient (under a mild regularity assumption). Second, we identify one-context regression as a near-minimal oracle in the stronger reset access model, establishing a provable computational benefit of resets in the process. Third, we broaden our focus to Low-Rank MDPs, where we give cryptographic evidence that the analogous oracle from the Block MDP setting is insufficient.</p></details> | 84 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Efficient IAM Greybox Penetration Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14540v7)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an access control service in cloud platforms. To securely manage cloud resources, customers need to configure IAM to specify the access control rules for their cloud organizations. However, misconfigured IAM can lead to privilege escalation (PE) attacks, causing significant economic loss. Third-party cloud security services detect such issues using whitebox penetration testing, which requires full access to IAM configurations. However, since these configurations often contain sensitive data, customers must manually anonymize them to protect their privacy. To address the dual challenges of anonymization and data privacy, we introduce TAC, the first greybox penetration testing approach for third-party services to efficiently detect IAM PEs. Instead of requiring customers to blindly anonymize their entire IAM configuration, TAC intelligently interacts with customers by querying only a small fraction of information in the IAM configuration that is necessary for PE detection. To achieve this, TAC integrates two key innovations: (1) a comprehensive IAM modeling approach to detect a wide range of IAM PEs using partial information collected from query responses, and (2) a query optimization mechanism leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to minimize customer inputs. Additionally, to address the scarcity of real-world IAM PE datasets, we introduce IAMVulGen, a synthesizer that generates a large number of diverse IAM PEs that mimic real-world scenarios. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that TAC, as a greybox approach, achieves competitively low and, in some cases, significantly lower false negative rates than state-ofthe-art whitebox approaches, while utilizing a limited number of queries.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches are either limited to simulations that overlook hardware constraints or rely on predefined ground-specific motion trajectories, failing to enable standing up across postures in real-world scenes. To bridge this gap, we present HoST (Humanoid Standing-up Control), a reinforcement learning framework that learns standing-up control from scratch, enabling robust sim-to-real transfer across diverse postures. HoST effectively learns posture-adaptive motions by leveraging a multi-critic architecture and curriculum-based training on diverse simulated terrains. To ensure successful real-world deployment, we constrain the motion with smoothness regularization and implicit motion speed bound to alleviate oscillatory and violent motions on physical hardware, respectively. After simulation-based training, the learned control policies are directly deployed on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Our experimental results demonstrate that the controllers achieve smooth, stable, and robust standing-up motions across a wide range of laboratory and outdoor environments.

In a single-agent setting the problem has been extensively studied and mostly understood. A popular approach cast the task-agnostic objective as maximizing the entropy of the state distribution induced by the agent's policy, from which principles and methods follows. In contrast, little is known about task-agnostic exploration in multi-agent settings, which are ubiquitous in the real world. How should different agents explore in the presence of others? In this paper, we address this question through a generalization to multiple agents of the problem of maximizing the state distribution entropy. First, we investigate alternative formulations, highlighting respective positives and negatives. Then, we present a scalable, decentralized, trust-region policy search algorithm to address the problem in practical settings. Finally, we provide proof of concept experiments to both corroborate the theoretical findings and pave the way for task-agnostic exploration in challenging multi-agent settings.</p></details> |  |

However, during the global partition phase, misclusterings within subgraphs have a tendency to progressively compound throughout the multi-step decoding process of the learning-based partition policy. This suboptimal behavior in the global partition phase, in turn, may lead to a dramatic deterioration in the performance of the overall decomposition-based system, despite using optimal local constructions. To address these challenges, we propose a versatile Hierarchical Learning-based Graph Partition (HLGP) framework, which is tailored to benefit the partition of CVRP instances by synergistically integrating global and local partition policies. Specifically, the global partition policy is tasked with creating the coarse multi-way partition to generate the sequence of simpler two-way partition subtasks. These subtasks mark the initiation of the subsequent K local partition levels. At each local partition level, subtasks exclusive for this level are assigned to the local partition policy which benefits from the insensitive local topological features to incrementally alleviate the compounded errors. This framework is versatile in the sense that it optimizes the involved partition policies towards a unified objective harmoniously compatible with both reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised learning (SL).

Explainable Data Valuation and Metric Adaption for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08685v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User behavior records serve as the foundation for recommender systems. While the behavior data exhibits ease of acquisition, it often suffers from varying quality. Current methods employ data valuation to discern high-quality data from low-quality data. However, they tend to employ black-box design, lacking transparency and interpretability. Besides, they are typically tailored to specific evaluation metrics, leading to limited generality across various tasks. To overcome these issues, we propose an explainable and versatile framework DVR which can enhance the efficiency of data utilization tailored to any requirements of the model architectures and evaluation metrics. For explainable data valuation, a data valuator is presented to evaluate the data quality via calculating its Shapley value from the game-theoretic perspective, ensuring robust mathematical properties and reliability. In order to accommodate various evaluation metrics, including differentiable and non-differentiable ones, a metric adapter is devised based on reinforcement learning, where a metric is treated as the reinforcement reward that guides model optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmarks verify that our framework can improve the performance of current recommendation algorithms on various metrics including ranking accuracy, diversity, and fairness. Specifically, our framework achieves up to 34.7\% improvements over existing methods in terms of representative NDCG metric. The code is available at https://github.com/renqii/DVR.</p></details> |  |

| **[Salience-Invariant Consistent Policy Learning for Generalization in Visual Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08336v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizing policies to unseen scenarios remains a critical challenge in visual reinforcement learning, where agents often overfit to the specific visual observations of the training environment. In unseen environments, distracting pixels may lead agents to extract representations containing task-irrelevant information. As a result, agents may deviate from the optimal behaviors learned during training, thereby hindering visual generalization.To address this issue, we propose the Salience-Invariant Consistent Policy Learning (SCPL) algorithm, an efficient framework for zero-shot generalization. Our approach introduces a novel value consistency module alongside a dynamics module to effectively capture task-relevant representations. The value consistency module, guided by saliency, ensures the agent focuses on task-relevant pixels in both original and perturbed observations, while the dynamics module uses augmented data to help the encoder capture dynamic- and reward-relevant representations. Additionally, our theoretical analysis highlights the importance of policy consistency for generalization. To strengthen this, we introduce a policy consistency module with a KL divergence constraint to maintain consistent policies across original and perturbed observations.Extensive experiments on the DMC-GB, Robotic Manipulation, and CARLA benchmarks demonstrate that SCPL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalization. Notably, SCPL achieves average performance improvements of 14\%, 39\%, and 69\% in the challenging DMC video hard setting, the Robotic hard setting, and the CARLA benchmark, respectively.Project Page: https://sites.google.com/view/scpl-rl.</p></details> |  |

Our algorithm, called Noise-conditioned Energy-based Annealed Rewards (NEAR), constructs several perturbed versions of the expert's motion data distribution and learns smooth, and well-defined representations of the data distribution's energy function using denoising score matching. We propose to use these learnt energy functions as reward functions to learn imitation policies via reinforcement learning. We also present a strategy to gradually switch between the learnt energy functions, ensuring that the learnt rewards are always well-defined in the manifold of policy-generated samples. We evaluate our algorithm on complex humanoid tasks such as locomotion and martial arts and compare it with state-only adversarial imitation learning algorithms like Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP). Our framework sidesteps the optimisation challenges of adversarial imitation learning techniques and produces results comparable to AMP in several quantitative metrics across multiple imitation settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025.

The recent series of Learning To Run a Power Network (L2RPN) competitions have encouraged the use of artificial agents to assist human dispatchers in operating power grids. However, the combinatorial nature of the action space poses a challenge to both conventional optimizers and learned controllers. Action space factorization, which breaks down decision-making into smaller sub-tasks, is one approach to tackle the curse of dimensionality. In this study, we propose a centrally coordinated multi-agent (CCMA) architecture for action space factorization. In this approach, regional agents propose actions and subsequently a coordinating agent selects the final action. We investigate several implementations of the CCMA architecture, and benchmark in different experimental settings against various L2RPN baseline approaches. The CCMA architecture exhibits higher sample efficiency and superior final performance than the baseline approaches. The results suggest high potential of the CCMA approach for further application in higher-dimensional L2RPN as well as real-world power grid settings.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces and analyzes overthinking in LRMs. A phenomenon where models favor extended internal reasoning chains over environmental interaction. Through experiments on software engineering tasks using SWE Bench Verified, we observe three recurring patterns: Analysis Paralysis, Rogue Actions, and Premature Disengagement. We propose a framework to study these behaviors, which correlates with human expert assessments, and analyze 4018 trajectories. We observe that higher overthinking scores correlate with decreased performance, with reasoning models exhibiting stronger tendencies toward overthinking compared to non-reasoning models. Our analysis reveals that simple efforts to mitigate overthinking in agentic environments, such as selecting the solution with the lower overthinking score, can improve model performance by almost 30% while reducing computational costs by 43%. These results suggest that mitigating overthinking has strong practical implications. We suggest that by leveraging native function-calling capabilities and selective reinforcement learning overthinking tendencies could be mitigated. We also open-source our evaluation framework and dataset to facilitate research in this direction at https://github.com/AlexCuadron/Overthinking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback via Information-Directed Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05434v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), a critical problem in training large language models, from a theoretical perspective. Our main contribution is the design of novel sample-efficient RLHF algorithms based on information-directed sampling (IDS), an online decision-making principle inspired by information theory. Our algorithms maximize the sum of the value function and a mutual information term that encourages exploration of the unknown environment (which quantifies the information gained about the environment through observed human feedback data). To tackle the challenge of large state spaces and improve sample efficiency, we construct a simplified \emph{surrogate environment} and introduce a novel distance measure (named the \emph{$\ell_g$-distance}), enabling our IDS-based algorithm to achieve a Bayesian regret upper bound of order $O(H^{\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{\log(K(\epsilon)) T})$, where $H$ is the episode length, $T$ is the number of episode and $K(\epsilon)$ is related to the covering number of the environment. Specializing to the tabular settings, this regret bound is of order $\tilde{O}(H^2\sqrt{SAT})$, where $S$ and $A$ are the numbers of states and actions. Finally, we propose an Approximate-IDS algorithm that is computationally more efficient while maintaining nearly the same sample efficiency. The design principle of this approximate algorithm is not only effective in RLHF settings but also applicable to the standard RL framework. Moreover, our work showcases the value of information theory in reinforcement learning and in the training of large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Soft Diffusion Actor-Critic: Efficient Online Reinforcement Learning for Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00361v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies have achieved superior performance in imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their rich expressiveness. However, the vanilla diffusion training procedure requires samples from target distribution, which is impossible in online RL since we cannot sample from the optimal policy, making training diffusion policies highly non-trivial in online RL. Backpropagating policy gradient through the diffusion process incurs huge computational costs and instability, thus being expensive and impractical. To enable efficient diffusion policy training for online RL, we propose Soft Diffusion Actor-Critic (SDAC), exploiting the viewpoint of diffusion models as noise-perturbed energy-based models. The proposed SDAC relies solely on the state-action value function as the energy functions to train diffusion policies, bypassing sampling from the optimal policy while maintaining lightweight computations. We conducted comprehensive comparisons on MuJoCo benchmarks. The empirical results show that SDAC outperforms all recent diffusion-policy online RLs on most tasks, and improves more than 120% over soft actor-critic on complex locomotion tasks such as Humanoid and Ant.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |

In this paper, we investigate the problem of robotic manipulation under limited visual observation and propose a task-driven asynchronous active vision-action model.Our model serially connects a camera Next-Best-View (NBV) policy with a gripper Next-Best Pose (NBP) policy, and trains them in a sensor-motor coordination framework using few-shot reinforcement learning. This approach allows the agent to adjust a third-person camera to actively observe the environment based on the task goal, and subsequently infer the appropriate manipulation actions.We trained and evaluated our model on 8 viewpoint-constrained tasks in RLBench. The results demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms baseline algorithms, showcasing its effectiveness in handling visual constraints in manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we comprehensively evaluate 16 powerful reasoning and general LLMs on three complex financial tasks involving financial text, tabular data, and equations, assessing numerical reasoning, tabular interpretation, financial terminology comprehension, long-context processing, and equation-based problem solving. Our results show that while better datasets and pretraining improve financial reasoning, general enhancements like CoT fine-tuning do not always yield consistent gains. Moreover, all reasoning strategies face challenges in improving performance on long-context and multi-table tasks. To address these limitations, we develop a financial reasoning-enhanced model based on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, by CoT fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with domain-specific reasoning paths. Even with simple fine-tuning with one financial dataset, our model achieves a consistent 10% performance improvement across tasks, surpassing all 8B models and even Llama3-70B-Instruct and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct on average. Our results highlight the need for domain-specific adaptations in financial tasks, emphasizing future directions such as multi-table reasoning, long-context processing, and financial terminology comprehension. All our datasets, models, and codes are publicly available. Furthermore, we introduce a leaderboard for benchmarking future datasets and models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work, 13 pages, 2 figures, 3 Tables</p></details> |

While FRL has advantages, its decentralized design makes it prone to poisoning attacks. To mitigate this, Byzantine-robust aggregation techniques tailored for FRL have been introduced. Yet, in our work, we reveal that these current Byzantine-robust techniques are not immune to our newly introduced Normalized attack. Distinct from previous attacks that targeted enlarging the distance of policy updates before and after an attack, our Normalized attack emphasizes on maximizing the angle of deviation between these updates. To counter these threats, we develop an ensemble FRL approach that is provably secure against both known and our newly proposed attacks. Our ensemble method involves training multiple global policies, where each is learnt by a group of agents using any foundational aggregation rule. These well-trained global policies then individually predict the action for a specific test state. The ultimate action is chosen based on a majority vote for discrete action systems or the geometric median for continuous ones. Our experimental results across different settings show that the Normalized attack can greatly disrupt non-ensemble Byzantine-robust methods, and our ensemble approach offers substantial resistance against poisoning attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in The Web Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[Generative AI-Enhanced Cooperative MEC of UAVs and Ground Stations for Unmanned Surface Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08119v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing deployment of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) require computational support and coverage in applications such as maritime search and rescue. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can offer low-cost, flexible aerial services, and ground stations (GSs) can provide powerful supports, which can cooperate to help the USVs in complex scenarios. However, the collaboration between UAVs and GSs for USVs faces challenges of task uncertainties, USVs trajectory uncertainties, heterogeneities, and limited computational resources. To address these issues, we propose a cooperative UAV and GS based robust multi-access edge computing framework to assist USVs in completing computational tasks. Specifically, we formulate the optimization problem of joint task offloading and UAV trajectory to minimize the total execution time, which is in the form of mixed integer nonlinear programming and NP-hard to tackle. Therefore, we propose the algorithm of generative artificial intelligence-enhanced heterogeneous agent proximal policy optimization (GAI-HAPPO). The proposed algorithm integrates GAI models to enhance the actor network ability to model complex environments and extract high-level features, thereby allowing the algorithm to predict uncertainties and adapt to dynamic conditions. Additionally, GAI stabilizes the critic network, addressing the instability of multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing benchmark methods, thus highlighting the potentials in tackling intricate, cross-domain issues in the considered scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Policy Evaluation Uncovers Policies of Generative Flow Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02213v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) is a probabilistic framework in which an agent learns a stochastic policy and flow functions to sample objects with probability proportional to an unnormalized reward function. GFlowNets share a strong connection with reinforcement learning (RL) that typically aims to maximize reward. A number of recent works explored connections between GFlowNets and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) RL, which incorporates entropy regularization into the standard RL objective. However, the relationship between GFlowNets and standard RL remains largely unexplored, despite the inherent similarities in their sequential decision-making nature. While GFlowNets can discover diverse solutions through specialized flow-matching objectives, connecting them to standard RL can simplify their implementation through well-established RL principles and also improve RL's capabilities in diverse solution discovery (a critical requirement in many real-world applications), and bridging this gap can further unlock the potential of both fields. In this paper, we bridge this gap by revealing a fundamental connection between GFlowNets and one of the most basic components of RL -- policy evaluation. Surprisingly, we find that the value function obtained from evaluating a uniform policy is closely associated with the flow functions in GFlowNets. Building upon these insights, we introduce a rectified random policy evaluation (RPE) algorithm, which achieves the same reward-matching effect as GFlowNets based on simply evaluating a fixed random policy, offering a new perspective. Empirical results across extensive benchmarks demonstrate that RPE achieves competitive results compared to previous approaches, shedding light on the previously overlooked connection between (non-MaxEnt) RL and GFlowNets.</p></details> |  |

Traditional robot manipulation approaches struggle with the complexity of non-prehensile or bimanual strategies commonly used by humans in these circumstances. State-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods are unsuitable due to the inherent complexity of the task. In contrast, learning from demonstration requires collecting a significant number of expert demonstrations, which is often infeasible. Instead, inspired by human bimanual manipulation strategies, where two hands coordinate to stabilise and reorient objects, we focus on a bimanual robotic setup to tackle this challenge. In particular, we introduce Constraint-based Manipulation for Bimanual Occluded Grasping (COMBO-Grasp), a learning-based approach which leverages two coordinated policies: a constraint policy trained using self-supervised datasets to generate stabilising poses and a grasping policy trained using RL that reorients and grasps the target object. A key contribution lies in value function-guided policy coordination. Specifically, during RL training for the grasping policy, the constraint policy's output is refined through gradients from a jointly trained value function, improving bimanual coordination and task performance. Lastly, COMBO-Grasp employs teacher-student policy distillation to effectively deploy point cloud-based policies in real-world environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that COMBO-Grasp significantly improves task success rates compared to competitive baseline approaches, with successful generalisation to unseen objects in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |

Designing effective reward functions for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in this domain remains a critical bottleneck, demanding extensive manual effort, domain expertise, and iterative refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce STRIDE, a novel framework built on agentic engineering to automate reward design, DRL training, and feedback optimization for humanoid robot locomotion tasks. By combining the structured principles of agentic engineering with large language models (LLMs) for code-writing, zero-shot generation, and in-context optimization, STRIDE generates, evaluates, and iteratively refines reward functions without relying on task-specific prompts or templates. Across diverse environments featuring humanoid robot morphologies, STRIDE outperforms the state-of-the-art reward design framework EUREKA, achieving an average improvement of round 250% in efficiency and task performance. Using STRIDE-generated rewards, simulated humanoid robots achieve sprint-level locomotion across complex terrains, highlighting its ability to advance DRL workflows and humanoid robotics research.</p></details> |  |

However, increasing network heterogeneity challenges general-purpose BWE algorithms, necessitating solutions that adapt to end-user environments. While widely adopted, heuristic-based methods are difficult to individualize without extensive domain expertise. Conversely, online reinforcement learning (RL) offers ease of customization but neglects prior domain expertise and suffers from sample inefficiency. Thus, we present Merlin, an imitation learning-based solution that replaces the manual parameter tuning of heuristic-based methods with data-driven updates to streamline end-user personalization. Our key insight is that transforming heuristic-based BWE algorithms into neural networks facilitates data-driven personalization. Merlin utilizes Behavioral Cloning to efficiently learn from offline telemetry logs, capturing heuristic policies without live network interactions. The cloned policy can then be seamlessly tailored to end user network conditions through online finetuning. In real intercontinental videoconferencing calls, Merlin matches our heuristic's policy with no statistically significant differences in user quality of experience (QoE). Finetuning Merlin's control policy to end-user environments enables QoE improvements of up to 7.8% compared to the heuristic policy. Lastly, our IL-based design performs competitively with current state-of-the-art online RL techniques but converges with 80% fewer videoconferencing samples, facilitating practical end-user personalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, under review.

A standard framework is to use off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods to evaluate and select the policies, but OPE either incurs exponential variance (e.g., importance sampling) or has hyperparameters on their own (e.g., FQE and model-based). In this work we focus on hyperparameter tuning for OPE itself, which is even more under-investigated. Concretely, we select among candidate value functions ("model-free") or dynamics ("model-based") to best assess the performance of a target policy. Our contributions are two fold. We develop: (1) new model-free and model-based selectors with theoretical guarantees, and (2) a new experimental protocol for empirically evaluating them. Compared to the model-free protocol in prior works, our new protocol allows for more stable generation of candidate value functions, better control of misspecification, and evaluation of model-free and model-based methods alike. We exemplify the protocol on a Gym environment, and find that our new model-free selector, LSTD-Tournament, demonstrates promising empirical performance.</p></details> |  |

However, simulations that capture the full range of spatio-temporal scales described by such PDEs are often prohibitively expensive. Consequently, coarse-grained simulations are usually deployed that adopt various heuristics and empirical closure terms to account for the missing information. We propose a novel and systematic approach for identifying closures in under-resolved PDEs using grid-based Reinforcement Learning. This formulation incorporates inductive bias and exploits locality by deploying a central policy represented efficiently by a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN). We demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of our framework through numerical solutions of the advection equation and the Burgers' equation. Our results show accurate predictions for in- and out-of-distribution test cases as well as a significant speedup compared to resolving all scales.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Parsimony and Learning (CPAL)</p></details> |

However, they struggle with learning inefficiencies in tackling real-world complex sequential decision-making tasks, especially with sparse reward signals and long-horizon dependencies. To effectively address the issue, we introduce Variational Subgoal-Conditioned RL (VSC-RL), which reformulates the vision-language sequential decision-making task as a variational goal-conditioned RL problem, allowing us to leverage advanced optimization methods to enhance learning efficiency. Specifically, VSC-RL optimizes the SubGoal Evidence Lower BOund (SGC-ELBO), which consists of (a) maximizing the subgoal-conditioned return via RL and (b) minimizing the subgoal-conditioned difference with the reference policy. We theoretically demonstrate that SGC-ELBO is equivalent to the original optimization objective, ensuring improved learning efficiency without sacrificing performance guarantees. Additionally, for real-world complex decision-making tasks, VSC-RL leverages the vision-language model to autonomously decompose the goal into feasible subgoals, enabling efficient learning. Across various benchmarks, including challenging real-world mobile device control tasks, VSC-RL significantly outperforms the SOTA vision-language agents, achieving superior performance and remarkable improvement in learning efficiency.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, offline RL leverages extensive pre-collected data to learn policies, but often produces suboptimal results due to limited data coverage. Recent efforts have sought to integrate offline and online RL in order to harness the advantages of both approaches. However, effectively combining online and offline RL remains challenging due to issues that include catastrophic forgetting, lack of robustness and sample efficiency. In an effort to address these challenges, we introduce A3 RL , a novel method that actively selects data from combined online and offline sources to optimize policy improvement. We provide theoretical guarantee that validates the effectiveness our active sampling strategy and conduct thorough empirical experiments showing that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art online RL techniques that utilize offline data.

LLMs often generate generalized responses that lack the logical specificity required for expert legal advice and are prone to hallucination, providing answers that appear correct but are unreliable. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques offer partial solutions to address this challenge, but existing approaches typically focus only on semantic similarity, neglecting the logical structure essential to legal reasoning. In this paper, we propose the Logical-Semantic Integration Model (LSIM), a novel supervised framework that bridges semantic and logical coherence. LSIM comprises three components: reinforcement learning predicts a structured fact-rule chain for each question, a trainable Deep Structured Semantic Model (DSSM) retrieves the most relevant candidate questions by integrating semantic and logical features, and in-context learning generates the final answer using the retrieved content. Our experiments on a real-world legal QA dataset-validated through both automated metrics and human evaluation-demonstrate that LSIM significantly enhances accuracy and reliability compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Our primary contribution is the design of a polynomial time $(0,\epsilon)$-additive bicriteria approximation algorithm for finding optimal constrained policies across a broad class of recursively computable constraints, including almost-sure, chance, expectation, and their anytime variants. Matching lower bounds imply our approximation guarantees are optimal so long as $P \neq NP$. The generality of our approach results in answers to several long-standing open complexity questions in the constrained reinforcement learning literature. Specifically, we are the first to prove polynomial-time approximability for the following settings: policies under chance constraints, deterministic policies under multiple expectation constraints, policies under non-homogeneous constraints (i.e., constraints of different types), and policies under constraints for continuous-state processes.</p></details> |  |

Despite their superior performance, current RLHF approaches often require a large amount of human-labelled preference data, which is expensive to collect. In this paper, inspired by the success of active learning, we address this problem by proposing query-efficient RLHF methods. We first formalize the alignment problem as a contextual dueling bandit problem and design an active-query-based proximal policy optimization (APPO) algorithm with an $\tilde{O}(d^2/\Delta)$ instance-dependent regret bound and an $\tilde{O}(d^2/\Delta^2)$ query complexity, where $d$ is the dimension of feature space and $\Delta$ is the sub-optimality gap over all the contexts. We then propose ADPO, a practical version of our algorithm based on direct preference optimization (DPO) and apply it to fine-tuning LLMs. Our experiments show that ADPO, while only making about half of queries for human preference, matches the performance of the state-of-the-art DPO method.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 1 figure, 4 table</p></details> |

However, the diminishing returns of this approach necessitate alternative methods to improve model capabilities, particularly in tasks requiring advanced reasoning. Large reasoning models, which leverage long chain-of-thoughts, bring unprecedented breakthroughs in problem-solving capabilities but at a substantial deployment cost associated to longer generations. Reducing inference costs is crucial for the economic feasibility, user experience, and environmental sustainability of these models. In this work, we propose to train large reasoning models to reason efficiently. More precisely, we use reinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning models to dynamically allocate inference-time compute based on task complexity. Our method incentivizes models to minimize unnecessary computational overhead while maintaining accuracy, thereby achieving substantial efficiency gains. It enables the derivation of a family of reasoning models with varying efficiency levels, controlled via a single hyperparameter. Experiments on two open-weight large reasoning models demonstrate significant reductions in inference cost while preserving most of the accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, when a sudden change to world mechanics or properties occurs then agent performance and reliability can dramatically decline. We refer to the sudden change in visual properties or state transitions as novelties. Implementing novelty detection within generated world model frameworks is a crucial task for protecting the agent when deployed. In this paper, we propose straightforward bounding approaches to incorporate novelty detection into world model RL agents, by utilizing the misalignment of the world model's hallucinated states and the true observed states as an anomaly score. We provide effective approaches to detecting novelties in a distribution of transitions learned by an agent in a world model. Finally, we show the advantage of our work in a novel environment compared to traditional machine learning novelty detection methods as well as currently accepted RL focused novelty detection algorithms.</p></details> | RLC Safety 2024 |
| **[DPO Meets PPO: Reinforced Token Optimization for RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18922v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the classical Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) framework, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is employed to learn from sparse, sentence-level rewards -- a challenging scenario in traditional deep reinforcement learning. Despite the great successes of PPO in the alignment of large language models, its open-source implementation is still largely sub-optimal. To address these issues, we introduce a framework that models RLHF problems as a Markov decision process (MDP), enabling the capture of fine-grained token-wise information. Under this framework, we introduce an algorithm Reinforced Token Optimization (\texttt{RTO}), which learns the token-wise reward function from preference data and performs policy optimization based on this learned token-wise reward signal. Theoretically, \texttt{RTO} is proven to have the capability of finding the near-optimal policy sample-efficiently. For its practical implementation, \texttt{RTO} innovatively integrates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and PPO. DPO, originally derived from sparse sentence rewards, surprisingly provides us with a token-wise characterization of response quality, which is seamlessly incorporated into our subsequent PPO training stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{RTO} performs better than PPO and other direct preference learning algorithms. In particular, RTO outperforms PPO by 7.5 points on the AlpacaEval 2 benchmark and by 4.1 points on Arena-Hard. Our code and models are available at \href{https://github.com/zkshan2002/RTO}{https://github.com/zkshan2002/RTO}.</p></details> |  |

While tabular and linear models have been thoroughly explored, the analytical study of RL under nonlinear function approximation, especially kernel-based models, has recently gained traction for their strong representational capacity and theoretical tractability. In this context, we examine the question of statistical efficiency in kernel-based RL within the reward-free RL framework, specifically asking: how many samples are required to design a near-optimal policy? Existing work addresses this question under restrictive assumptions about the class of kernel functions. We first explore this question by assuming a generative model, then relax this assumption at the cost of increasing the sample complexity by a factor of H, the length of the episode. We tackle this fundamental problem using a broad class of kernels and a simpler algorithm compared to prior work. Our approach derives new confidence intervals for kernel ridge regression, specific to our RL setting, which may be of broader applicability. We further validate our theoretical findings through simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AISTATS 2025</p></details> |

Learning-based approaches, particularly reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL), require realistic simulation environments for efficient data collection. However, current platforms often include only relatively simple, non-dexterous manipulations and lack the flexibility required for effective learning and generalization. We introduce SurgicAI, a novel platform for development and benchmarking addressing these challenges by providing the flexibility to accommodate both modular subtasks and more importantly task decomposition in RL-based surgical robotics. Compatible with the da Vinci Surgical System, SurgicAI offers a standardized pipeline for collecting and utilizing expert demonstrations. It supports deployment of multiple RL and IL approaches, and the training of both singular and compositional subtasks in suturing scenarios, featuring high dexterity and modularization. Meanwhile, SurgicAI sets clear metrics and benchmarks for the assessment of learned policies. We implemented and evaluated multiple RL and IL algorithms on SurgicAI. Our detailed benchmark analysis underscores SurgicAI's potential to advance policy learning in surgical robotics. Details: https://github.com/surgical-robotics-ai/SurgicAI</p></details> |  |

To deploy LLMs as AI assistants, it is crucial that these models exhibit desirable behavioral traits, such as non-toxicity and resilience against jailbreak attempts. Current approaches for detoxification or preventing jailbreaking usually involve Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which requires finetuning billions of parameters through gradient descent with substantial computational cost. Furthermore, models modified through SFT and RLHF may deviate from the pretrained models, potentially leading to a degradation in foundational LLM capabilities. In this paper, we observe that surprisingly, directly editing a small subset of parameters can effectively modulate specific behaviors of LLMs, such as detoxification and resistance to jailbreaking, with only inference-level computational resources. Experiments demonstrate that in the detoxification task, our approach achieves reductions of up to 90.0% in toxicity on the RealToxicityPrompts dataset and 49.2% on ToxiGen, while maintaining the LLM's general capabilities in areas such as common sense, question answering, and mathematics</p></details> | 23 pages, 14 figures |

We propose distributed value decomposition networks (DVDN) that generate a joint Q-function that factorizes into agent-wise Q-functions. Whereas the original value decomposition networks rely on centralized training, our approach is suitable for domains where centralized training is not possible and agents must learn by interacting with the physical environment in a decentralized manner while communicating with their peers. DVDN overcomes the need for centralized training by locally estimating the shared objective. We contribute with two innovative algorithms, DVDN and DVDN (GT), for the heterogeneous and homogeneous agents settings respectively. Empirically, both algorithms approximate the performance of value decomposition networks, in spite of the information loss during communication, as demonstrated in ten MARL tasks in three standard environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 15 figures, to be published in Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2025), Detroit, Michigan, USA, May 19 - 23, 2025, IFAAMAS</p></details> |

We propose Nonepisodic Optimistic RL (NeoRL), an approach based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty. NeoRL uses well-calibrated probabilistic models and plans optimistically w.r.t. the epistemic uncertainty about the unknown dynamics. Under continuity and bounded energy assumptions on the system, we provide a first-of-its-kind regret bound of $O(\Gamma_T \sqrt{T})$ for general nonlinear systems with Gaussian process dynamics. We compare NeoRL to other baselines on several deep RL environments and empirically demonstrate that NeoRL achieves the optimal average cost while incurring the least regret.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning with Batch and Weight Normalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07523v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has achieved significant milestones, but sample efficiency remains a bottleneck for real-world applications. Recently, CrossQ has demonstrated state-of-the-art sample efficiency with a low update-to-data (UTD) ratio of 1. In this work, we explore CrossQ's scaling behavior with higher UTD ratios. We identify challenges in the training dynamics, which are emphasized by higher UTD ratios. To address these, we integrate weight normalization into the CrossQ framework, a solution that stabilizes training, has been shown to prevent potential loss of plasticity and keeps the effective learning rate constant. Our proposed approach reliably scales with increasing UTD ratios, achieving competitive performance across 25 challenging continuous control tasks on the DeepMind Control Suite and Myosuite benchmarks, notably the complex dog and humanoid environments. This work eliminates the need for drastic interventions, such as network resets, and offers a simple yet robust pathway for improving sample efficiency and scalability in model-free reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAPF-GPT: Imitation Learning for Multi-Agent Pathfinding at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00134v4)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a problem that generally requires finding collision-free paths for multiple agents in a shared environment. Solving MAPF optimally, even under restrictive assumptions, is NP-hard, yet efficient solutions for this problem are critical for numerous applications, such as automated warehouses and transportation systems. Recently, learning-based approaches to MAPF have gained attention, particularly those leveraging deep reinforcement learning. Typically, such learning-based MAPF solvers are augmented with additional components like single-agent planning or communication. Orthogonally, in this work we rely solely on imitation learning that leverages a large dataset of expert MAPF solutions and transformer-based neural network to create a foundation model for MAPF called MAPF-GPT. The latter is capable of generating actions without additional heuristics or communication. MAPF-GPT demonstrates zero-shot learning abilities when solving the MAPF problems that are not present in the training dataset. We show that MAPF-GPT notably outperforms the current best-performing learnable MAPF solvers on a diverse range of problem instances and is computationally efficient during inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mind the Gap: Towards Generalizable Autonomous Penetration Testing via Domain Randomization and Meta-Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04078v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With increasing numbers of vulnerabilities exposed on the internet, autonomous penetration testing (pentesting) has emerged as a promising research area. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for studying this topic. However, two key challenges limit the applicability of RL-based autonomous pentesting in real-world scenarios: (a) training environment dilemma -- training agents in simulated environments is sample-efficient while ensuring their realism remains challenging; (b) poor generalization ability -- agents' policies often perform poorly when transferred to unseen scenarios, with even slight changes potentially causing significant generalization gap. To this end, we propose GAP, a generalizable autonomous pentesting framework that aims to realizes efficient policy training in realistic environments and train generalizable agents capable of drawing inferences about other cases from one instance. GAP introduces a Real-to-Sim-to-Real pipeline that (a) enables end-to-end policy learning in unknown real environments while constructing realistic simulations; (b) improves agents' generalization ability by leveraging domain randomization and meta-RL learning.Specially, we are among the first to apply domain randomization in autonomous pentesting and propose a large language model-powered domain randomization method for synthetic environment generation. We further apply meta-RL to improve agents' generalization ability in unseen environments by leveraging synthetic environments. The combination of two methods effectively bridges the generalization gap and improves agents' policy adaptation performance.Experiments are conducted on various vulnerable virtual machines, with results showing that GAP can enable policy learning in various realistic environments, achieve zero-shot policy transfer in similar environments, and realize rapid policy adaptation in dissimilar environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logarithmic Regret for Online KL-Regularized Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07460v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have shown that KL-regularization plays a pivotal role in improving the efficiency of RL fine-tuning for large language models (LLMs). Despite its empirical advantage, the theoretical difference between KL-regularized RL and standard RL remains largely under-explored. While there is a recent line of work on the theoretical analysis of KL-regularized objective in decision making \citep{xiong2024iterative, xie2024exploratory,zhao2024sharp}, these analyses either reduce to the traditional RL setting or rely on strong coverage assumptions. In this paper, we propose an optimism-based KL-regularized online contextual bandit algorithm, and provide a novel analysis of its regret. By carefully leveraging the benign optimization landscape induced by the KL-regularization and the optimistic reward estimation, our algorithm achieves an $\mathcal{O}\big(\eta\log (N_{\mathcal R} T)\cdot d_{\mathcal R}\big)$ logarithmic regret bound, where $\eta, N_{\mathcal R},T,d_{\mathcal R}$ denote the KL-regularization parameter, the cardinality of the reward function class, number of rounds, and the complexity of the reward function class. Furthermore, we extend our algorithm and analysis to reinforcement learning by developing a novel decomposition over transition steps and also obtain a similar logarithmic regret bound.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharp Analysis for KL-Regularized Contextual Bandits and RLHF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04625v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reverse-Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization has emerged to be a predominant technique used to enhance policy optimization in reinforcement learning (RL) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which forces the learned policy to stay close to a reference policy. While the effectiveness and necessity of KL-regularization have been empirically demonstrated in various practical scenarios, current theoretical analysis of KL-regularized RLHF still obtains the same $\mathcal{O}(1 / \epsilon^2)$ sample complexity as problems without KL-regularization. To understand the fundamental distinction between policy learning objectives with KL-regularization and ones without KL-regularization, we are the first to theoretically demonstrate the power of KL-regularization by providing a sharp analysis for KL-regularized contextual bandits and RLHF, revealing an $\mathcal{O}(1 / \epsilon)$ sample complexity when $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. We further explore the role of data coverage in contextual bandits and RLHF. While the coverage assumption is commonly employed in offline RLHF to link the samples from the reference policy to the optimal policy, often at the cost of a multiplicative dependence on the coverage coefficient, its impact on the sample complexity of online RLHF remains unclear. Previous theoretical analyses of online RLHF typically require explicit exploration and additional structural assumptions on the reward function class. In contrast, we show that with sufficient coverage from the reference policy, a simple two-stage mixed sampling strategy can achieve a sample complexity with only an additive dependence on the coverage coefficient. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the roles of KL-regularization and data coverage in RLHF, shedding light on the design of more efficient RLHF algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards bandit-based prompt-tuning for in-the-wild foundation agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06358v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting has emerged as the dominant paradigm for adapting large, pre-trained transformer-based models to downstream tasks. The Prompting Decision Transformer (PDT) enables large-scale, multi-task offline reinforcement learning pre-training by leveraging stochastic trajectory prompts to identify the target task. However, these prompts are sampled uniformly from expert demonstrations, overlooking a critical limitation: Not all prompts are equally informative for differentiating between tasks. To address this, we propose an inference time bandit-based prompt-tuning framework that explores and optimizes trajectory prompt selection to enhance task performance. Our experiments indicate not only clear performance gains due to bandit-based prompt-tuning, but also better sample complexity, scalability, and prompt space exploration compared to prompt-tuning baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Formal Theory of the Need for Competence via Computational Intrinsic Motivation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07423v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational models offer powerful tools for formalising psychological theories, making them both testable and applicable in digital contexts. However, they remain little used in the study of motivation within psychology. We focus on the "need for competence", postulated as a key basic human need within Self-Determination Theory (SDT) -- arguably the most influential psychological framework for studying intrinsic motivation (IM). The need for competence is treated as a single construct across SDT texts. Yet, recent research has identified multiple, ambiguously defined facets of competence in SDT. We propose that these inconsistencies may be alleviated by drawing on computational models from the field of artificial intelligence, specifically from the domain of reinforcement learning (RL). By aligning the aforementioned facets of competence -- effectance, skill use, task performance, and capacity growth -- with existing RL formalisms, we provide a foundation for advancing competence-related theory in SDT and motivational psychology more broadly. The formalisms reveal underlying preconditions that SDT fails to make explicit, demonstrating how computational models can improve our understanding of IM. Additionally, our work can support a cycle of theory development by inspiring new computational models formalising aspects of the theory, which can then be tested empirically to refine the theory. While our research lays a promising foundation, empirical studies of these models in both humans and machines are needed, inviting collaboration across disciplines.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages excluding references</p></details> |

The notion of optimality is fundamental to design suitable adaptive procedures of the proposal density within Monte Carlo schemes. This work is an exhaustive review around the concept of optimality in importance sampling. Several frameworks are described and analyzed, such as the marginal likelihood approximation for model selection, the use of multiple proposal densities, a sequence of tempered posteriors, and noisy scenarios including the applications to approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and reinforcement learning, to name a few. Some theoretical and empirical comparisons are also provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[UAV-assisted Joint Mobile Edge Computing and Data Collection via Matching-enabled Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07388v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) and data collection (DC) have been popular research issues. Different from existing works that consider MEC and DC scenarios separately, this paper investigates a multi-UAV-assisted joint MEC-DC system. Specifically, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the MEC latency and maximize the collected data volume. This problem can be classified as a non-convex mixed integer programming problem that exhibits long-term optimization and dynamics. Thus, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based approach that jointly optimizes the UAV movement, user transmit power, and user association in real time to solve the problem efficiently. Specifically, we reformulate the optimization problem into an action space-reduced Markov decision process (MDP) and optimize the user association by using a two-phase matching-based association (TMA) strategy. Subsequently, we propose a soft actor-critic (SAC)-based approach that integrates the proposed TMA strategy (SAC-TMA) to solve the formulated joint optimization problem collaboratively. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SAC-TMA is able to coordinate the two subsystems and can effectively reduce the system latency and improve the data collection volume compared with other benchmark algorithms.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |
| **[AURO: Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive User Retention Optimization in Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03984v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of Reinforcement Learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention for its ability of optimizing user retention in recommender systems. A primary obstacle in this optimization process is the environment non-stationarity stemming from the continual and complex evolution of user behavior patterns over time, such as variations in interaction rates and retention propensities. These changes pose significant challenges to existing RL algorithms for recommendations, leading to issues with dynamics and reward distribution shifts. This paper introduces a novel approach called \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{U}ser \textbf{R}etention \textbf{O}ptimization (AURO) to address this challenge. To navigate the recommendation policy in non-stationary environments, AURO introduces an state abstraction module in the policy network. The module is trained with a new value-based loss function, aligning its output with the estimated performance of the current policy. As the policy performance of RL is sensitive to environment drifts, the loss function enables the state abstraction to be reflective of environment changes and notify the recommendation policy to adapt accordingly. Additionally, the non-stationarity of the environment introduces the problem of implicit cold start, where the recommendation policy continuously interacts with users displaying novel behavior patterns. AURO encourages exploration guarded by performance-based rejection sampling to maintain a stable recommendation quality in the cost-sensitive online environment. Extensive empirical analysis are conducted in a user retention simulator, the MovieLens dataset, and a live short-video recommendation platform, demonstrating AURO's superior performance against all evaluated baseline algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>The W...</summary><p>The Web Conference 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

Current benchmark-based methods often rely on static and costly datasets, are misaligned with practical user needs, and lack flexibility across domains. To address these limitations, we revisit the evaluation process and introduce two key concepts: Benchmark+, which extends the traditional question-answer benchmark into a more flexible ``strategy-criterion'' format; and Assessment+, which enhances the interaction process, enabling deeper exploration and supporting analysis from broader perspectives. We propose TestAgent, an agent-based evaluation framework that implements these concepts using retrieval-augmented generation and reinforcement learning. TestAgent enables automatic dynamic benchmark generation and in-depth assessment across diverse vertical domain scenarios. Experiments on tasks ranging from constructing multiple vertical domain evaluations to converting static benchmarks into dynamic forms demonstrate the effectiveness of TestAgent. This work offers an interesting perspective on automatic evaluation for LLMs and highlights a pathway for dynamic and domain-adaptive assessments.</p></details> |  |

However, unlike most fields where DRL is widely used, the stock market is more volatile and dynamic as it is affected by several factors such as global events and investor sentiment. Therefore, it remains a challenge to construct a DRL-based portfolio management framework with strong return capability, stable training, and generalization ability. This study introduces a new framework utilizing the Memory Instance Gated Transformer (MIGT) for effective portfolio management. By incorporating a novel Gated Instance Attention module, which combines a transformer variant, instance normalization, and a Lite Gate Unit, our approach aims to maximize investment returns while ensuring the learning process's stability and reducing outlier impacts. Tested on the Dow Jones Industrial Average 30, our framework's performance is evaluated against fifteen other strategies using key financial metrics like the cumulative return and risk-return ratios (Sharpe, Sortino, and Omega ratios). The results highlight MIGT's advantage, showcasing at least a 9.75% improvement in cumulative returns and a minimum 2.36% increase in risk-return ratios over competing strategies, marking a significant advancement in DRL for portfolio management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploratory Diffusion Policy for Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07279v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) aims to pre-train agents by exploring states or skills in reward-free environments, facilitating the adaptation to downstream tasks. However, existing methods often overlook the fitting ability of pre-trained policies and struggle to handle the heterogeneous pre-training data, which are crucial for achieving efficient exploration and fast fine-tuning. To address this gap, we propose Exploratory Diffusion Policy (EDP), which leverages the strong expressive ability of diffusion models to fit the explored data, both boosting exploration and obtaining an efficient initialization for downstream tasks. Specifically, we estimate the distribution of collected data in the replay buffer with the diffusion policy and propose a score intrinsic reward, encouraging the agent to explore unseen states. For fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion policy on downstream tasks, we provide both theoretical analyses and practical algorithms, including an alternating method of Q function optimization and diffusion policy distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EDP in efficient exploration during pre-training and fast adaptation during fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

This research delves into the realm of drug optimization and introduce a novel reinforcement learning algorithm to finetune a drug optimization LLM-based generative model, enhancing the original drug across target objectives, while retains the beneficial chemical properties of the original drug. This work is comprised of two primary components: (1) DrugImprover: A framework tailored for improving robustness and efficiency in drug optimization. It includes a LLM designed for drug optimization and a novel Structured Policy Optimization (SPO) algorithm, which is theoretically grounded. This algorithm offers a unique perspective for fine-tuning the LLM-based generative model by aligning the improvement of the generated molecule with the input molecule under desired objectives. (2) A dataset of 1 million compounds, each with OEDOCK docking scores on 5 human proteins associated with cancer cells and 24 binding sites from SARS-CoV-2 virus.

| **[STP: Self-play LLM Theorem Provers with Iterative Conjecturing and Proving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00212v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in formal theorem proving by LLMs is the lack of high-quality training data. Although reinforcement learning or expert iteration partially mitigates this issue by alternating between LLM generating proofs and finetuning them on correctly generated ones, performance quickly plateaus due to the scarcity of correct proofs (sparse rewards). To keep improving the models with limited data, we draw inspiration from mathematicians, who continuously develop new results, partly by proposing novel conjectures or exercises (which are often variants of known results) and attempting to solve them. We design the Self-play Theorem Prover (STP) that simultaneously takes on two roles, conjecturer and prover, each providing training signals to the other. The conjecturer is trained iteratively on previously generated conjectures that are barely provable by the current prover, which incentivizes it to generate increasingly challenging conjectures over time. The prover attempts to prove the conjectures with standard expert iteration. We evaluate STP with both Lean and Isabelle formal versifiers. With 19.8 billion tokens generated during the training in Lean, STP proves 26.3% of the statements in the LeanWorkbook dataset, doubling the previous best result of 13.2% achieved through expert iteration. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance among whole-proof generation methods on miniF2F-test (61.7%, pass@3200), Proofnet-test (23.1%, pass@3200) and PutnamBench (8/644, pass@3200).</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Improve the Training Efficiency of DRL for Wireless Communication Resource Allocation: The Role of Generative Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07211v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic resource allocation in mobile wireless networks involves complex, time-varying optimization problems, motivating the adoption of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, most existing works rely on pre-trained policies, overlooking dynamic environmental changes that rapidly invalidate the policies. Periodic retraining becomes inevitable but incurs prohibitive computational costs and energy consumption-critical concerns for resource-constrained wireless systems. We identify three root causes of inefficient retraining: high-dimensional state spaces, suboptimal action spaces exploration-exploitation trade-offs, and reward design limitations. To overcome these limitations, we propose Diffusion-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (D2RL), which leverages generative diffusion models (GDMs) to holistically enhance all three DRL components. Iterative refinement process and distribution modelling of GDMs enable (1) the generation of diverse state samples to improve environmental understanding, (2) balanced action space exploration to escape local optima, and (3) the design of discriminative reward functions that better evaluate action quality. Our framework operates in two modes: Mode I leverages GDMs to explore reward spaces and design discriminative reward functions that rigorously evaluate action quality, while Mode II synthesizes diverse state samples to enhance environmental understanding and generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D2RL achieves faster convergence and reduced computational costs over conventional DRL methods for resource allocation in wireless communications while maintaining competitive policy performance. This work underscores the transformative potential of GDMs in overcoming fundamental DRL training bottlenecks for wireless networks, paving the way for practical, real-time deployments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing testbeds often focus on purely virtual simulations or limited robot morphologies such as robotic arms, quadrupeds, and humanoids, leaving high-mobility platforms with real-world physical constraints like drones underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present VolleyBots, a new MARL testbed where multiple drones cooperate and compete in the sport of volleyball under physical dynamics. VolleyBots features a turn-based interaction model under volleyball rules, a hierarchical decision-making process that combines motion control and strategic play, and a high-fidelity simulation for seamless sim-to-real transfer. We provide a comprehensive suite of tasks ranging from single-drone drills to multi-drone cooperative and competitive tasks, accompanied by baseline evaluations of representative MARL and game-theoretic algorithms. Results in simulation show that while existing algorithms handle simple tasks effectively, they encounter difficulty in complex tasks that require both low-level control and high-level strategy. We further demonstrate zero-shot deployment of a simulation-learned policy to real-world drones, highlighting VolleyBots' potential to propel MARL research involving agile robotic platforms.

While recent advancements have provided valuable insights into various stages and settings of RLHF, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the entire RLHF pipeline remains lacking. Towards this end, we propose a unified framework for the RLHF pipeline from the view of contextual bandits and provide provable efficiency guarantees. In particular, we decompose the RLHF process into two distinct stages: (post-)training and deployment, exploring both passive and active data collection strategies during the training phase. By employing the Bradley-Terry preference model with a linearly parameterized reward function, we reformulate RLHF as a contextual preference bandit problem. We then develop novel algorithms for each stage, demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches in both statistical and computational efficiency. Finally, we apply our method to train and deploy Llama-3-8B-Instruct on the Ultrafeedback-binarized dataset, and empirical results confirm the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Multi-Step Reasoning Abilities of Language Models through Direct Q-Function Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09302v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a crucial role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences and improving their ability to perform complex tasks. However, current approaches either require significant computational resources due to the use of multiple models and extensive online sampling for training (e.g., PPO) or are framed as bandit problems (e.g., DPO, DRO), which often struggle with multi-step reasoning tasks, such as math problem solving and complex reasoning that involve long chains of thought. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Direct Q-function Optimization (DQO), which formulates the response generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilizes the soft actor-critic (SAC) framework to optimize a Q-function directly parameterized by the language model. The MDP formulation of DQO offers structural advantages over bandit-based methods, enabling more effective process supervision. Experimental results on two math problem-solving datasets, GSM8K and MATH, demonstrate that DQO outperforms previous methods, establishing it as a promising offline reinforcement learning approach for aligning language models.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, current state-of-the-art approaches typically do not consider the integration of domain experts' prior knowledge and do not support iterative interactions with the model during the equation discovery process. To address these challenges, we propose the Symbolic Q-network (Sym-Q), an advanced interactive framework for large-scale symbolic regression. Unlike previous large-scale transformer-based SR approaches, Sym-Q leverages reinforcement learning without relying on a transformer-based decoder. This formulation allows the agent to learn through offline reinforcement learning using any type of tree encoder, enabling more efficient training and inference. Furthermore, we propose a co-design mechanism, where the reinforcement learning-based Sym-Q facilitates effective interaction with domain experts at any stage of the equation discovery process. Users can dynamically modify generated nodes of the expression, collaborating with the agent to tailor the mathematical expression to best fit the problem and align with the assumed physical laws, particularly when there is prior partial knowledge of the expected behavior. Our experiments demonstrate that the pre-trained Sym-Q surpasses existing SR algorithms on the challenging SSDNC benchmark. Moreover, we experimentally show on real-world cases that its performance can be further enhanced by the interactive co-design mechanism, with Sym-Q achieving greater performance gains than other state-of-the-art models. Our reproducible code is available at https://github.com/EPFL-IMOS/Sym-Q.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work should not be a new submission but instead should be an update to my existing article, arXiv:2402.05306</p></details> |

Current neural network approaches face two main issues: challenges in scalable verification and limited interpretability. To address these, we propose an end-to-end framework using transformers to construct analytical Lyapunov functions (local), which simplifies formal verification, enhances interpretability, and provides valuable insights for control engineers. Our framework consists of a transformer-based trainer that generates candidate Lyapunov functions and a falsifier that verifies candidate expressions and refines the model via risk-seeking policy gradient. Unlike Alfarano et al. (2024), which utilizes pre-training and seeks global Lyapunov functions for low-dimensional systems, our model is trained from scratch via reinforcement learning (RL) and succeeds in finding local Lyapunov functions for high-dimensional and non-polynomial systems. Given the analytical nature of the candidates, we employ efficient optimization methods for falsification during training and formal verification tools for the final verification. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on a range of nonlinear dynamical systems with up to ten dimensions and show that it can discover Lyapunov functions not previously identified in the control literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages (8+18), preprint for discussion.

| **[Cross-platform Learning-based Fault Tolerant Surfacing Controller for Underwater Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07133v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel cross-platform fault-tolerant surfacing controller for underwater robots, based on reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike conventional approaches, which require explicit identification of malfunctioning actuators, our method allows the robot to surface using only the remaining operational actuators without needing to pinpoint the failures. The proposed controller learns a robust policy capable of handling diverse failure scenarios across different actuator configurations. Moreover, we introduce a transfer learning mechanism that shares a part of the control policy across various underwater robots with different actuators, thus improving learning efficiency and generalization across platforms. To validate our approach, we conduct simulations on three different types of underwater robots: a hovering-type AUV, a torpedo shaped AUV, and a turtle-shaped robot (U-CAT). Additionally, real-world experiments are performed, successfully transferring the learned policy from simulation to a physical U-CAT in a controlled environment. Our RL-based controller demonstrates superior performance in terms of stability and success rate compared to a baseline controller, achieving an 85.7 percent success rate in real-world tests compared to 57.1 percent with a baseline controller. This research provides a scalable and efficient solution for fault-tolerant control for diverse underwater platforms, with potential applications in real-world aquatic missions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2025 international Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

During the search, RT-FMT quickly looks for the global solution and, in the meantime, generates local paths that can be used by the robot to start execution faster. In addition, our algorithm constantly rewires the tree to keep branches from forming inside the dynamic obstacles and to maintain the tree root near the robot, which allows the tree to be reused multiple times for different goals. Our algorithm is based on the planners Fast Marching Tree (FMT*) and Real-time Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RT-RRT*). We show via simulations that RT-FMT outperforms RT- RRT* in both execution cost and arrival time, in most cases. Moreover, we also demonstrate via simulation that it is worthwhile taking the local path before the global path is available in order to reduce arrival time, even though there is a small possibility of taking an inferior path.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the preprint version of the paper published in 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA).

| **[Environment-Centric Learning Approach for Gait Synthesis in Terrestrial Soft Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03617v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locomotion gaits are fundamental for control of soft terrestrial robots. However, synthesis of these gaits is challenging due to modeling of robot-environment interaction and lack of a mathematical framework. This work presents an environment-centric, data-driven and fault-tolerant probabilistic Model-Free Control (pMFC) framework that allows for soft multi-limb robots to learn from their environment and synthesize diverse sets of locomotion gaits for realizing open-loop control. Here, discretization of factors dominating robot-environment interactions enables an environment-specific graphical representation where the edges encode experimental locomotion data corresponding to the robot motion primitives. In this graph, locomotion gaits are defined as simple cycles that are transformation invariant, i.e., the locomotion is independent of the starting vertex of these periodic cycles. Gait synthesis, the problem of finding optimal locomotion gaits for a given substrate, is formulated as Binary Integer Linear Programming (BILP) problems with a linearized cost function, linear constraints, and iterative simple cycle detection. Experimentally, gaits are synthesized for varying robot-environment interactions. Variables include robot morphology - three-limb and four-limb robots, TerreSoRo-III and TerreSoRo-IV; substrate - rubber mat, whiteboard and carpet; and actuator functionality - simulated loss of robot limb actuation. On an average, gait synthesis improves the translation and rotation speeds by 82% and 97% respectively. The results highlight that data-driven methods are vital to soft robot locomotion control due to the significant influence of unexpected asymmetries in the system and the dependence of optimal gait sequences on the experimental robot-environment interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO) (19 pages, 18 figures, 9 tables).

| **[Robot Pouring: Identifying Causes of Spillage and Selecting Alternative Action Parameters Using Probabilistic Actual Causation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09395v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In everyday life, we perform tasks (e.g., cooking or cleaning) that involve a large variety of objects and goals. When confronted with an unexpected or unwanted outcome, we take corrective actions and try again until achieving the desired result. The reasoning performed to identify a cause of the observed outcome and to select an appropriate corrective action is a crucial aspect of human reasoning for successful task execution. Central to this reasoning is the assumption that a factor is responsible for producing the observed outcome. In this paper, we investigate the use of probabilistic actual causation to determine whether a factor is the cause of an observed undesired outcome. Furthermore, we show how the actual causation probabilities can be used to find alternative actions to change the outcome. We apply the probabilistic actual causation analysis to a robot pouring task. When spillage occurs, the analysis indicates whether a task parameter is the cause and how it should be changed to avoid spillage. The analysis requires a causal graph of the task and the corresponding conditional probability distributions. To fulfill these requirements, we perform a complete causal modeling procedure (i.e., task analysis, definition of variables, determination of the causal graph structure, and estimation of conditional probability distributions) using data from a realistic simulation of the robot pouring task, covering a large combinatorial space of task parameters. Based on the results, we discuss the implications of the variables' representation and how the alternative actions suggested by the actual causation analysis would compare to the alternative solutions proposed by a human observer. The practical use of the analysis of probabilistic actual causation to select alternative action parameters is demonstrated.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

However, these skills are often limited to the particular action, object, and environment \textit{instances} that are shown in the training data, and have trouble transferring to other instances of the same category. In this work we present an open-vocabulary Spatial-Semantic Diffusion policy (S$^2$-Diffusion) which enables generalization from instance-level training data to category-level, enabling skills to be transferable between instances of the same category. We show that functional aspects of skills can be captured via a promptable semantic module combined with a spatial representation. We further propose leveraging depth estimation networks to allow the use of only a single RGB camera. Our approach is evaluated and compared on a diverse number of robot manipulation tasks, both in simulation and in the real world. Our results show that S$^2$-Diffusion is invariant to changes in category-irrelevant factors as well as enables satisfying performance on other instances within the same category, even if it was not trained on that specific instance. Full videos of all real-world experiments are available in the supplementary material.</p></details> |  |

The proposed system enhances emergency response teams by providing advanced mission planning, safety monitoring, and adaptive task execution capabilities. Moreover, it ensures real- time situational awareness and operational support in complex and risky situations, facilitating rapid and precise information collection and coordinated actions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Deep Inverse-Mapping Model for a Flapping Robotic Wing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09378v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In systems control, the dynamics of a system are governed by modulating its inputs to achieve a desired outcome. For example, to control the thrust of a quad-copter propeller the controller modulates its rotation rate, relying on a straightforward mapping between the input rotation rate and the resulting thrust. This mapping can be inverted to determine the rotation rate needed to generate a desired thrust. However, in complex systems, such as flapping-wing robots where intricate fluid motions are involved, mapping inputs (wing kinematics) to outcomes (aerodynamic forces) is nontrivial and inverting this mapping for real-time control is computationally impractical. Here, we report a machine-learning solution for the inverse mapping of a flapping-wing system based on data from an experimental system we have developed. Our model learns the input wing motion required to generate a desired aerodynamic force outcome. We used a sequence-to-sequence model tailored for time-series data and augmented it with a novel adaptive-spectrum layer that implements representation learning in the frequency domain. To train our model, we developed a flapping wing system that simultaneously measures the wing's aerodynamic force and its 3D motion using high-speed cameras. We demonstrate the performance of our system on an additional open-source dataset of a flapping wing in a different flow regime. Results show superior performance compared with more complex state-of-the-art transformer-based models, with 11% improvement on the test datasets median loss. Moreover, our model shows superior inference time, making it practical for onboard robotic control. Our open-source data and framework may improve modeling and real-time control of systems governed by complex dynamics, from biomimetic robots to biomedical devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025. 10 Pages 5 figures + 2 figures in appendix</p></details> |
| **[Moving Matter: Efficient Reconfiguration of Tile Arrangements by a Single Active Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09299v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of reconfiguring a two-dimensional connected grid arrangement of passive building blocks from a start configuration to a goal configuration, using a single active robot that can move on the tiles, remove individual tiles from a given location and physically move them to a new position by walking on the remaining configuration. The objective is to determine a reconfiguration schedule that minimizes the overall makespan, while ensuring that the tile configuration remains connected. We provide both negative and positive results. (1) We present a generalized version of the problem, parameterized by weighted costs for moving with or without tiles, and show that this is NP-complete. (2) We give a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm for the case of disjoint start and target bounding boxes. In addition, our approach yields optimal carry distance for 2-scaled instances.</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures |

While this is conceptually simple and appealing, it is not clear how to automatically learn representations that enable this sort of compositionality. We show that learning to associate the representations of current and future states with a temporal alignment loss can improve compositional generalization, even in the absence of any explicit subtask planning or reinforcement learning. We evaluate our approach across diverse robotic manipulation tasks as well as in simulation, showing substantial improvements for tasks specified with either language or goal images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Re$^3$Sim: Generating High-Fidelity Simulation Data via 3D-Photorealistic Real-to-Sim for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08645v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world data collection for robotics is costly and resource-intensive, requiring skilled operators and expensive hardware. Simulations offer a scalable alternative but often fail to achieve sim-to-real generalization due to geometric and visual gaps. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D-photorealistic real-to-sim system, namely, RE$^3$SIM, addressing geometric and visual sim-to-real gaps. RE$^3$SIM employs advanced 3D reconstruction and neural rendering techniques to faithfully recreate real-world scenarios, enabling real-time rendering of simulated cross-view cameras within a physics-based simulator. By utilizing privileged information to collect expert demonstrations efficiently in simulation, and train robot policies with imitation learning, we validate the effectiveness of the real-to-sim-to-real pipeline across various manipulation task scenarios. Notably, with only simulated data, we can achieve zero-shot sim-to-real transfer with an average success rate exceeding 58%. To push the limit of real-to-sim, we further generate a large-scale simulation dataset, demonstrating how a robust policy can be built from simulation data that generalizes across various objects.

While existing navigation systems could provide them with surrounding information while navigating, they have limited scalability as they require preparing prebuilt maps. Thus, to develop a map-less robot that assists blind people in exploring, we first conducted a study with ten blind participants at a shopping mall and science museum to investigate the requirements of the system, which revealed the need for three levels of detail to describe the surroundings based on users' preferences. Then, we developed WanderGuide, with functionalities that allow users to adjust the level of detail in descriptions and verbally interact with the system to ask questions about the environment or to go to points of interest. The study with five blind participants revealed that WanderGuide could provide blind people with the enjoyable experience of wandering around without a specific destination in their minds.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D-Grounded Vision-Language Framework for Robotic Task Planning: Automated Prompt Synthesis and Supervised Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08903v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in scene understanding and perception tasks, enabling robots to plan and execute actions adaptively in dynamic environments. However, most multimodal large language models lack robust 3D scene localization capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in fine-grained robotic operations. Additionally, challenges such as low recognition accuracy, inefficiency, poor transferability, and reliability hinder their use in precision tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that integrates a 2D prompt synthesis module by mapping 2D images to point clouds, and incorporates a small language model (SLM) for supervising VLM outputs. The 2D prompt synthesis module enables VLMs, trained on 2D images and text, to autonomously extract precise 3D spatial information without manual intervention, significantly enhancing 3D scene understanding. Meanwhile, the SLM supervises VLM outputs, mitigating hallucinations and ensuring reliable, executable robotic control code generation. Our framework eliminates the need for retraining in new environments, thereby improving cost efficiency and operational robustness. Experimental results that the proposed framework achieved a 96.0\% Task Success Rate (TSR), outperforming other methods. Ablation studies demonstrated the critical role of both the 2D prompt synthesis module and the output supervision module (which, when removed, caused a 67\% TSR drop). These findings validate the framework's effectiveness in improving 3D recognition, task planning, and robotic task execution.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces ROSA (Robot Operating System Agent), an AI-powered agent that bridges the gap between the Robot Operating System (ROS) and natural language interfaces. By leveraging state-of-the-art language models and integrating open-source frameworks, ROSA enables operators to interact with robots using natural language, translating commands into actions and interfacing with ROS through well-defined tools. ROSA's design is modular and extensible, offering seamless integration with both ROS1 and ROS2, along with safety mechanisms like parameter validation and constraint enforcement to ensure secure, reliable operations. While ROSA is originally designed for ROS, it can be extended to work with other robotics middle-wares to maximize compatibility across missions. ROSA enhances human-robot interaction by democratizing access to complex robotic systems, empowering users of all expertise levels with multi-modal capabilities such as speech integration and visual perception. Ethical considerations are thoroughly addressed, guided by foundational principles like Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, ensuring that AI integration promotes safety, transparency, privacy, and accountability. By making robotic technology more user-friendly and accessible, ROSA not only improves operational efficiency but also sets a new standard for responsible AI use in robotics and potentially future mission operations. This paper introduces ROSA's architecture and showcases initial mock-up operations in JPL's Mars Yard, a laboratory, and a simulation using three different robots.

We highlight key applications in diverse domains, such as household robotics, construction, formation control, target tracking, and robot games, showcasing the versatility and transformative potential of LLMs in MRS. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that limit adapting LLMs in MRS, including mathematical reasoning limitations, hallucination, latency issues, and the need for robust benchmarking systems. Finally, we outline opportunities for future research, emphasizing advancements in fine-tuning, reasoning techniques, and task-specific models.

However, current systems often separate map exploration and path planning, with exploration relying on inefficient algorithms due to limited (partially observed) environmental information. In this paper, we present a novel navigation pipeline named ''ClipRover'' for simultaneous exploration and target discovery in unknown environments, leveraging the capabilities of a vision-language model named CLIP. Our approach requires only monocular vision and operates without any prior map or knowledge about the target. For comprehensive evaluations, we design the functional prototype of a UGV (unmanned ground vehicle) system named ''Rover Master'', a customized platform for general-purpose VLN tasks. We integrate and deploy the ClipRover pipeline on Rover Master to evaluate its throughput, obstacle avoidance capability, and trajectory performance across various real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ClipRover consistently outperforms traditional map traversal algorithms and achieves performance comparable to path-planning methods that depend on prior map and target knowledge. Notably, ClipRover offers real-time active navigation without requiring pre-captured candidate images or pre-built node graphs, addressing key limitations of existing VLN pipelines.</p></details> | V1, 21 pages |

These advancements include, among others, the use of deep neural networks to represent dynamics that are partially observed by robot sensors, as well as effective control using sparse control signals. In this work, we explore a more general problem: the manipulation of acoustic waves, which are partially observed by a robot capable of influencing the waves through spatially sparse actuators. This problem holds great potential for the design of new artificial materials, ultrasonic cutting tools, energy harvesting, and other applications. We develop an efficient data-driven method for robot learning that is applicable to either focusing scattered acoustic energy in a designated region or suppressing it, depending on the desired task. The proposed method is better in terms of a solution quality and computational complexity as compared to a state-of-the-art learning based method for manipulation of dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations. Furthermore our proposed method is competitive with a classical semi-analytical method in acoustics research on the demonstrated tasks.

We introduce Iterative Keypoint Reward (IKER), a visually grounded, Python-based reward function that serves as a dynamic task specification. Our framework leverages VLMs to generate and refine these reward functions for multi-step manipulation tasks. Given RGB-D observations and free-form language instructions, we sample keypoints in the scene and generate a reward function conditioned on these keypoints. IKER operates on the spatial relationships between keypoints, leveraging commonsense priors about the desired behaviors, and enabling precise SE(3) control. We reconstruct real-world scenes in simulation and use the generated rewards to train reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are then deployed into the real world-forming a real-to-sim-to-real loop. Our approach demonstrates notable capabilities across diverse scenarios, including both prehensile and non-prehensile tasks, showcasing multi-step task execution, spontaneous error recovery, and on-the-fly strategy adjustments. The results highlight IKER's effectiveness in enabling robots to perform multi-step tasks in dynamic environments through iterative reward shaping.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA ...</summary><p>ICRA 2025, Project Page: https://iker-robot.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Robot Data Curation with Mutual Information Estimators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08623v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of imitation learning policies often hinges on the datasets with which they are trained. Consequently, investment in data collection for robotics has grown across both industrial and academic labs. However, despite the marked increase in the quantity of demonstrations collected, little work has sought to assess the quality of said data despite mounting evidence of its importance in other areas such as vision and language. In this work, we take a critical step towards addressing the data quality in robotics. Given a dataset of demonstrations, we aim to estimate the relative quality of individual demonstrations in terms of both state diversity and action predictability. To do so, we estimate the average contribution of a trajectory towards the mutual information between states and actions in the entire dataset, which precisely captures both the entropy of the state distribution and the state-conditioned entropy of actions. Though commonly used mutual information estimators require vast amounts of data often beyond the scale available in robotics, we introduce a novel technique based on k-nearest neighbor estimates of mutual information on top of simple VAE embeddings of states and actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach is able to partition demonstration datasets by quality according to human expert scores across a diverse set of benchmarks spanning simulation and real world environments. Moreover, training policies based on data filtered by our method leads to a 5-10% improvement in RoboMimic and better performance on real ALOHA and Franka setups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Videos and code at https://jhejna.github.io/demonstration-info</p></details> |

Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in defining reward signals for teaching robots manipulation skills. However, existing work often provides reward guidance that is too coarse, leading to insufficient learning processes. In this paper, we address this issue by implementing more fine-grained reward guidance. We decompose tasks into simpler sub-tasks, using this decomposition to offer more informative reward guidance with VLMs. We also propose a VLM-based self imitation learning process to speed up learning. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our algorithm consistently outperforms baselines such as CLIP, LIV, and RoboCLIP.

This study examines the effectiveness of two types of social control strategies from a social robot, relationship-focused strategies (emphasizing relational consequences) and target-focused strategies (emphasizing health consequences), in encouraging people to reduce sedentary behavior. A two-session lab experiment was conducted (n = 135), where participants first played a game with a robot, followed by the robot persuading them to stand up and move using one of the strategies. Half of the participants joined a second session to have a repeated interaction with the robot. Results showed that relationship-focused strategies motivated participants to stay active longer. Repeated sessions did not strengthen participants' relationship with the robot, but those who felt more attached to the robot responded more actively to the target-focused strategies. These findings offer valuable insights for designing persuasive strategies for social robots in health communication contexts.</p></details> | Accepted to HRI 2025 |
| **[Data Scaling Laws in Imitation Learning for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18647v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data scaling has revolutionized fields like natural language processing and computer vision, providing models with remarkable generalization capabilities. In this paper, we investigate whether similar data scaling laws exist in robotics, particularly in robotic manipulation, and whether appropriate data scaling can yield single-task robot policies that can be deployed zero-shot for any object within the same category in any environment. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on data scaling in imitation learning. By collecting data across numerous environments and objects, we study how a policy's generalization performance changes with the number of training environments, objects, and demonstrations. Throughout our research, we collect over 40,000 demonstrations and execute more than 15,000 real-world robot rollouts under a rigorous evaluation protocol. Our findings reveal several intriguing results: the generalization performance of the policy follows a roughly power-law relationship with the number of environments and objects. The diversity of environments and objects is far more important than the absolute number of demonstrations; once the number of demonstrations per environment or object reaches a certain threshold, additional demonstrations have minimal effect. Based on these insights, we propose an efficient data collection strategy. With four data collectors working for one afternoon, we collect sufficient data to enable the policies for two tasks to achieve approximately 90% success rates in novel environments with unseen objects.</p></details> |  |

Researchers have developed various computational models for continual learning (CL) that can allow robots to continually learn from limited training data, and avoid forgetting previous knowledge. While these CL models can mitigate forgetting on static, systematically collected datasets, it is unclear how human users might perceive a robot that continually learns over multiple interactions with them. In this paper, we developed a system that integrates CL models for object recognition with a Fetch mobile manipulator robot and allows human participants to directly teach and test the robot over multiple sessions. We conducted an in-person study with 60 participants that interacted with our system in 300 sessions (5 sessions per participant). We conducted a between-subject study with three different CL models to understand human perceptions of continual learning robots over multiple sessions. Our results suggest that participants' perceptions of trust, competence, and usability of a continual learning robot significantly decrease over multiple sessions if the robot forgets previously learned objects. However, the perceived task load on participants for teaching and testing the robot remains the same over multiple sessions even if the robot forgets previously learned objects. Our results also indicate that state-of-the-art CL models might perform unreliably when applied on robots interacting with human participants. Further, continual learning robots are not perceived as very trustworthy or competent by human participants, regardless of the underlying continual learning model or the session number.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the International Journal of Social Robotics (SoRo), 2025</p></details> |

The main obstacle to automation lies in the difficulty of developing a reliable robotic grasping system for already harvested trusses. We propose a method to grasp trusses that are stacked in a crate with considerable clutter, which is how they are commonly stored and transported after harvest. The method consists of a deep learning-based vision system to first identify the individual trusses in the crate and then determine a suitable grasping location on the stem. To this end, we have introduced a grasp pose ranking algorithm with online learning capabilities. After selecting the most promising grasp pose, the robot executes a pinch grasp without needing touch sensors or geometric models. Lab experiments with a robotic manipulator equipped with an eye-in-hand RGB-D camera showed a 100% clearance rate when tasked to pick all trusses from a pile. 93% of the trusses were successfully grasped on the first try, while the remaining 7% required more attempts.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

With the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), robots are now capable of generating natural language descriptions of their surroundings, aiding in safer decision-making. However, existing VLMs often struggle to accurately interpret and convey spatial relationships, which is crucial for navigation in complex environments such as street crossings. We introduce the Space-Aware Instruction Tuning (SAIT) dataset and the Space-Aware Benchmark (SA-Bench) to address the limitations of current VLMs in understanding physical environments. Our automated data generation pipeline focuses on the virtual path to the destination in 3D space and the surroundings, enhancing environmental comprehension and enabling VLMs to provide more accurate guidance to visually impaired individuals. We also propose an evaluation protocol to assess VLM effectiveness in delivering walking guidance. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our space-aware instruction-tuned model outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. We have fully open-sourced the SAIT dataset and SA-Bench, along with the related code, at https://github.com/byungokhan/Space-awareVLM</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

Interacting with such dynamic humans is challenging, as the robot needs to predict the humans accurately for safe and efficient operations. Long-term interactions with dynamic humans have not been extensively studied by prior works. We propose an adaptive human prediction model based on the Theory-of-Mind (ToM), a fundamental social-cognitive ability that enables humans to infer others' behaviours and intentions. We formulate the human internal belief about others using a game-theoretic model, which predicts the future motions of all agents in a navigation scenario. To estimate an evolving belief, we use an Unscented Kalman Filter to update the behavioural parameters in the human internal model. Our formulation provides unique interpretability to dynamic human behaviours by inferring how the human predicts the robot. We demonstrate through long-term experiments in both simulations and real-world settings that our prediction effectively promotes safety and efficiency in downstream robot planning.

In human factors and human-autonomy teaming, it is recognized that individuals navigate their environments using an internal mental simulation, or mental model. The mental model informs cognitive processes including situation awareness, contextual reasoning, and task planning. In teaming domains, the mental model includes a team model of each teammate's beliefs and capabilities, enabling fluent teamwork without the need for explicit communication. However, little work has applied team models to human-robot teaming. In this work we compare the performance of two models, logical predicates and large language models, at estimating user situation awareness over varying visibility conditions. Our results indicate that the methods are largely resilient to low-visibility conditions in our domain, however opportunities exist to improve their overall performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IROS 2024, project page located at https://github.com/gt-cec/tmm-hri</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate the problem of robotic manipulation under limited visual observation and propose a task-driven asynchronous active vision-action model.Our model serially connects a camera Next-Best-View (NBV) policy with a gripper Next-Best Pose (NBP) policy, and trains them in a sensor-motor coordination framework using few-shot reinforcement learning. This approach allows the agent to adjust a third-person camera to actively observe the environment based on the task goal, and subsequently infer the appropriate manipulation actions.We trained and evaluated our model on 8 viewpoint-constrained tasks in RLBench. The results demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms baseline algorithms, showcasing its effectiveness in handling visual constraints in manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by deploying EdgeFlowNet on a tiny quadrotor to perform static obstacle avoidance, flight through unknown gaps and dynamic obstacle dodging. EdgeFlowNet is about 20 faster than the previous state-of-the-art approaches while improving accuracy by over 20% and using only 1.08W of power enabling advanced autonomy on palm-sized tiny mobile robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://pear.wpi.edu/research/edgeflownet.html</p></details> |

Existing Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) systems relying on gestures or verbal commands are impractical for the elderly due to difficulties with complex syntax or sign language. To address the challenge, this paper introduces a multi-modal interaction framework that combines voice and deictic posture information to create a more natural HRI system. The visual cues are first processed by the object detection model to gain a global understanding of the environment, and then bounding boxes are estimated based on depth information. By using a large language model (LLM) with voice-to-text commands and temporally aligned selected bounding boxes, robot action sequences can be generated, while key control syntax constraints are applied to avoid potential LLM hallucination issues. The system is evaluated on real-world tasks with varying levels of complexity using a Universal Robots UR3e manipulator. Our method demonstrates significantly better performance in HRI in terms of accuracy and robustness. To benefit the research community and the general public, we will make our code and design open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine on 11 Feb 2025</p></details> |

Designing effective reward functions for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in this domain remains a critical bottleneck, demanding extensive manual effort, domain expertise, and iterative refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce STRIDE, a novel framework built on agentic engineering to automate reward design, DRL training, and feedback optimization for humanoid robot locomotion tasks. By combining the structured principles of agentic engineering with large language models (LLMs) for code-writing, zero-shot generation, and in-context optimization, STRIDE generates, evaluates, and iteratively refines reward functions without relying on task-specific prompts or templates. Across diverse environments featuring humanoid robot morphologies, STRIDE outperforms the state-of-the-art reward design framework EUREKA, achieving an average improvement of round 250% in efficiency and task performance. Using STRIDE-generated rewards, simulated humanoid robots achieve sprint-level locomotion across complex terrains, highlighting its ability to advance DRL workflows and humanoid robotics research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robot Instance Segmentation with Few Annotations for Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01302v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of robots to manipulate objects relies heavily on their aptitude for visual perception. In domains characterized by cluttered scenes and high object variability, most methods call for vast labeled datasets, laboriously hand-annotated, with the aim of training capable models. Once deployed, the challenge of generalizing to unfamiliar objects implies that the model must evolve alongside its domain. To address this, we propose a novel framework that combines Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) with Learning Through Interaction (LTI), allowing a model to learn by observing scene alterations and leverage visual consistency despite temporal gaps without requiring curated data of interaction sequences. As a result, our approach exploits partially annotated data through self-supervision and incorporates temporal context using pseudo-sequences generated from unlabeled still images. We validate our method on two common benchmarks, ARMBench mix-object-tote and OCID, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on ARMBench, we attain an $\text{AP}_{50}$ of $86.37$, almost a $20\%$ improvement over existing work, and obtain remarkable results in scenarios with extremely low annotation, achieving an $\text{AP}_{50}$ score of $84.89$ with just $1 \%$ of annotated data compared to $72$ presented in ARMBench on the fully annotated counterpart.</p></details> |  |

Behavior Trees (BTs) are considered one of the most prominent control-policy-defining frameworks in task planning, due to their modularity, flexibility, and reusability. Generating reliable and accurate BT-based control policies for robotic systems remains challenging and often requires domain expertise. In this paper, we present the LLM-GP-BT technique that leverages the Large Language Model (LLM) and Genetic Programming (GP) to automate the generation and configuration of BTs. The LLM-GP-BT technique processes robot task commands expressed in human natural language and converts them into accurate and reliable BT-based task plans in a computationally efficient and user-friendly manner. The proposed technique is systematically developed and validated through simulation experiments, demonstrating its potential to streamline task planning for autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Conference</p></details> |

Traditional human-robot teaming often relies on a pre-determined robot communication scheme, restricting teamwork adaptability in complex tasks. Leveraging strong communication capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a Human-Robot Teaming Framework with Multi-Modal Language feedback (HRT-ML), a framework designed to enhance human-robot interaction by adjusting the frequency and content of language-based feedback. HRT-ML framework includes two core modules: a Coordinator for high-level, low-frequency strategic guidance, and a Manager for subtask-specific, high-frequency instructions, enabling passive and active interactions with human teammates. To assess the impact of language feedback in collaborative scenarios, we conducted experiments in an enhanced Overcooked environment with varying levels of task complexity (easy, medium, hard) and feedback frequency (inactive, passive, active, superactive). Our results show that as task complexity increases relative to human capabilities, human teammates exhibited a stronger preference towards robotic agents that can offer frequent, proactive support. However, when task complexities exceed the LLM's capacity, noisy and inaccurate feedback from superactive robotic agents can instead hinder team performance, as it requires human teammates to increase their effort to interpret and respond to a large number of communications, with limited performance return. Our results offer a general principle for robotic agents to dynamically adjust their levels and frequencies of communications to work seamlessly with humans and achieve improved teaming performance.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[VIP: Vision Instructed Pre-training for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07169v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of scaling up training data in robotic manipulation is still limited. A primary challenge in manipulation is the tasks are diverse, and the trained policy would be confused if the task targets are not specified clearly. Existing works primarily rely on text instruction to describe targets. However, we reveal that current robotic data cannot train policies to understand text instruction effectively, and vision is much more comprehensible. Therefore, we introduce utilizing vision instruction to specify targets. A straightforward implementation is training a policy to predict the intermediate actions linking the current observation and a future image. Nevertheless, a single future image does not describe the task target in insufficient detail. To handle this problem, we propose to use sparse point flows to provide more detailed information. Extensive tasks are designed based on real and simulated environments to evaluate the effectiveness of our vision instructed pre-training (VIP) method. The results indicate VIP improves the performance on diverse tasks significantly, and the derived policy can complete competitive tasks like ``opening the lid of a tightly sealed bottle''.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents NeuPAN: a real-time, highly accurate, map-free, easy-to-deploy, and environment-invariant robot motion planner. Leveraging a tightly coupled perception-to-control framework, NeuPAN has two key innovations compared to existing approaches: 1) it directly maps raw point cloud data to a latent distance feature space for collision-free motion generation, avoiding error propagation from the perception to control pipeline; 2) it is interpretable from an end-to-end model-based learning perspective. The crux of NeuPAN is solving an end-to-end mathematical model with numerous point-level constraints using a plug-and-play (PnP) proximal alternating-minimization network (PAN), incorporating neurons in the loop. This allows NeuPAN to generate real-time, physically interpretable motions. It seamlessly integrates data and knowledge engines, and its network parameters can be fine-tuned via backpropagation. We evaluate NeuPAN on a ground mobile robot, a wheel-legged robot, and an autonomous vehicle, in extensive simulated and real-world environments. Results demonstrate that NeuPAN outperforms existing baselines in terms of accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and generalization capabilities across various environments, including the cluttered sandbox, office, corridor, and parking lot. We show that NeuPAN works well in unknown and unstructured environments with arbitrarily shaped objects, transforming impassable paths into passable ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TRO 2025; project website: https://hanruihua.github.io/neupan_project/</p></details> |

The difficulty of the problem arises from the extremely large search space caused by the combinatorial nature of the problem and the continuous state space. We propose a two-level approach where the low level is a sampling-based planner Safe Interval RRT* (SI-RRT*) that finds a collision-free trajectory for individual robots. The high level can use any method that can resolve inter-robot conflicts where we employ two representative methods that are Prioritized Planning (SI-CPP) and Conflict Based Search (SI-CCBS). Experimental results show that SI-RRT* can quickly find a high-quality solution with a few samples. SI-CPP exhibits improved scalability while SI-CCBS produces higher-quality solutions compared to the state-of-the-art planners for continuous space.</p></details> |  |

This letter focuses on in-grasp object movement, which refers to manipulating an object to a desired pose through only finger motions within a stable grasp. The key challenge lies in simultaneously achieving high precision and large-range movements while maintaining a constant stable grasp. To address this problem, we propose a simple and practical approach based on kinematic trajectory optimization with no need for pretraining or object geometries, which can be easily applied to novel objects in real-world scenarios. Adopting this approach, we won the championship for the in-hand manipulation track at the 9th Robotic Grasping and Manipulation Competition (RGMC) held at ICRA 2024.

Yet, gaze shifts and selective attention are critical for perceiving details and refining object boundaries. Object segmentation and gaze behavior are, however, typically treated as two independent processes. Here, we present a computational model that simulates these processes in an interconnected manner and allows for hypothesis-driven investigations of distinct attentional mechanisms. Drawing on an information processing pattern from robotics, we use a Bayesian filter to recursively segment the scene, which also provides an uncertainty estimate for the object boundaries that we use to guide active scene exploration. We demonstrate that this model closely resembles observers' free viewing behavior on a dataset of dynamic real-world scenes, measured by scanpath statistics, including foveation duration and saccade amplitude distributions used for parameter fitting and higher-level statistics not used for fitting. These include how object detections, inspections, and returns are balanced and a delay of returning saccades without an explicit implementation of such temporal inhibition of return. Extensive simulations and ablation studies show that uncertainty promotes balanced exploration and that semantic object cues are crucial to forming the perceptual units used in object-based attention. Moreover, we show how our model's modular design allows for extensions, such as incorporating saccadic momentum or pre-saccadic attention, to further align its output with human scanpaths.</p></details> | <details><summary>40+25...</summary><p>40+25 pages, 8+7 figures</p></details> |

The experiments confirm the algorithm's effectiveness in producing collision-free schedules as well as achieving the optimal solution when all tasks assigned to the robots are of equal duration. Additionally, we provide an integer linear programming formulation that guarantees an optimal solution for this scheduling problem on any input graph, at the expense of significantly greater computational resources. We prove the correctness of our integer linear program. By comparing the solutions of these two algorithms, including the time required by the schedule itself, and the run time of each algorithm, we show that the heuristic algorithm is optimal or near optimal in nearly all cases, with a far faster run time than the integer linear program.</p></details> |  |

While significant progress has been made in robotic manipulation, existing approaches often fall short in generalization to complex environmental variations and addressing memory-dependent tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAM2Act, a multi-view robotic transformer-based policy that leverages multi-resolution upsampling with visual representations from large-scale foundation model. SAM2Act achieves a state-of-the-art average success rate of 86.8% across 18 tasks in the RLBench benchmark, and demonstrates robust generalization on The Colosseum benchmark, with only a 4.3% performance gap under diverse environmental perturbations.

While several robotic platforms have been used in gerontological healthcare, the question of whether or not a social interactive robot with multi-modal conversational capabilities will be useful and accepted in real-life facilities is yet to be answered. This paper is an attempt to partially answer this question, via two waves of experiments with patients and companions in a day-care gerontological facility in Paris with a full-sized humanoid robot endowed with social and conversational interaction capabilities. The software architecture, developed during the H2020 SPRING project, together with the experimental protocol, allowed us to evaluate the acceptability (AES) and usability (SUS) with more than 60 end-users.

To realize this vision, robots must continuously learn and evolve through consistent interaction and collaboration with humans, while humans need to gradually develop an understanding of and trust in robots through shared experiences. However, training and testing algorithms directly on physical robots involve substantial costs and safety risks. Moreover, current robotic simulators fail to support real human participation, limiting their ability to provide authentic interaction experiences and gather valuable human feedback. In this paper, we introduce SymbioSim, a novel human-in-the-loop robotic simulation platform designed to enable the safe and efficient development, evaluation, and optimization of human-robot interactions.

| **[Robot Navigation in Unknown and Cluttered Workspace with Dynamical System Modulation in Starshaped Roadmap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11484v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared to conventional decomposition methods that use ellipses or polygons to represent free space, starshaped representation can better capture the natural distribution of sensor data, thereby exploiting a larger portion of traversable space. This paper introduces a novel motion planning and control framework for navigating robots in unknown and cluttered environments using a dynamically constructed starshaped roadmap. Our approach generates a starshaped representation of the surrounding free space from real-time sensor data using piece-wise polynomials. Additionally, an incremental roadmap maintaining the connectivity information is constructed, and a searching algorithm efficiently selects short-term goals on this roadmap. Importantly, this framework addresses dead-end situations with a graph updating mechanism. To ensure safe and efficient movement within the starshaped roadmap, we propose a reactive controller based on Dynamic System Modulation (DSM). This controller facilitates smooth motion within starshaped regions and their intersections, avoiding conservative and short-sighted behaviors and allowing the system to handle intricate obstacle configurations in unknown and cluttered environments. Comprehensive evaluations in both simulations and real-world experiments show that the proposed method achieves higher success rates and reduced travel times compared to other methods. It effectively manages intricate obstacle configurations, avoiding conservative and myopic behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Towards replicating this capability, we demonstrated successful leader-follower formation swimming using flow pressure sensing in our undulatory robotic fish ($\mu$Bot/MUBot). The follower $\mu$Bot is equipped at its head with bilateral pressure sensors to detect signals excited by both its own and the leader's movements. First, using experiments with static formations between an undulating leader and a stationary follower, we determined the formation that resulted in strong pressure variations measured by the follower. This formation was then selected as the desired formation in free swimming for obtaining an expert policy. Next, a long short-term memory neural network was used as the control policy that maps the pressure signals along with the robot motor commands and the Euler angles (measured by the onboard IMU) to the steering command. The policy was trained to imitate the expert policy using behavior cloning and Dataset Aggregation (DAgger). The results show that with merely two bilateral pressure sensors and less than one hour of training data, the follower effectively tracked the leader within distances of up to 200 mm (= 1 body length) while swimming at speeds of 155 mm/s (= 0.8 body lengths/s). This work highlights the potential of fish-inspired robots to effectively navigate fluid environments and achieve formation swimming through the use of flow pressure feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 10 figures.

One fundamental challenge is the lack of robotic data, which are typically obtained through expensive on-robot operation. A promising remedy is to leverage cheaper, off-domain data such as action-free videos, hand-drawn sketches or simulation data. In this work, we posit that hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) models can be more effective in utilizing off-domain data than standard monolithic VLA models that directly finetune vision-language models (VLMs) to predict actions. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA models, where the high-level VLM is finetuned to produce a coarse 2D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory given an RGB image and a task description. The intermediate 2D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Doing so alleviates the high-level VLM from fine-grained action prediction, while reducing the low-level policy's burden on complex task-level reasoning. We show that, with the hierarchical design, the high-level VLM can transfer across significant domain gaps between the off-domain finetuning data and real-robot testing scenarios, including differences on embodiments, dynamics, visual appearances and task semantics, etc. In the real-robot experiments, we observe an average of 20% improvement in success rate across seven different axes of generalization over OpenVLA, representing a 50% relative gain.

However, existing models always depend on additional datasets or extensive pre-training to maximize performance improvements, consuming abundant training time and expensive hardware cost. To tackle this issue, we present RoboBERT, a novel end-to-end robotic manipulation model integrated with a unique training strategy. This model utilizes a CNN-based diffusion policy, enhancing and stabilizing the effectiveness of this model by separating training processes for different modalities. It also underscores the importance of data augmentation, verifying various techniques to significantly boost performance. Unlike models that depend on extra data or large foundation models, RoboBERT achieves a highly competitive success rate while using only language-labeled expert demonstrations and maintaining a relatively smaller model size. Specifically, RoboBERT achieves an average length of 4.52 on the CALVIN benchmark for \(ABCD \rightarrow D\) task, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) record. Furthermore, when tested on a real robot, the model demonstrates superior performance, achieving a higher success rate than other methods trained with the same data. We propose that these concepts and methodologies of RoboBERT demonstrate extensive versatility and compatibility, contributing significantly to the development of lightweight multimodal robotic models.

For object detection and pose estimation, performance comparisons of YOLO11 (YOLO11n, YOLO11s, YOLO11m, YOLO11l and YOLO11x) and YOLOv8 (YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l and YOLOv8x) were made under identical hyperparameter settings among the all configurations. It was observed that YOLO11n surpassed all configurations of YOLO11 and YOLOv8 in terms of box precision and pose precision, achieving scores of 0.91 and 0.915, respectively. Conversely, YOLOv8n exhibited the highest box and pose recall scores of 0.905 and 0.925, respectively. Regarding the mean average precision at 50\% intersection over union (mAP@50), YOLO11s led all configurations with a box mAP@50 score of 0.94, while YOLOv8n achieved the highest pose mAP@50 score of 0.96. In terms of image processing speed, YOLO11n outperformed all configurations with an impressive inference speed of 2.7 ms, significantly faster than the quickest YOLOv8 configuration, YOLOv8n, which processed images in 7.8 ms. Subsequent integration of ViTs for the green fruit's pose depth estimation revealed that Depth Anything V2 outperformed Dense Prediction Transformer in 3D pose length validation, achieving the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.52 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.28, demonstrating exceptional precision in estimating immature green fruit lengths.

Given a priori obstacle-free feasible path where obstacles can be around the path, the task is to avoid obstacles while reaching the path and then staying on the path without leaving it. The problem is solved in two stages. Firstly, we define a ``tight'' obstacle-free neighborhood along the path and design a local controller to ensure convergence to the path and path invariance. The control barrier function technology is involved in the control design to steer the system away from its singularity points, where the local path invariant controller is not defined. Secondly, we design a hybrid control framework that integrates this local path-invariant controller with any global tracking controller from the existing literature without path invariance guarantee, ensuring convergence from any position to the desired path, namely, global convergence. This framework guarantees path invariance and robustness to sensor noise. Detailed simulation results affirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, initial submission to CCTA25</p></details> |

Unlike conventional approaches, which require explicit identification of malfunctioning actuators, our method allows the robot to surface using only the remaining operational actuators without needing to pinpoint the failures. The proposed controller learns a robust policy capable of handling diverse failure scenarios across different actuator configurations. Moreover, we introduce a transfer learning mechanism that shares a part of the control policy across various underwater robots with different actuators, thus improving learning efficiency and generalization across platforms. To validate our approach, we conduct simulations on three different types of underwater robots: a hovering-type AUV, a torpedo shaped AUV, and a turtle-shaped robot (U-CAT). Additionally, real-world experiments are performed, successfully transferring the learned policy from simulation to a physical U-CAT in a controlled environment. Our RL-based controller demonstrates superior performance in terms of stability and success rate compared to a baseline controller, achieving an 85.7 percent success rate in real-world tests compared to 57.1 percent with a baseline controller. This research provides a scalable and efficient solution for fault-tolerant control for diverse underwater platforms, with potential applications in real-world aquatic missions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2025 international Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

However, LLM hallucination may result in robots confidently executing plans that are misaligned with user goals or even unsafe in critical scenarios. Additionally, inherent ambiguity in natural language instructions can introduce uncertainty into the LLM's reasoning and planning processes.We propose introspective planning, a systematic approach that align LLM's uncertainty with the inherent ambiguity of the task. Our approach constructs a knowledge base containing introspective reasoning examples as post-hoc rationalizations of human-selected safe and compliant plans, which are retrieved during deployment. Evaluations on three tasks, including a newly introduced safe mobile manipulation benchmark, demonstrate that introspection substantially improves both compliance and safety over state-of-the-art LLM-based planning methods. Furthermore, we empirically show that introspective planning, in combination with conformal prediction, achieves tighter confidence bounds, maintaining statistical success guarantees while minimizing unnecessary user clarification requests.

| **[Centralization vs. decentralization in multi-robot sweep coverage with ground robots and UAVs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06553v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In swarm robotics, decentralized control is often proposed as a more scalable and fault-tolerant alternative to centralized control. However, centralized behaviors are often faster and more efficient than their decentralized counterparts. In any given application, the goals and constraints of the task being solved should guide the choice to use centralized control, decentralized control, or a combination of the two. Currently, the exact trade-offs that exist between centralization and decentralization are not well defined. In this paper, we study comparative performance assessment between centralization and decentralization in the example task of sweep coverage, across five different types of multi-robot control structures: random walk, decentralized with beacons, hybrid formation control using self-organizing hierarchy, centralized formation control, and predetermined. In all five approaches, the coverage task is completed by a group of ground robots. In each approach, except for the random walk, the ground robots are assisted by UAVs, acting as supervisors or beacons. We compare the approaches in terms of three performance metrics for which centralized approaches are expected to have an advantage -- coverage completeness, coverage uniformity, and sweep completion time -- and two metrics for which decentralized approaches are expected to have an advantage -- scalability (4, 8, or 16 ground robots) and fault tolerance (0%, 25%, 50%, or 75% ground robot failure). Finally, we discuss future work on combining the advantages of both in one system.</p></details> | <details><summary>IRIDI...</summary><p>IRIDIA, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium, 2021</p></details> |

While such facilities can offer realistic scenarios post an MCI that can serve training and educational purposes for first responders and humanitarian robots, they are often hard to access owing to logistical constraints. To overcome this challenge, we present HEROES- a versatile Unreal Engine simulator for designing novel training simulations for humans and emergency robots for such urban search and rescue operations. The proposed HEROES simulator is capable of generating synthetic datasets for machine learning pipelines that are used for training robot navigation. This work addresses the necessity for a comprehensive training platform in the robotics community, ensuring pragmatic and efficient preparation for real-world emergency scenarios. The strengths of our simulator lie in its adaptability, scalability, and ability to facilitate collaboration between robot developers and first responders, fostering synergy in developing effective strategies for search and rescue operations in MCIs. We conducted a preliminary user study with an 81% positive response supporting the ability of HEROES to generate sufficiently varied environments, and a 78% positive response affirming the usefulness of the simulation environment of HEROES.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied Red Teaming for Auditing Robotic Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18676v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-conditioned robot models have the potential to enable robots to perform a wide range of tasks based on natural language instructions. However, assessing their safety and effectiveness remains challenging because it is difficult to test all the different ways a single task can be phrased. Current benchmarks have two key limitations: they rely on a limited set of human-generated instructions, missing many challenging cases, and focus only on task performance without assessing safety, such as avoiding damage. To address these gaps, we introduce Embodied Red Teaming (ERT), a new evaluation method that generates diverse and challenging instructions to test these models. ERT uses automated red teaming techniques with Vision Language Models (VLMs) to create contextually grounded, difficult instructions. Experimental results show that state-of-the-art language-conditioned robot models fail or behave unsafely on ERT-generated instructions, underscoring the shortcomings of current benchmarks in evaluating real-world performance and safety.

LiDAR odometry systems are usually based on some form of point cloud registration to compute the ego-motion of a mobile robot. Yet, few of today's LiDAR odometry systems consider domain-specific knowledge or the kinematic model of the mobile platform during the point cloud alignment. In this paper, we present Kinematic-ICP, a LiDAR odometry system that focuses on wheeled mobile robots equipped with a 3D LiDAR and moving on a planar surface, which is a common assumption for warehouses, offices, hospitals, etc. Our approach introduces kinematic constraints within the optimization of a traditional point-to-point iterative closest point scheme. In this way, the resulting motion follows the kinematic constraints of the platform, effectively exploiting the robot's wheel odometry and the 3D LiDAR observations. We dynamically adjust the influence of LiDAR measurements and wheel odometry in our optimization scheme, allowing the system to handle degenerate scenarios such as feature-poor corridors. We evaluate our approach on robots operating in large-scale warehouse environments, but also outdoors. The experiments show that our approach achieves top performances and is more accurate than wheel odometry and common LiDAR odometry systems. Kinematic-ICP has been recently deployed in the Dexory fleet of robots operating in warehouses worldwide at their customers' sites, showing that our method can run in the real world alongside a complete navigation stack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2025</p></details> |

To realize these capabilities, SIREN harnesses the versatility and robustness of semantics in three critical ways to derive a rigorous registration pipeline for multi-robot GSplat maps. First, SIREN utilizes semantics to identify feature-rich regions of the local maps where the registration problem is better posed, eliminating the need for any initialization which is generally required in prior work. Second, SIREN identifies candidate correspondences between Gaussians in the local maps using robust semantic features, constituting the foundation for robust geometric optimization, coarsely aligning 3D Gaussian primitives extracted from the local maps. Third, this key step enables subsequent photometric refinement of the transformation between the submaps, where SIREN leverages novel-view synthesis in GSplat maps along with a semantics-based image filter to compute a high-accuracy non-rigid transformation for the generation of a high-fidelity fused map. We demonstrate the superior performance of SIREN compared to competing baselines across a range of real-world datasets, and in particular, across the most widely-used robot hardware platforms, including a manipulator, drone, and quadruped. In our experiments, SIREN achieves about 90x smaller rotation errors, 300x smaller translation errors, and 44x smaller scale errors in the most challenging scenes, where competing methods struggle. We will release the code and provide a link to the project page after the review process.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this goal, we introduce the Double Threshold Spiking neuron model with adjustable thresholds to generate varied output patterns. This neuron model can excite the natural dynamics of soft robotic snakes, and it enables distinct movements, such as turning or moving forward, by simply altering the neural thresholds. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach, termed SpikingSoft, naturally pairs and integrates with reinforcement learning. The high-level agent only needs to adjust the two thresholds to generate complex movement patterns, thus strongly simplifying the learning of reactive locomotion. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture significantly enhances the performance of the soft snake robot, enabling it to achieve target objectives with a 21.6% increase in success rate, a 29% reduction in time to reach the target, and smoother movements compared to the vanilla reinforcement learning controllers or Central Pattern Generator controller acting in torque space.</p></details> | <details><summary>8th I...</summary><p>8th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Soft Robotics</p></details> |

However, research on jointly optimizing poses and non-feature-based maps remains limited. Occupancy maps are widely used non-feature-based environment representations because they effectively classify spaces into obstacles, free areas, and unknown regions, providing robots with spatial information for various tasks. In this paper, we propose Occupancy-SLAM, a novel optimization-based SLAM method that enables the joint optimization of robot trajectory and the occupancy map through a parameterized map representation. The key novelty lies in optimizing both robot poses and occupancy values at different cell vertices simultaneously, a significant departure from existing methods where the robot poses need to be optimized first before the map can be estimated. Evaluations using simulations and practical 2D laser datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach can robustly obtain more accurate robot trajectories and occupancy maps than state-of-the-art techniques with comparable computational time. Preliminary results in the 3D case further confirm the potential of the proposed method in practical 3D applications, achieving more accurate results than existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-query Robotic Manipulator Task Sequencing with Gromov-Hausdorff Approximations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04800v3)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulator applications often require efficient online motion planning. When completing multiple tasks, sequence order and choice of goal configuration can have a drastic impact on planning performance. This is well known as the robot task sequencing problem (RTSP). Existing general-purpose RTSP algorithms are susceptible to producing poor-quality solutions or failing entirely when available computation time is restricted. We propose a new multi-query task sequencing method designed to operate in semi-structured environments with a combination of static and non-static obstacles. Our method intentionally trades off workspace generality for planning efficiency. Given a user-defined task space with static obstacles, we compute a subspace decomposition. The key idea is to establish approximate isometries known as $\epsilon$-Gromov-Hausdorff approximations that identify points that are close to one another in both task and configuration space. Importantly, we prove bounded suboptimality guarantees on the lengths of paths within these subspaces. These bounding relations further imply that paths within the same subspace can be smoothly concatenated, which we show is useful for determining efficient task sequences. We evaluate our method with several kinematic configurations in a complex simulated environment, achieving up to 3x faster motion planning and 5x lower maximum trajectory jerk compared to baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Condi...</summary><p>Conditionally accepted into IEEE Transactions on Robotics (TRO). 17 Pages. 16 Figures</p></details> |

The algorithm computes a feasible trajectory and corresponding control inputs for a robot to navigate between waypoints while avoiding obstacles, maximizing the total reward, and adhering to constraints on state, input and its derivatives, mission time window, and maximum distance. This also solves a generalized prize-collecting traveling salesman problem. The proposed algorithm employs a new genetic algorithm that evolves solution candidates toward the optimal solution based on a fitness function and crossover. During fitness evaluation, a penalty method enforces constraints, and the differential flatness property with clothoid curves efficiently penalizes infeasible trajectories. The Euler spiral method showed promising results for trajectory parameterization compared to minimum snap and jerk polynomials. Due to the discrete exploration space, crossover is performed using a dynamic time-warping-based method and extended convex combination with projection. A mutation step enhances exploration. Results demonstrate the algorithm's ability to find the optimal waypoint sequence, fulfill constraints, avoid infeasible waypoints, and prioritize high-reward ones. Simulations and experiments with a ground vehicle, quadrotor, and quadruped are presented, complemented by benchmarking and a time-complexity analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, the large size of point clouds poses challenges in terms of data storage and transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel point cloud compression and transmission framework for resource-constrained robotic applications, called RCPCC. We iteratively fit the surface of point clouds with a similar range value and eliminate redundancy through their spatial relationships. Then, we use Shape-adaptive DCT (SA-DCT) to transform the unfit points and reduce the data volume by quantizing the transformed coefficients. We design an adaptive bitrate control strategy based on QoE as the optimization goal to control the quality of the transmitted point cloud. Experiments show that our framework achieves compression rates of 40$\times$ to 80$\times$ while maintaining high accuracy for downstream applications. our method significantly outperforms other baselines in terms of accuracy when the compression rate exceeds 70$\times$. Furthermore, in situations of reduced communication bandwidth, our adaptive bitrate control strategy demonstrates significant QoE improvements.

Drone-based additive manufacturing promises flexible and autonomous material deposition in large-scale or hazardous environments. However, achieving robust real-time control of a multi-rotor aerial robot under varying payloads and potential disturbances remains challenging. Traditional controllers like PID often require frequent parameter re-tuning, limiting their applicability in dynamic scenarios. We propose a DRL framework that learns adaptable control policies for multi-rotor drones performing waypoint navigation in AM tasks. We compare Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) within a curriculum learning scheme designed to handle increasing complexity. Our experiments show TD3 consistently balances training stability, accuracy, and success, particularly when mass variability is introduced.

While such models hold great promise for robotics, the prevailing paradigm still portrays robots as single, autonomous decision-makers, performing tasks like manipulation and navigation, with limited human involvement. However, a large class of real-world robotic systems, including wearable robotics (e.g., prostheses, orthoses, exoskeletons), teleoperation, and neural interfaces, are semiautonomous, and require ongoing interactive coordination with human partners, challenging single-agent assumptions. In this position paper, we argue that robot foundation models must evolve to an interactive multi-agent perspective in order to handle the complexities of real-time human-robot co-adaptation. We propose a generalizable, neuroscience-inspired architecture encompassing four modules: (1) a multimodal sensing module informed by sensorimotor integration principles, (2) an ad-hoc teamwork model reminiscent of joint-action frameworks in cognitive science, (3) a predictive world belief model grounded in internal model theories of motor control, and (4) a memory/feedback mechanism that echoes concepts of Hebbian and reinforcement-based plasticity. Although illustrated through the lens of cyborg systems, where wearable devices and human physiology are inseparably intertwined, the proposed framework is broadly applicable to robots operating in semi-autonomous or interactive contexts. By moving beyond single-agent designs, our position emphasizes how foundation models in robotics can achieve a more robust, personalized, and anticipatory level of performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human Arm Pose Estimation with a Shoulder-worn Force-Myography Device for Human-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07644v2)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate human pose estimation is essential for effective Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). By observing a user's arm movements, robots can respond appropriately, whether it's providing assistance or avoiding collisions. While visual perception offers potential for human pose estimation, it can be hindered by factors like poor lighting or occlusions. Additionally, wearable inertial sensors, though useful, require frequent calibration as they do not provide absolute position information. Force-myography (FMG) is an alternative approach where muscle perturbations are externally measured. It has been used to observe finger movements, but its application to full arm state estimation is unexplored. In this letter, we investigate the use of a wearable FMG device that can observe the state of the human arm for real-time applications of HRI. We propose a Transformer-based model to map FMG measurements from the shoulder of the user to the physical pose of the arm. The model is also shown to be transferable to other users with limited decline in accuracy. Through real-world experiments with a robotic arm, we demonstrate collision avoidance without relying on visual perception.</p></details> |  |

While vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise for generalizable robot skills, realizing their full potential requires addressing limitations in action representation and efficient training. Current VLA models often focus on scaling the vision-language model (VLM) component, while the action space representation remains a critical bottleneck. This paper introduces DexVLA, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency and generalization capabilities of VLAs for complex, long-horizon tasks across diverse robot embodiments. DexVLA features a novel diffusion-based action expert, scaled to one billion parameters, designed for cross-embodiment learning. A novel embodiment curriculum learning strategy facilitates efficient training: (1) pre-training the diffusion expert that is separable from the VLA on cross-embodiment data, (2) aligning the VLA model to specific embodiments, and (3) post-training for rapid adaptation to new tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple embodiments, including single-arm, bimanual, and dexterous hand, demonstrating DexVLA's adaptability to challenging tasks without task-specific adaptation, its ability to learn dexterous skills on novel embodiments with limited data, and its capacity to complete complex, long-horizon tasks using only direct language prompting, such as laundry folding. In all settings, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models like Octo, OpenVLA, and Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The w...</summary><p>The webpage is at https://dex-vla.github.io/</p></details> |

However, enabling robots to appropriately use implicit communication in cooperative tasks remains challenging. My research addresses this through three phases: first, exploring the impact of linguistic implicatures on collaborative tasks; second, examining how robots' implicit cues for backchanneling and proactive communication affect team performance and perception, and how they should adapt to human teammates; and finally, designing and evaluating a multi-LLM robotics system that learns from human implicit communication. This research aims to enhance the natural communication abilities of robots and facilitate their integration into daily collaborative activities.</p></details> | Accepted by HRI2025 |
| **[Online Controller Synthesis for Robot Collision Avoidance: A Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05667v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inherent uncertainty of dynamic environments poses significant challenges for modeling robot behavior, particularly in tasks such as collision avoidance. This paper presents an online controller synthesis framework tailored for robots equipped with deep learning-based perception components, with a focus on addressing distribution shifts. Our approach integrates periodic monitoring and repair mechanisms for the deep neural network perception component, followed by uncertainty reassessment. These uncertainty evaluations are injected into a parametric discrete-time markov chain, enabling the synthesis of robust controllers via probabilistic model checking. To ensure high system availability during the repair process, we propose a dual-component configuration that seamlessly transitions between operational states. Through a case study on robot collision avoidance, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method, showcasing substantial performance improvements over baseline approaches. This work provides a comprehensive and scalable solution for enhancing the safety and reliability of autonomous systems operating in uncertain environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data efficient Robotic Object Throwing with Model-Based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05595v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pick-and-place (PnP) operations, featuring object grasping and trajectory planning, are fundamental in industrial robotics applications. Despite many advancements in the field, PnP is limited by workspace constraints, reducing flexibility. Pick-and-throw (PnT) is a promising alternative where the robot throws objects to target locations, leveraging extrinsic resources like gravity to improve efficiency and expand the workspace. However, PnT execution is complex, requiring precise coordination of high-speed movements and object dynamics. Solutions to the PnT problem are categorized into analytical and learning-based approaches. Analytical methods focus on system modeling and trajectory generation but are time-consuming and offer limited generalization. Learning-based solutions, in particular Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (MFRL), offer automation and adaptability but require extensive interaction time. This paper introduces a Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) framework, MC-PILOT, which combines data-driven modeling with policy optimization for efficient and accurate PnT tasks. MC-PILOT accounts for model uncertainties and release errors, demonstrating superior performance in simulations and real-world tests with a Franka Emika Panda manipulator. The proposed approach generalizes rapidly to new targets, offering advantages over analytical and Model-Free methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint under review</p></details> |

Inspired by human protocols that combine visual identification with acoustic verification, this study proposes a deep learning-based robotic system for autonomously detecting and classifying gas leaks and arc discharges in manufacturing settings. The system is designed to execute all experimental tasks entirely onboard the robot. Utilizing a 112-channel acoustic camera operating at a 96 kHz sampling rate to capture ultrasonic frequencies, the system processes real-world datasets recorded in diverse industrial scenarios. These datasets include multiple gas leak configurations (e.g., pinhole, open end) and partial discharge types (Corona, Surface, Floating) under varying environmental noise conditions. Proposed system integrates visual detection and a beamforming-enhanced acoustic analysis pipeline. Signals are transformed using STFT and refined through Gamma Correction, enabling robust feature extraction. An Inception-inspired CNN further classifies hazards, achieving 99% gas leak detection accuracy. The system not only detects individual hazard sources but also enhances classification reliability by fusing multi-modal data from both vision and acoustic sensors. When tested in reverberation and noise-augmented environments, the system outperformed conventional models by up to 44%p, with experimental tasks meticulously designed to ensure fairness and reproducibility. Additionally, the system is optimized for real-time deployment, maintaining an inference time of 2.1 seconds on a mobile robotic platform. By emulating human-like inspection protocols and integrating vision with acoustic modalities, this study presents an effective solution for industrial automation, significantly improving safety and operational reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

Individuals with physical limitations may find existing interfaces challenging to use, highlighting the need for novel interfaces that can effectively support them. In this work, we present insights on the design and evaluation of an active control wearable interface named HAT, Head-Worn Assistive Teleoperation. To tackle challenges in user workload while using such interfaces, we propose and evaluate a shared control algorithm named Driver Assistance. Finally, we introduce the concept of passive control, in which wearable interfaces detect implicit human signals to inform and guide robotic actions during caregiving tasks, with the aim of reducing user workload while potentially preserving the feeling of control.</p></details> |  |

For robots with a useful number of DoF, these geometric mechanics models can only be constructed in the neighborhood of a gait. Here we show how Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) can be used as a form of manifold learning that learns the structure of the Geometric Mechanics "motility map" and demonstrate: [i] a sizable improvement in prediction quality when compared to the previously published methods; [ii] a method that can be applied to any motion dataset and not only periodic gait data; [iii] a way to pre-process the data-set to facilitate extrapolation in places where the motility map is known to be linear. Our results can be applied anywhere a data-driven geometric motion model might be useful.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Use of Winsome Robots for Understanding Human Feedback (UWU)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05118v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As social robots become more common, many have adopted cute aesthetics aiming to enhance user comfort and acceptance. However, the effect of this aesthetic choice on human feedback in reinforcement learning scenarios remains unclear. Previous research has shown that humans tend to give more positive than negative feedback, which can cause failure to reach optimal robot behavior. We hypothesize that this positive bias may be exacerbated by the robot's level of perceived cuteness. To investigate, we conducted a user study where participants critique a robot's trajectories while it performs a task. We then analyzed the impact of the robot's aesthetic cuteness on the type of participant feedback. Our results suggest that there is a shift in the ratio of positive to negative feedback when perceived cuteness changes. In light of this, we experiment with a stochastic version of TAMER which adapts based on the user's level of positive feedback bias to mitigate these effects.</p></details> | placeholder |

Existing datasets have significantly advanced learning in manipulation but are primarily focused on simpler tasks like object rearrangement, falling short of capturing the complexity and physical dynamics involved in assembly and disassembly. To bridge this gap, we present REASSEMBLE (Robotic assEmbly disASSEMBLy datasEt), a new dataset designed specifically for contact-rich manipulation tasks. Built around the NIST Assembly Task Board 1 benchmark, REASSEMBLE includes four actions (pick, insert, remove, and place) involving 17 objects. The dataset contains 4,551 demonstrations, of which 4,035 were successful, spanning a total of 781 minutes. Our dataset features multi-modal sensor data including event cameras, force-torque sensors, microphones, and multi-view RGB cameras. This diverse dataset supports research in areas such as learning contact-rich manipulation, task condition identification, action segmentation, and more. We believe REASSEMBLE will be a valuable resource for advancing robotic manipulation in complex, real-world scenarios. The dataset is publicly available on our project website: https://dsliwowski1.github.io/REASSEMBLE_page.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Gaze-Guided Robotic Vascular Ultrasound Leveraging Human Intention Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05053v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical ultrasound has been widely used to examine vascular structure in modern clinical practice. However, traditional ultrasound examination often faces challenges related to inter- and intra-operator variation. The robotic ultrasound system (RUSS) appears as a potential solution for such challenges because of its superiority in stability and reproducibility. Given the complex anatomy of human vasculature, multiple vessels often appear in ultrasound images, or a single vessel bifurcates into branches, complicating the examination process. To tackle this challenge, this work presents a gaze-guided RUSS for vascular applications. A gaze tracker captures the eye movements of the operator. The extracted gaze signal guides the RUSS to follow the correct vessel when it bifurcates. Additionally, a gaze-guided segmentation network is proposed to enhance segmentation robustness by exploiting gaze information. However, gaze signals are often noisy, requiring interpretation to accurately discern the operator's true intentions. To this end, this study proposes a stabilization module to process raw gaze data. The inferred attention heatmap is utilized as a region proposal to aid segmentation and serve as a trigger signal when the operator needs to adjust the scanning target, such as when a bifurcation appears. To ensure appropriate contact between the probe and surface during scanning, an automatic ultrasound confidence-based orientation correction method is developed. In experiments, we demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed gaze-guided segmentation pipeline by comparing it with other methods. Besides, the performance of the proposed gaze-guided RUSS was also validated as a whole on a realistic arm phantom with an uneven surface.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferring Foundation Models for Generalizable Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05716v5)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the generalization capabilities of general-purpose robotic manipulation agents in the real world has long been a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on collecting large-scale robotic data which is costly and time-consuming, such as the RT-1 dataset. However, due to insufficient diversity of data, these approaches typically suffer from limiting their capability in open-domain scenarios with new objects and diverse environments. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that effectively leverages language-reasoning segmentation mask generated by internet-scale foundation models, to condition robot manipulation tasks. By integrating the mask modality, which incorporates semantic, geometric, and temporal correlation priors derived from vision foundation models, into the end-to-end policy model, our approach can effectively and robustly perceive object pose and enable sample-efficient generalization learning, including new object instances, semantic categories, and unseen backgrounds. We first introduce a series of foundation models to ground natural language demands across multiple tasks. Secondly, we develop a two-stream 2D policy model based on imitation learning, which processes raw images and object masks to predict robot actions with a local-global perception manner. Extensive realworld experiments conducted on a Franka Emika robot arm demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm and policy architecture. Demos can be found in our submitted video, and more comprehensive ones can be found in link1 or link2.</p></details> | WACV 2025, Oral |
| **[Effective Sampling for Robot Motion Planning Through the Lens of Lattices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04908v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling-based methods for motion planning, which capture the structure of the robot's free space via (typically random) sampling, have gained popularity due to their scalability, simplicity, and for offering global guarantees, such as probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality. Unfortunately, the practicality of those guarantees remains limited as they do not provide insights into the behavior of motion planners for a finite number of samples (i.e., a finite running time). In this work, we harness lattice theory and the concept of $(\delta,\epsilon)$-completeness by Tsao et al. (2020) to construct deterministic sample sets that endow their planners with strong finite-time guarantees while minimizing running time. In particular, we introduce a highly-efficient deterministic sampling approach based on the $A_d^*$ lattice, which is the best-known geometric covering in dimensions $\leq 21$. Using our new sampling approach, we obtain at least an order-of-magnitude speedup over existing deterministic and uniform random sampling methods for complex motion-planning problems. Overall, our work provides deep mathematical insights while advancing the practical applicability of sampling-based motion planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Robot Motion Planning Methodology Guided by Group Social Proxemics Feature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04837v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays robot is supposed to demonstrate human-like perception, reasoning and behavior pattern in social or service application. However, most of the existing motion planning methods are incompatible with above requirement. A potential reason is that the existing navigation algorithms usually intend to treat people as another kind of obstacle, and hardly take the social principle or awareness into consideration. In this paper, we attempt to model the proxemics of group and blend it into the scenario perception and navigation of robot. For this purpose, a group clustering method considering both social relevance and spatial confidence is introduced. It can enable robot to identify individuals and divide them into groups. Next, we propose defining the individual proxemics within magnetic dipole model, and further established the group proxemics and scenario map through vector-field superposition. On the basis of the group clustering and proxemics modeling, we present the method to obtain the optimal observation positions (OOPs) of group. Once the OOPs grid and scenario map are established, a heuristic path is employed to generate path that guide robot cruising among the groups for interactive purpose. A series of experiments are conducted to validate the proposed methodology on the practical robot, the results have demonstrated that our methodology has achieved promising performance on group recognition accuracy and path-generation efficiency. This concludes that the group awareness evolved as an important module to make robot socially behave in the practical scenario.</p></details> | 14 pages,14 figures |
| **[Oblivious Robots Under Round Robin: Gathering on Rings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03939v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots with very limited capabilities are placed on the vertices of a graph and are required to move toward a single, common vertex, where they remain stationary once they arrive. This task is referred to as the GATHERING problem. Most of the research on this topic has focused on feasibility challenges in the asynchronous setting, where robots operate independently of each other. A common assumption in these studies is that robots are equipped with multiplicity detection, the ability to recognize whether a vertex is occupied by more than one robot. Additionally, initial configurations are often restricted to ensure that no vertex hosts more than one robot. A key difficulty arises from the possible symmetries in the robots' placement relative to the graph's topology. This paper investigates the GATHERING problem on Rings under a sequential scheduler, where only one robot at a time is active. While this sequential activation helps to break symmetries, we remove two common assumptions: robots do not have multiplicity detection, and in initial configurations, vertices can be occupied by multiplicities. We prove that such a generalized GATHERING problem cannot be solved under general sequential schedulers. However, we provide a complete characterization of the problem when a sequential Round Robin scheduler is used, where robots are activated one at a time in a fixed cyclic order that repeats indefinitely. Furthermore, we fully characterize the DISTINCT GATHERING problem, the most used variant of GATHERING, in which the initial configurations do not admit multiplicities.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Parameter-Efficient Tuning Framework for Language-guided Object Grounding and Robot Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19457v4)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The language-guided robot grasping task requires a robot agent to integrate multimodal information from both visual and linguistic inputs to predict actions for target-driven grasping. While recent approaches utilizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising results, their extensive computation and data demands limit the feasibility of local deployment and customization. To address this, we propose a novel CLIP-based multimodal parameter-efficient tuning (PET) framework designed for three language-guided object grounding and grasping tasks: (1) Referring Expression Segmentation (RES), (2) Referring Grasp Synthesis (RGS), and (3) Referring Grasp Affordance (RGA). Our approach introduces two key innovations: a bi-directional vision-language adapter that aligns multimodal inputs for pixel-level language understanding and a depth fusion branch that incorporates geometric cues to facilitate robot grasping predictions. Experiment results demonstrate superior performance in the RES object grounding task compared with existing CLIP-based full-model tuning or PET approaches. In the RGS and RGA tasks, our model not only effectively interprets object attributes based on simple language descriptions but also shows strong potential for comprehending complex spatial reasoning scenarios, such as multiple identical objects present in the workspace.

Collaborative efforts among roboticists, ES, physical and occupational therapists, and patients are essential for developing interactive, personalized exercise systems that meet each stakeholder's needs. We conducted a user study in which 11 ES evaluated a novel robot-led PT system for people with Parkinson's disease (PD), introduced in [1], focusing on the system's perceived efficacy and acceptance. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, including technology acceptance questionnaires, task load questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews, we gathered comprehensive insights into ES perspectives and experiences after interacting with the system. Findings reveal a broadly positive reception, which highlights the system's capacity to augment traditional PT for PD, enhance patient engagement, and ensure consistent exercise support. We also identified two key areas for improvement: incorporating more human-like feedback systems and increasing the robot's ease of use. This research emphasizes the value of incorporating robotic aids into PT for PD, offering insights that can guide the development of more effective and user-friendly rehabilitation technologies.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

To address this, we propose AnyPlace, a two-stage method trained entirely on synthetic data, capable of predicting a wide range of feasible placement poses for real-world tasks. Our key insight is that by leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to identify rough placement locations, we focus only on the relevant regions for local placement, which enables us to train the low-level placement-pose-prediction model to capture diverse placements efficiently. For training, we generate a fully synthetic dataset of randomly generated objects in different placement configurations (insertion, stacking, hanging) and train local placement-prediction models. We conduct extensive evaluations in simulation, demonstrating that our method outperforms baselines in terms of success rate, coverage of possible placement modes, and precision. In real-world experiments, we show how our approach directly transfers models trained purely on synthetic data to the real world, where it successfully performs placements in scenarios where other models struggle -- such as with varying object geometries, diverse placement modes, and achieving high precision for fine placement.

| **[Multi-Robot Scan-n-Print for Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15915v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) is a metal additive manufacturing technology, offering flexible 3D printing while ensuring high quality near-net-shape final parts. However, WAAM also suffers from geometric imprecision, especially for low-melting-point metal such as aluminum alloys. In this paper, we present a multi-robot framework for WAAM process monitoring and control. We consider a three-robot setup: a 6-dof welding robot, a 2-dof trunnion platform, and a 6-dof sensing robot with a wrist-mounted laser line scanner measuring the printed part height profile. The welding parameters, including the wire feed rate, are held constant based on the materials used, so the control input is the robot path speed. The measured output is the part height profile. The planning phase decomposes the target shape into slices of uniform height. During runtime, the sensing robot scans each printed layer, and the robot path speed for the next layer is adjusted based on the deviation from the desired profile. The adjustment is based on an identified model correlating the path speed to change in height. The control architecture coordinates the synchronous motion and data acquisition between all robots and sensors. Using a three-robot WAAM testbed, we demonstrate significant improvements of the closed loop scan-n-print approach over the current open loop result on both a flat wall and a more complex turbine blade shape.</p></details> |  |

To do this, we introduce a measure of uncertainty that we term "Behavioral entropy", which builds on Prelec's probability weighting from Behavioral Economics. We show that the new operator is an admissible generalized entropy, analyze its theoretical properties and compare it with other common formulations such as Shannon's and Renyi's. In particular, we discuss how the new formulation is more expressive in the sense of measures of sensitivity and perceptiveness to uncertainty introduced here. Then we use Behavioral entropy to define a new type of utility function that can guide a frontier-based environment exploration process. The approach's benefits are illustrated and compared in a Proof-of-Concept and ROS-Unity simulation environment with a Clearpath Warthog robot. We show that the robot equipped with Behavioral entropy explores faster than Shannon and Renyi entropies.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2024 IEEE.

This study introduces Echo-Teddy, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based social robot designed to support autistic students in developing social and communication skills. Unlike previous chatbot-based solutions, Echo-Teddy leverages advanced LLM capabilities to provide more natural and adaptive interactions. The research addresses two key questions: (1) What are the design principles and initial prototype characteristics of an effective LLM-based social robot for autistic students? (2) What improvements can be made based on developer reflection-on-action and expert interviews? The study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining prototype development with qualitative analysis of developer reflections and expert interviews. Key design principles identified include customizability, ethical considerations, and age-appropriate interactions. The initial prototype, built on a Raspberry Pi platform, features custom speech components and basic motor functions. Evaluation of the prototype revealed potential improvements in areas such as user interface, educational value, and practical implementation in educational settings. This research contributes to the growing field of AI-assisted special education by demonstrating the potential of LLM-based social robots in supporting autistic students. The findings provide valuable insights for future developments in accessible and effective social support tools for special education.</p></details> |  |

However, the generalist would struggle with inefficient inference and cost-expensive training. The specialist policy, instead, is curated for specific domain data and excels at task-level precision with efficiency. Yet, it lacks the generalization capacity for a wide range of applications. Inspired by these observations, we introduce RoboDual, a synergistic dual-system that supplements the merits of both generalist and specialist policy. A diffusion transformer-based specialist is devised for multi-step action rollouts, exquisitely conditioned on the high-level task understanding and discretized action output of a vision-language-action (VLA) based generalist. Compared to OpenVLA, RoboDual achieves 26.7% improvement in real-world setting and 12% gain on CALVIN by introducing a specialist policy with merely 20M trainable parameters.

| **[Malleable Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04012v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This chapter is about the fundamentals of fabrication, control, and human-robot interaction of a new type of collaborative robotic manipulators, called malleable robots, which are based on adjustable architectures of varying stiffness for achieving high dexterity with lower mobility arms. Collaborative robots, or cobots, commonly integrate six or more degrees of freedom (DOF) in a serial arm in order to allow positioning in constrained spaces and adaptability across tasks. Increasing the dexterity of robotic arms has been indeed traditionally accomplished by increasing the number of degrees of freedom of the system; however, once a robotic task has been established (e.g., a pick-and-place operation), the motion of the end-effector can be normally achieved using less than 6-DOF (i.e., lower mobility). The aim of malleable robots is to close the technological gap that separates current cobots from achieving flexible, accessible manufacturing automation with a reduced number of actuators.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 22 figures, chapter 7 of "Handbook on Soft Robotics"</p></details> |
| **[A Flexible FBG-Based Contact Force Sensor for Robotic Gripping Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03914v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robotic grippers demonstrate great potential for gently and safely handling objects; however, their full potential for executing precise and secure grasping has been limited by the lack of integrated sensors, leading to problems such as slippage and excessive force exertion. To address this challenge, we present a small and highly sensitive Fiber Bragg Grating-based force sensor designed for accurate contact force measurement. The flexible force sensor comprises a 3D-printed TPU casing with a small bump and uvula structure, a dual FBG array, and a protective tube. A series of tests have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed force sensor, including force calibration, repeatability test, hysteresis study, force measurement comparison, and temperature calibration and compensation tests. The results demonstrated good repeatability, with a force measurement range of 4.69 N, a high sensitivity of approximately 1169.04 pm/N, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12 N, and a maximum hysteresis of 4.83%. When compared to a commercial load cell, the sensor showed a percentage error of 2.56% and an RMSE of 0.14 N. Besides, the proposed sensor validated its temperature compensation effectiveness, with a force RMSE of 0.01 N over a temperature change of 11 Celsius degree. The sensor was integrated with a soft grow-and-twine gripper to monitor interaction forces between different objects and the robotic gripper. Closed-loop force control was applied during automated pick-and-place tasks and significantly improved gripping stability, as demonstrated in tests. This force sensor can be used across manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare (like prosthetic hands), logistics, and packaging, to provide situation awareness and higher operational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simultaneous Multi-Robot Motion Planning with Projected Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03607v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models hold significant potential in robotics, enabling the generation of diverse and smooth trajectories directly from raw representations of the environment. Despite this promise, applying diffusion models to motion planning remains challenging due to their difficulty in enforcing critical constraints, such as collision avoidance and kinematic feasibility. These limitations become even more pronounced in Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP), where multiple robots must coordinate in shared spaces. To address this challenge, this work proposes Simultaneous MRMP Diffusion (SMD), a novel approach integrating constrained optimization into the diffusion sampling process to produce collision-free, kinematically feasible trajectories. Additionally, the paper introduces a comprehensive MRMP benchmark to evaluate trajectory planning algorithms across scenarios with varying robot densities, obstacle complexities, and motion constraints. Experimental results show SMD consistently outperforms classical and learning-based motion planners, achieving higher success rates and efficiency in complex multi-robot environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Communication in Human-Robot Collaborative Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03346v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We focus on human-robot collaborative transport, in which a robot and a user collaboratively move an object to a goal pose. In the absence of explicit communication, this problem is challenging because it demands tight implicit coordination between two heterogeneous agents, who have very different sensing, actuation, and reasoning capabilities. Our key insight is that the two agents can coordinate fluently by encoding subtle, communicative signals into actions that affect the state of the transported object. To this end, we design an inference mechanism that probabilistically maps observations of joint actions executed by the two agents to a set of joint strategies of workspace traversal. Based on this mechanism, we define a cost representing the human's uncertainty over the unfolding traversal strategy and introduce it into a model predictive controller that balances between uncertainty minimization and efficiency maximization. We deploy our framework on a mobile manipulator (Hello Robot Stretch) and evaluate it in a within-subjects lab study (N=24). We show that our framework enables greater team performance and empowers the robot to be perceived as a significantly more fluent and competent partner compared to baselines lacking a communicative mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[IRIS: An Immersive Robot Interaction System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03297v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces IRIS, an immersive Robot Interaction System leveraging Extended Reality (XR), designed for robot data collection and interaction across multiple simulators, benchmarks, and real-world scenarios. While existing XR-based data collection systems provide efficient and intuitive solutions for large-scale data collection, they are often challenging to reproduce and reuse. This limitation arises because current systems are highly tailored to simulator-specific use cases and environments. IRIS is a novel, easily extendable framework that already supports multiple simulators, benchmarks, and even headsets. Furthermore, IRIS is able to include additional information from real-world sensors, such as point clouds captured through depth cameras. A unified scene specification is generated directly from simulators or real-world sensors and transmitted to XR headsets, creating identical scenes in XR. This specification allows IRIS to support any of the objects, assets, and robots provided by the simulators. In addition, IRIS introduces shared spatial anchors and a robust communication protocol that links simulations between multiple XR headsets. This feature enables multiple XR headsets to share a synchronized scene, facilitating collaborative and multi-user data collection. IRIS can be deployed on any device that supports the Unity Framework, encompassing the vast majority of commercially available headsets. In this work, IRIS was deployed and tested on the Meta Quest 3 and the HoloLens 2. IRIS showcased its versatility across a wide range of real-world and simulated scenarios, using current popular robot simulators such as MuJoCo, IsaacSim, CoppeliaSim, and Genesis. In addition, a user study evaluates IRIS on a data collection task for the LIBERO benchmark. The study shows that IRIS significantly outperforms the baseline in both objective and subjective metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fault-Tolerant Control for System Availability and Continuous Operation in Heavy-Duty Wheeled Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03278v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When the control system in a heavy-duty wheeled mobile robot (HD-WMR) malfunctions, deviations from ideal motion occur, significantly heightening the risks of off-road instability and costly damage. To meet the demands for safety, reliability, and controllability in HD-WMRs, the control system must tolerate faults to a certain extent, ensuring continuous operation. To this end, this paper introduces a model-free hierarchical control with fault accommodation (MFHCA) framework designed to address sensor and actuator faults in hydraulically powered HD-WMRs with independently controlled wheels. To begin, a novel mathematical representation of the motion dynamics of HD-WMRs, incorporating both sensor and actuator fault modes, is investigated. Subsequently, the MFHCA framework is proposed to manage all wheels under various fault modes, ensuring that each wheel tracks the reference driving velocities and steering angles, which are inverse kinematically mapped from the angular and linear velocities commanded in the HD-WMR's base frame. To do so, this framework generates appropriate power efforts in independently valve-regulated wheels to accommodate the adaptively isolated faults, thereby ensuring exponential stability. The experimental analysis of a 6,500-kg hydraulic-powered HD-WMR under various fault modes and rough terrains demonstrates the validity of the MFHCA framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review by IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics (TMECH)</p></details> |
| **[When Pre-trained Visual Representations Fall Short: Limitations in Visuo-Motor Robot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03270v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) into visuo-motor robot learning has emerged as a promising alternative to training visual encoders from scratch. However, PVRs face critical challenges in the context of policy learning, including temporal entanglement and an inability to generalise even in the presence of minor scene perturbations. These limitations hinder performance in tasks requiring temporal awareness and robustness to scene changes. This work identifies these shortcomings and proposes solutions to address them. First, we augment PVR features with temporal perception and a sense of task completion, effectively disentangling them in time. Second, we introduce a module that learns to selectively attend to task-relevant local features, enhancing robustness when evaluated on out-of-distribution scenes. Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements, particularly in PVRs trained with masking objectives, and validate the effectiveness of our enhancements in addressing PVR-specific limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZISVFM: Zero-Shot Object Instance Segmentation in Indoor Robotic Environments with Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03266v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service robots operating in unstructured environments must effectively recognize and segment unknown objects to enhance their functionality. Traditional supervised learningbased segmentation techniques require extensive annotated datasets, which are impractical for the diversity of objects encountered in real-world scenarios. Unseen Object Instance Segmentation (UOIS) methods aim to address this by training models on synthetic data to generalize to novel objects, but they often suffer from the simulation-to-reality gap. This paper proposes a novel approach (ZISVFM) for solving UOIS by leveraging the powerful zero-shot capability of the segment anything model (SAM) and explicit visual representations from a selfsupervised vision transformer (ViT). The proposed framework operates in three stages: (1) generating object-agnostic mask proposals from colorized depth images using SAM, (2) refining these proposals using attention-based features from the selfsupervised ViT to filter non-object masks, and (3) applying K-Medoids clustering to generate point prompts that guide SAM towards precise object segmentation. Experimental validation on two benchmark datasets and a self-collected dataset demonstrates the superior performance of ZISVFM in complex environments, including hierarchical settings such as cabinets, drawers, and handheld objects.
