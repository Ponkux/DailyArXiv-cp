| **[AgentSense: Virtual Sensor Data Generation Using LLM Agents in Simulated Home Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11773v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge in developing robust and generalizable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems for smart homes is the lack of large and diverse labeled datasets. Variations in home layouts, sensor configurations, and individual behaviors further exacerbate this issue. To address this, we leverage the idea of embodied AI agents-virtual agents that perceive and act within simulated environments guided by internal world models. We introduce AgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline in which agents live out daily routines in simulated smart homes, with behavior guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM generates diverse synthetic personas and realistic routines grounded in the environment, which are then decomposed into fine-grained actions. These actions are executed in an extended version of the VirtualHome simulator, which we augment with virtual ambient sensors that record the agents' activities. Our approach produces rich, privacy-preserving sensor data that reflects real-world diversity. We evaluate AgentSense on five real HAR datasets. Models pretrained on the generated data consistently outperform baselines, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore, combining the generated virtual sensor data with a small amount of real data achieves performance comparable to training on full real-world datasets. These results highlight the potential of using LLM-guided embodied agents for scalable and cost-effective sensor data generation in HAR.</p></details> |  |
| **[IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16402v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems. Code and data are released under [this https URL](https://github.com/AI45Lab/IS-Bench).</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboBrain 2.0 Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02029v4)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce RoboBrain 2.0, our latest generation of embodied vision-language foundation models, designed to unify perception, reasoning, and planning for complex embodied tasks in physical environments. It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents. The code, checkpoint and benchmark are available at https://superrobobrain.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconstructing 4D Spatial Intelligence: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21045v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI, which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally, existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes (e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints. We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D spatial intelligence. To track ongoing developments, we maintain an up-to-date project page: https://github.com/yukangcao/Awesome-4D-Spatial-Intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/yukangcao/Awesome-4D-Spatial-Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Exploring 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Activity Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D task planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advances in multimodal learning. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v4)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Robotic Manipulation Generalization with Minimal Costly Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19516v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied AI intensifies the demand for diverse manipulation demonstrations. However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the RoboTron-Craft, a stage-divided and cost-effective pipeline for realistic manipulation generation. Base on this, the RoboTron-Platter method is introduced, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.

| **[Object Affordance Recognition and Grounding via Multi-scale Cross-modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01184v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification). Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance grounding and classification.</p></details> |  |

Addressing a gap in retail-specific sim environments for embodied agent training, Sari Sandbox features over 250 interactive grocery items across three store configurations, controlled via an API. It supports both virtual reality (VR) for human interaction and a vision language model (VLM)-powered embodied agent. We also introduce SariBench, a dataset of annotated human demonstrations across varied task difficulties. Our sandbox enables embodied agents to navigate, inspect, and manipulate retail items, providing baselines against human performance. We conclude with benchmarks, performance analysis, and recommendations for enhancing realism and scalability.

| **[OpenFly: A Comprehensive Platform for Aerial Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18041v6)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to guide agents by leveraging language instructions and visual cues, playing a pivotal role in embodied AI. Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising various rendering engines, a versatile toolchain, and a large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we integrate diverse rendering engines and advanced techniques for environment simulation, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of our environments. Secondly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for aerial VLN data collection, streamlining point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Thirdly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. Moreover, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model emphasizing key observations during flight. For benchmarking, extensive experiments and analyses are conducted, evaluating several recent VLN methods and showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Exploring the Link Between Bayesian Inference and Embodied Intelligence: Toward Open Physical-World Embodied AI Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21589v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open physical-world embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Multifunctional physical reservoir computing in soft tensegrity robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21496v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of physical systems can be utilized for the desired information processing under the framework of physical reservoir computing (PRC). Robots with soft bodies are examples of such physical systems, and their nonlinear body-environment dynamics can be used to compute and generate the motor signals necessary for the control of their own behavior. In this simulation study, we extend this approach to control and embed not only one but also multiple behaviors into a type of soft robot called a tensegrity robot. The resulting system, consisting of the robot and the environment, is a multistable dynamical system that converges to different attractors from varying initial conditions. Furthermore, attractor analysis reveals that there exist "untrained attractors" in the state space of the system outside the training data. These untrained attractors reflect the intrinsic properties and structures of the tensegrity robot and its interactions with the environment. The impacts of these recent findings in PRC remain unexplored in embodied AI research. We here illustrate their potential to understand various features of embodied cognition that have not been fully addressed to date.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 12 figures.

| **[MazeEval: A Benchmark for Testing Sequential Decision-Making in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20395v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment. Despite advances in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$, other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100% of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English, suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable navigation across linguistic contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Salsa as a Nonverbal Embodied Language -- The CoMPAS3D Dataset and Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19684v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imagine a humanoid that can safely and creatively dance with a human, adapting to its partner's proficiency, using haptic signaling as a primary form of communication. While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive, expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types, combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation) generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive humanoid motion generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://rosielab.github.io/compas3d</p></details> |
| **[Advances in 4D Generation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14501v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative artificial intelligence has recently progressed from static image and video synthesis to 3D content generation, culminating in the emergence of 4D generation-the task of synthesizing temporally coherent dynamic 3D assets guided by user input. As a burgeoning research frontier, 4D generation enables richer interactive and immersive experiences, with applications ranging from digital humans to autonomous driving. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks a unified understanding of 4D representations, generative frameworks, basic paradigms, and the core technical challenges it faces. This survey provides a systematic and in-depth review of the 4D generation landscape. To comprehensively characterize 4D generation, we first categorize fundamental 4D representations and outline associated techniques for 4D generation. We then present an in-depth analysis of representative generative pipelines based on conditions and representation methods. Subsequently, we discuss how motion and geometry priors are integrated into 4D outputs to ensure spatio-temporal consistency under various control schemes. From an application perspective, this paper summarizes 4D generation tasks in areas such as dynamic object/scene generation, digital human synthesis, editable 4D content, and embodied AI. Furthermore, we summarize and multi-dimensionally compare four basic paradigms for 4D generation: End-to-End, Generated-Data-Based, Implicit-Distillation-Based, and Explicit-Supervision-Based. Concluding our analysis, we highlight five key challenges-consistency, controllability, diversity, efficiency, and fidelity-and contextualize these with current approaches.By distilling recent advances and outlining open problems, this work offers a comprehensive and forward-looking perspective to guide future research in 4D generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[BoxFusion: Reconstruction-Free Open-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection via Real-Time Multi-View Box Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15610v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lanlan96.github.io/BoxFusion/</p></details> |
| **[ThinkAct: Vision-Language-Action Reasoning via Reinforced Visual Latent Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16815v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jasper0314-huang.github.io/thinkact-vla/</p></details> |
| **[Towards provable probabilistic safety for scalable embodied AI systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05171v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable embodied AI systems. Instead, empirical safety evaluation is employed as an alternative, but the absence of provable guarantees imposes significant limitations. To address these issues, we argue for a paradigm shift to provable probabilistic safety that integrates provable guarantees with progressive achievement toward a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance. The new paradigm better leverages statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability, and a well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be deployed at scale. In this Perspective, we outline a roadmap for provable probabilistic safety, along with corresponding challenges and potential solutions. By bridging the gap between theoretical safety assurance and practical deployment, this Perspective offers a pathway toward safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical applications.</p></details> |  |

Unlike offline video understanding, streaming video understanding requires the ability to process video streams frame by frame, preserve historical information, and make low-latency decisions. To address these challenges, our main contributions are three-fold. (i) We develop a novel streaming video backbone, termed as StreamFormer, by incorporating causal temporal attention into a pre-trained vision transformer. This enables efficient streaming video processing while maintaining image representation capability. (ii) To train StreamFormer, we propose to unify diverse spatial-temporal video understanding tasks within a multitask visual-language alignment framework. Hence, StreamFormer learns global semantics, temporal dynamics, and fine-grained spatial relationships simultaneously. (iii) We conduct extensive experiments on online action detection, online video instance segmentation, and video question answering. StreamFormer achieves competitive results while maintaining efficiency, demonstrating its potential for real-time applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

PR2 offers high-quality scene rendering and robot dynamic simulation, enabling (i) the creation of diverse scenes using various digital assets, (ii) the integration of advanced perception or foundation models, and (iii) the implementation of planning and control algorithms for dynamic humanoid robot behaviors based on environmental feedback. The beta version of PR2 has been deployed for the simulation track of a nationwide full-size humanoid robot competition for college students, attracting 137 teams and over 400 participants within four months. This competition covered traditional tasks in bipedal walking, as well as novel challenges in loco-manipulation and language-instruction-based object search, marking a first for public college robotics competitions. A retrospective analysis of the competition suggests that future events should emphasize the integration of locomotion with manipulation and perception. By making the PR2 testbed publicly available at https://github.com/pr2-humanoid/PR2-Platform, we aim to further advance education and training in humanoid robotics.

| **[EgoPrune: Efficient Token Pruning for Egomotion Video Reasoning in Embodied Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15428v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egomotion videos are first-person recordings where the view changes continuously due to the agent's movement. As they serve as the primary visual input for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient is therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, but their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video inputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person videos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints inherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a training-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning. EgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR for temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering (PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and removes redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token selector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame diversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune consistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning ratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover, we deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB edge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for on-device egomotion video reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Existing 3D generation primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models, the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we propose \textbf{PhysX-3D}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material, affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models, which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2) Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research in generative physical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://physx-3d.github.io/</p></details> |

Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

As a result, we are seeing similar advancements in embodied AI and robotics for control policy generation. Our review paper examines the integration of generative AI models with RL to advance robotics. Our primary focus is on the duality between generative AI and RL for robotics downstream tasks. Specifically, we investigate: (1) The role of prominent generative AI tools as modular priors for multi-modal input fusion in RL tasks. (2) How RL can train, fine-tune and distill generative models for policy generation, such as VLA models, similarly to RL applications in large language models. We then propose a new taxonomy based on a considerable amount of selected papers. Lastly, we identify open challenges accounting for model scalability, adaptation and grounding, giving recommendations and insights on future research directions. We reflect on which generative AI models best fit the RL tasks and why. On the other side, we reflect on important issues inherent to RL-enhanced generative policies, such as safety concerns and failure modes, and what are the limitations of current methods.

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.

Embodied intelligence focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the physical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only advanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract cognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest. Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the integration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their complementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in intelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and internal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment. By synthesizing current progress and identifying open challenges, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the path toward more capable and generalizable embodied AI systems.

However, most navigation policies are sensitive to viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training method.</p></details> | Under review |

However, expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects, and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training. Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively activates more neuron values in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Reasoning for Embodied Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22050v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied planning requires agents to make coherent multi-step decisions based on dynamic visual observations and natural language goals. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) excel at static perception tasks, they struggle with the temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and commonsense grounding needed for planning in interactive environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that brings R1-style reasoning enhancement into embodied planning. We first distill a high-quality dataset from a powerful closed-source model and perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with structured decision-making priors. We then design a rule-based reward function tailored to multi-step action quality and optimize the policy via Generalized Reinforced Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our approach is evaluated on Embench, a recent benchmark for interactive embodied tasks, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms models of similar or larger scale, including GPT-4o-mini and 70B+ open-source baselines, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen environments. This work highlights the potential of reinforcement-driven reasoning to advance long-horizon planning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Long-term Point Tracking in the Foundation Model Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09217v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However, real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets, offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines. However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time. Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks, demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2501.18487</p></details> |

To tackle these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models.

| **[SURPRISE3D: A Dataset for Spatial Understanding and Reasoning in Complex 3D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07781v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world. Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research. Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite. S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic planning.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoramic images, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 48 sequences, both indoors and outdoors.

| **[A Neural Representation Framework with LLM-Driven Spatial Reasoning for Open-Vocabulary 3D Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06719v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical feature field. This field represents language and instance features using distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations, outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their spatial reasoning capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attribution Regularization for Multimodal Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02359v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal machine learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for integrating information from multiple modalities to enhance learning and decision-making processes. However, it is commonly observed that unimodal models outperform multimodal models, despite the latter having access to richer information. Additionally, the influence of a single modality often dominates the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions. The focus of this project lies in the video-audio domain, although the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved. By leveraging this regularization term, the proposed approach aims to mitigate the issue of unimodal dominance and improve the performance of multimodal machine learning systems. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed technique will be assessed. The findings of this research project have the potential to significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal machine learning and facilitate its application in various domains, including multimedia analysis, human-computer interaction, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |

Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture, neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated asset generation.

With PAPRLE, a user can change the arrangement of the robotic limbs, and control them using a variety of input devices, including puppeteers, gaming controllers, and VR-based interfaces. This versatility supports a wide range of teleoperation scenarios and promotes adaptability to different task requirements. To further enhance configurability, we introduce a pluggable puppeteer device that can be easily mounted and adapted to match the target robot configurations. PAPRLE supports bilateral teleoperation through these puppeteer devices, agnostic to the type or configuration of the follower robot. By supporting both joint-space and task-space control, the system provides real-time force feedback, improving user fidelity and physical interaction awareness. The modular design of PAPRLE facilitates novel spatial arrangements of the limbs and enables scalable data collection, thereby advancing research in embodied AI and learning-based control. We validate PAPRLE in various real-world settings, demonstrating its versatility across diverse combinations of leader devices and follower robots.

However, collecting such embodied data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner, a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap. It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74% compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by 89.91\%.

| **[Embodied AI Agents: Modeling the World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22355v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes our research on AI agents embodied in visual, virtual or physical forms, enabling them to interact with both users and their environments. These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices, and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings, which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents, allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-free Generation of Temporally Consistent Rewards from VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04789v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in embodied tasks such as goal decomposition and visual comprehension. However, providing accurate rewards for robotic manipulation without fine-tuning VLMs remains challenging due to the absence of domain-specific robotic knowledge in pre-trained datasets and high computational costs that hinder real-time applicability. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM, a novel training-free, temporally consistent framework that generates accurate rewards through tracking the status changes in VLM-derived subgoals. Specifically, our method first queries the VLM to establish spatially aware subgoals and an initial completion estimate before each round of interaction. We then employ a Bayesian tracking algorithm to update the goal completion status dynamically, using subgoal hidden states to generate structured rewards for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. This approach enhances long-horizon decision-making and improves failure recovery capabilities with RL. Extensive experiments indicate that $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in two robot manipulation benchmarks, demonstrating superior reward accuracy with reduced computation consumption. We believe our approach not only advances reward generation techniques but also contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://t2-vlm.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimLauncher: Launching Sample-Efficient Real-world Robotic Reinforcement Learning via Simulation Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04452v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous learning of dexterous, long-horizon robotic skills has been a longstanding pursuit of embodied AI. Recent advances in robotic reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable performance and robustness in real-world visuomotor control tasks. However, applying RL in the real world faces challenges such as low sample efficiency, slow exploration, and significant reliance on human intervention. In contrast, simulators offer a safe and efficient environment for extensive exploration and data collection, while the visual sim-to-real gap, often a limiting factor, can be mitigated using real-to-sim techniques. Building on these, we propose SimLauncher, a novel framework that combines the strengths of real-world RL and real-to-sim-to-real approaches to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we first pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment, which then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values using extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived from pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from the pre-trained policy for better exploration. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multi-stage, contact-rich, and dexterous hand manipulation tasks. Compared to prior real-world RL approaches, SimLauncher significantly improves sample efficiency and achieves near-perfect success rates. We hope this work serves as a proof of concept and inspires further research on leveraging large-scale simulation pre-training to benefit real-world robotic RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic 3D Scene Generation with Spatially Contextualized VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20129v3)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints. Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.

While single-arm systems have shown strong task performance, collaborative dual-arm systems are essential for handling more intricate tasks involving rigid, deformable, and tactile-sensitive objects. To advance this goal, we launched the RoboTwin Dual-Arm Collaboration Challenge at the 2nd MEIS Workshop, CVPR 2025. Built on the RoboTwin Simulation platform (1.0 and 2.0) and the AgileX COBOT-Magic Robot platform, the competition consisted of three stages: Simulation Round 1, Simulation Round 2, and a final Real-World Round. Participants totally tackled 17 dual-arm manipulation tasks, covering rigid, deformable, and tactile-based scenarios. The challenge attracted 64 global teams and over 400 participants, producing top-performing solutions like SEM and AnchorDP3 and generating valuable insights into generalizable bimanual policy learning. This report outlines the competition setup, task design, evaluation methodology, key findings and future direction, aiming to support future research on robust and generalizable bimanual manipulation policies.

Existing techniques generatively re-render the input video to realize the transfer, such as video relighting models and conditioned world generation models. Nevertheless, these models are predominantly limited to the domain of training data (e.g., portrait) or fall into the bottleneck of temporal consistency and computation efficiency, especially when the input video involves complex dynamics and long durations. In this paper, we propose TC-Light, a novel generative renderer to overcome these problems. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark. Extensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible re-rendering results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.

Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose estimation from reward for navigation alone. In a large study we investigate the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking, space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings, leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extend. We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.</p></details> |  |

Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets and algorithms approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered in the research field. In this work, we address this shortcoming by introducing: (1) Articulate3D, an expertly curated 3D dataset featuring high-quality manual annotations on 280 indoor scenes. Articulate3D provides 8 types of annotations for articulated objects, covering parts and detailed motion information, all stored in a standardized scene representation format designed for scalable 3D content creation, exchange and seamless integration into simulation environments. (2) USDNet, a novel unified framework capable of simultaneously predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes for articulated objects. We evaluate USDNet on Articulate3D as well as two existing datasets, demonstrating the advantage of our unified dense prediction approach. Furthermore, we highlight the value of Articulate3D through cross-dataset and cross-domain evaluations and showcase its applicability in downstream tasks such as scene editing through LLM prompting and robotic policy training for articulated object manipulation. We provide open access to our dataset, benchmark, and method's source code.</p></details> |  |

As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats, which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused, local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art.

Current language model-based navigation systems operate on discrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node connections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams into continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by DeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego dataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling to balance historical and current observations. While large language models can supervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level control. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with expert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced with a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights multi-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong performance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied navigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient, reward-driven post-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: vlnr1.github.io</p></details> |

While early efforts focused on 2D visual perception and simulation, recent 3D-aware generative world models have demonstrated the ability to synthesize geometrically consistent, interactive 3D environments, marking a shift toward 3D spatial cognition. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks systematic analysis to categorize emerging techniques and clarify their roles in advancing 3D cognitive world models. This survey addresses this need by introducing a conceptual framework, providing a structured and forward-looking review of world models transitioning from 2D perception to 3D cognition. Within this framework, we highlight two key technological drivers, particularly advances in 3D representations and the incorporation of world knowledge, as fundamental pillars. Building on these, we dissect three core cognitive capabilities that underpin 3D world modeling: 3D physical scene generation, 3D spatial reasoning, and 3D spatial interaction. We further examine the deployment of these capabilities in real-world applications, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, digital twin, and gaming/VR. Finally, we identify challenges across data, modeling, and deployment, and outline future directions for advancing more robust and generalizable 3D world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Multi-sensor Fusion Perception for Embodied AI: Background, Methods, Challenges and Prospects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19769v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-sensor fusion perception (MSFP) is a key technology for embodied AI, which can serve a variety of downstream tasks (e.g., 3D object detection and semantic segmentation) and application scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving and swarm robotics). Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion, while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods. A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

The recent rise of AI scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning, and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration, and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven science.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce InternSpatial, the largest open-source dataset for spatial reasoning in VLMs, along with InternSpatial-Bench, a corresponding evaluation benchmark designed to assess spatial understanding under diverse instruction formats. InternSpatial comprises 12 million QA pairs spanning both single-view and multi-view settings, drawn from diverse visual environments and supporting 19 instruction formats that reflect varied query styles. For evaluation, we propose InternSpatial-Bench for single-view tasks and expand multi-view reasoning by introducing a novel rotation angle prediction task that has not been explored in prior work. Experimental results show that models trained on InternSpatial achieve 12.1% improvement on InternSpatial-Bench and 10.7% on VSI-Bench, while maintaining strong performance on general-purpose benchmarks. We hope these resources will support the development of spatially capable VLMs in practical applications such as robotics and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, evaluating their rollouts remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable, semantics-aware evaluator for world models.</p></details> |  |

Through the use of sensors for input and actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges presented by real-world applications. To fill this gap and foster further development in the field, this paper reviews the current state of research, analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions, providing insights to guide innovation and progress in this field.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in simulation platforms have greatly enhanced task diversity to train embodied Vision Language Models (VLMs), most platforms rely on simplified robot morphologies and bypass the stochastic nature of low-level execution, which limits their transferability to real-world robots. To address these issues, we present a physics-based simulation platform DualTHOR for complex dual-arm humanoid robots, built upon an extended version of AI2-THOR. Our simulator includes real-world robot assets, a task suite for dual-arm collaboration, and inverse kinematics solvers for humanoid robots. We also introduce a contingency mechanism that incorporates potential failures through physics-based low-level execution, bridging the gap to real-world scenarios. Our simulator enables a more comprehensive evaluation of the robustness and generalization of VLMs in household environments. Extensive evaluations reveal that current VLMs struggle with dual-arm coordination and exhibit limited robustness in realistic environments with contingencies, highlighting the importance of using our simulator to develop more capable VLMs for embodied tasks.

Across diverse settings within Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality, introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

Despite the progress made by existing methods, these methods often present some common challenges. First, they rely on pre-trained backbone models for visual perception, which struggle with the dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios. Second, the performance is limited when using pre-trained LLMs or VLMs without fine-tuning, due to the absence of VLN domain knowledge. Third, while fine-tuning LLMs and VLMs can improve results, their computational costs are higher than those without fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning (WPCL), a method that enhances an agent's ability to identify objects from dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios by effectively integrating pre-trained VLM knowledge into the perception process, without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Our method enhances the agent's ability to interpret and respond to environmental cues while ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results have shown that our method outperforms the baseline methods on multiple benchmarks, which validate the effectiveness, robustness and generalizability of our method.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in robotic hardware and embodied AI have expanded their capabilities, current systems still struggle with handling thin, flat, and deformable objects such as paper and fabric. This limitation arises from the lack of suitable perception techniques for robust state estimation under diverse object appearances, as well as the absence of planning techniques for generating appropriate grasp motions. To bridge these gaps, this paper introduces PP-Tac, a robotic system for picking up paper-like objects. PP-Tac features a multi-fingered robotic hand with high-resolution omnidirectional tactile sensors \sensorname. This hardware configuration enables real-time slip detection and online frictional force control that mitigates such slips. Furthermore, grasp motion generation is achieved through a trajectory synthesis pipeline, which first constructs a dataset of finger's pinching motions. Based on this dataset, a diffusion-based policy is trained to control the hand-arm robotic system. Experiments demonstrate that PP-Tac can effectively grasp paper-like objects of varying material, thickness, and stiffness, achieving an overall success rate of 87.5\%. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to grasp paper-like deformable objects using a tactile dexterous hand.

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges.

The diversity, realism, low cost accessibility and affordability of 3D data assets are critical for achieving generalization and scalability in embodied AI. However, most current embodied intelligence tasks still rely heavily on traditional 3D computer graphics assets manually created and annotated, which suffer from high production costs and limited realism. These limitations significantly hinder the scalability of data driven approaches. We present EmbodiedGen, a foundational platform for interactive 3D world generation. It enables the scalable generation of high-quality, controllable and photorealistic 3D assets with accurate physical properties and real-world scale in the Unified Robotics Description Format (URDF) at low cost. These assets can be directly imported into various physics simulation engines for fine-grained physical control, supporting downstream tasks in training and evaluation. EmbodiedGen is an easy-to-use, full-featured toolkit composed of six key modules: Image-to-3D, Text-to-3D, Texture Generation, Articulated Object Generation, Scene Generation and Layout Generation. EmbodiedGen generates diverse and interactive 3D worlds composed of generative 3D assets, leveraging generative AI to address the challenges of generalization and evaluation to the needs of embodied intelligence related research.

Although recent latent action policy optimization (LAPO) has shown promise in inferring proxy-action labels from visual observations, its performance degrades significantly when distractors are present. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric latent action learning framework that centers on objects rather than pixels. We leverage self-supervised object-centric pretraining to disentangle action-related and distracting dynamics. This allows LAPO to focus on task-relevant interactions, resulting in more robust proxy-action labels, enabling better imitation learning and efficient adaptation of the agent with just a few action-labeled trajectories. We evaluated our method in eight visually complex tasks across the Distracting Control Suite (DCS) and Distracting MetaWorld (DMW). Our results show that object-centric pretraining mitigates the negative effects of distractors by 50%, as measured by downstream task performance: average return (DCS) and success rate (DMW).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Workshop on World Models at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025, Poster, Project Page: https://laom.dunnolab.ai/, Source code: https://github.com/dunnolab/laom</p></details> |
| **[A Navigation Framework Utilizing Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10172v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[OctoNav: Towards Generalist Embodied Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09839v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents, which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1. Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1, we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e., Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically, we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability. Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Analytic Task Scheduler: Recursive Least Squares Based Method for Continual Learning in Embodied Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09623v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied foundation models are crucial for Artificial Intelligence (AI) interacting with the physical world by integrating multi-modal inputs, such as proprioception, vision and language, to understand human intentions and generate actions to control robots. While these models demonstrate strong generalization and few-shot learning capabilities, they face significant challenges in continually acquiring new skills without forgetting previously learned skills, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose the Analytic Task Scheduler (ATS), a novel framework for continual learning in embodied foundation models. ATS consists of a task-specific model library, where each model is fine-tuned independently on a single task, and an analytic scheduler trained using recursive least squares (RLS) to learn the mapping between language instructions and task-specific models. This architecture enables accurate task recognition and dynamic model selection while fundamentally avoiding parameter interference across tasks. The scheduler updates its parameters incrementally using only statistics (autocorrelation and cross-correlation matrices), enabling forgetting-resistant learning without the need to revisit historical data. We validate ATS on a real-world robot platform (RM65B), demonstrating superior resistance to forgetting and strong adaptability to task variations. The results highlight ATS as an effective, scalable, and deployable solution for continual learning in embodied foundation models operating in complex, dynamic environments. Our code will be available at https://github.com/MIAA-Embodied-AI/AnalyticTaskScheduler</p></details> |  |
| **[What Can RL Bring to VLA Generalization? An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://faceong.github.io/VIKI-R/</p></details> |

Understanding their kinematic structure and reconstructing them have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. However, current methods require carefully captured data for training or inference, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable reconstruction of articulated objects. We focus on reconstruction of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to acquire at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is quite challenging, as the object and camera move simultaneously and there are significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a 20$\times$ larger synthetic dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories. We compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Experiments show that our method can reconstruct synthetic and real articulated objects across different categories from dynamic RGBD videos, outperforming existing methods significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website can be found at https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/video2articulation/</p></details> |

We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability, minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance embodied agent training.

Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations.

| **[LLM-driven Indoor Scene Layout Generation via Scaled Human-aligned Data Synthesis and Multi-Stage Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07570v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches such as Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes. Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such as drones and mobile robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025 Embodied AI Workshop</p></details> |

Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate, and this trend is strongly evident in manipulation tasks. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots for manipulation tasks are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes \textsc{Corki}\xspace, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI-powered robotic manipulation applications. We aim to decouple LLM inference, robotic control, and data communication in the embodied AI robots' compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, \textsc{Corki}\xspace predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. \textsc{Corki}\xspace largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to $5.1\times$, resulting in up to $5.9\times$ speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 13.9\%.</p></details> |  |

Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence (maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21 held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed. Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors for scalable open-world visual understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset. Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://directlayout.github.io/</p></details> |

Existing per-scene optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.</p></details> |  |

This full-actuation architecture enables precise bidirectional kinematic calculations, substantially enhancing kinematic retargeting fidelity between the exoskeleton and robotic hand.

We begin with a practical challenge: training a cross-morphology embodied AI policy that generalizes across diverse robot morphologies. We formalize this as the Heterogeneous Embodied Agent Training (HEAT) problem and prove it reduces to a structured Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that is PSPACE-complete. This result explains why current reinforcement learning pipelines break down under morphological diversity, due to sequential training constraints, memory-policy coupling, and data incompatibility. We further explore Collective Adaptation, a distributed learning alternative inspired by biological systems. Though NEXP-complete in theory, it offers meaningful scalability and deployment benefits in practice. This work illustrates how computational theory can illuminate system design trade-offs and guide the development of more robust, scalable embodied AI. For practitioners and researchers to explore this problem, the implementation code of this work has been made publicly available at https://github.com/airs-admin/HEAT</p></details> |  |

Traditional learning-based methods rely heavily on large-scale annotated data or require extensive interaction with the environment in a reinforcement learning setting, often failing to generalize to novel environments and limiting scalability. To overcome these challenges, we explore a zero-shot setting where the agent operates without task-specific training, enabling more scalable and adaptable solution. Recent advances in Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) offer powerful capabilities for visual understanding and reasoning, making them ideal for agents to comprehend scenes, identify relevant regions, and infer the likely locations of objects. In this work, we present a zero-shot object goal navigation framework that integrates the perceptual strength of VFMs with a model-based planner that is capable of long-horizon decision making through frontier exploration. We evaluate our approach on the HM3D dataset using the Habitat simulator and demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of success weighted by path length for zero-shot object goal navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 workshop - Foundation Models Meet Embodied Agents</p></details> |

Specifically, Map and Locate involves generating a point cloud from an unposed video and segmenting object instances based on open-vocabulary queries. This task serves as a critical step toward real-world embodied AI applications and introduces a practical task that bridges reconstruction, recognition and reorganization. To tackle this task, we introduce a simple yet effective baseline, which we denote as SAB3R. Our approach builds upon MASt3R, a recent breakthrough in 3D computer vision, and incorporates a lightweight distillation strategy. This method transfers dense, per-pixel semantic features from 2D vision backbones (eg, CLIP and DINOv2) to enhance MASt3R's capabilities. Without introducing any auxiliary frozen networks, our model generates per-pixel semantic features and constructs cohesive point maps in a single forward pass. Compared to separately deploying MASt3R and CLIP, our unified model, SAB3R, achieves superior performance on the Map and Locate benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate SAB3R on both 2D semantic segmentation and 3D tasks to comprehensively validate its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>3D-LL...</summary><p>3D-LLM/VLA @ CVPR2025 | Project page: https://uva-computer-vision-lab.github.io/sab3r/</p></details> |

Following DeepSeek R1-Zero's approach, we directly tune using RL without any supervised fine-tuning phase on chain-of-thought (CoT) data. We evaluate EgoVLM on egocentric video question answering benchmarks and show that domain-specific training substantially improves performance over general-purpose VLMs. Our EgoVLM-3B, trained exclusively on non-CoT egocentric data, outperforms the base Qwen2.5-VL 3B and 7B models by 14.33 and 13.87 accuracy points on the EgoSchema benchmark, respectively. By explicitly generating reasoning traces, EgoVLM enhances interpretability, making it well-suited for downstream applications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel keyframe-based reward that incorporates salient frame selection to guide reinforcement learning optimization. This reward formulation opens a promising avenue for future exploration in temporally grounded egocentric reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our C...</summary><p>Our Code can be found at https://github.com/adityavavre/VidEgoVLM</p></details> |

We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient Online Tuning of VLM Agents via Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03792v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online fine-tuning vision-language model (VLM) agents with reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise for equipping agents with multi-step, goal-oriented capabilities in dynamic environments. However, their open-ended textual action space and non-end-to-end nature of action generation present significant challenges to effective online exploration in RL, e.g., explosion of the exploration space. We propose a novel online fine-tuning method, Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning (CoSo), better suited to the textual output space of VLM agents. Compared to prior methods that assign uniform uncertainty to all tokens, CoSo leverages counterfactual reasoning to dynamically assess the causal influence of individual tokens on post-processed actions. By prioritizing the exploration of action-critical tokens while reducing the impact of semantically redundant or low-impact tokens, CoSo enables a more targeted and efficient online rollout process. We provide theoretical analysis proving CoSo's convergence and policy improvement guarantees, and extensive empirical evaluations supporting CoSo's effectiveness. Our results across a diverse set of agent tasks, including Android device control, card gaming, and embodied AI, highlight its remarkable ability to enhance exploration efficiency and deliver consistent performance gains.

Recent learned approaches such as DUSt3R have shown impressive performance in multiview settings. However, these models treat images as unstructured collections, limiting effectiveness in scenarios where frames are captured from synchronized rigs with known or inferable structure. To this end, we introduce Rig3R, a generalization of prior multiview reconstruction models that incorporates rig structure when available, and learns to infer it when not. Rig3R conditions on optional rig metadata including camera ID, time, and rig poses to develop a rig-aware latent space that remains robust to missing information. It jointly predicts pointmaps and two types of raymaps: a pose raymap relative to a global frame, and a rig raymap relative to a rig-centric frame consistent across time. Rig raymaps allow the model to infer rig structure directly from input images when metadata is missing. Rig3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, camera pose estimation, and rig discovery, outperforming both traditional and learned methods by 17-45% mAA across diverse real-world rig datasets, all in a single forward pass without post-processing or iterative refinement.</p></details> |  |

While existing audio spatialization methods can generally map any available monaural audio to binaural audio signals, they often lack the flexible and interactive control needed in complex multi-object user-interactive environments. To address this, we propose a Text-guided Audio Spatialization (TAS) framework that utilizes flexible text prompts and evaluates our model from unified generation and comprehension perspectives. Due to the limited availability of premium and large-scale stereo data, we construct the SpatialTAS dataset, which encompasses 376,000 simulated binaural audio samples to facilitate the training of our model. Our model learns binaural differences guided by 3D spatial location and relative position prompts, augmented by flipped-channel audio. It outperforms existing methods on both simulated and real-recorded datasets, demonstrating superior generalization and accuracy. Besides, we develop an assessment model based on Llama-3.1-8B, which evaluates the spatial semantic coherence between our generated binaural audio and text prompts through a spatial reasoning task. Results demonstrate that text prompts provide flexible and interactive control to generate binaural audio with excellent quality and semantic consistency in spatial locations.

Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, i.e., pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the representation strategy. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multifaceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multimodal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions. We have also set up a Github repository to organize the papers included in this survey at: https://github.com/ChaofanTao/Autoregressive-Models-in-Vision-Survey.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted by TMLR</p></details> |

We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization. Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment. Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy. For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex, providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

While more robotics datasets are being created, the landscape of open data in the field is uneven. This is due to a lack of curation standards and consistent publication practices, which makes it difficult to discover, access, and reuse robotics data. To address these challenges, this paper presents a curation and access system with two main contributions: (1) a structured methodology to curate, publish, and integrate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) human-centered robotics datasets; and (2) a ChatGPT-powered conversational interface trained with the curated datasets metadata and documentation to enable exploration, comparison robotics datasets and data retrieval using natural language. Developed based on practical experience curating datasets from robotics labs within Texas Robotics at the University of Texas at Austin, the system demonstrates the value of standardized curation and persistent publication of robotics data. The system's evaluation suggests that access and understandability of human-robotics data are significantly improved. This work directly aligns with the goals of the HCRL @ ICRA 2025 workshop and represents a step towards more human-centered access to data for embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages (excluding references), 8 pages (including references); 5 figures; accepted to the ICRA 2025 Workshop on Human-Centered Robot Learning in the Era of Big Data and Large Models</p></details> |

Egocentric Spatial Reasoning in VLMs Across Disjoint Frames](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24257v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An embodied AI assistant operating on egocentric video must integrate spatial cues across time - for instance, determining where an object A, glimpsed a few moments ago lies relative to an object B encountered later. We introduce Disjoint-3DQA , a generative QA benchmark that evaluates this ability of VLMs by posing questions about object pairs that are not co-visible in the same frame. We evaluated seven state-of-the-art VLMs and found that models lag behind human performance by 28%, with steeper declines in accuracy (60% to 30 %) as the temporal gap widens. Our analysis further reveals that providing trajectories or bird's-eye-view projections to VLMs results in only marginal improvements, whereas providing oracle 3D coordinates leads to a substantial 20% performance increase. This highlights a core bottleneck of multi-frame VLMs in constructing and maintaining 3D scene representations over time from visual signals. Disjoint-3DQA therefore sets a clear, measurable challenge for long-horizon spatial reasoning and aims to catalyze future research at the intersection of vision, language, and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, many existing simulation frameworks typically support a narrow range of scenes/tasks and lack features critical for scaling generalizable robotics and sim2real. We introduce and open source ManiSkill3, the fastest state-visual GPU parallelized robotics simulator with contact-rich physics targeting generalizable manipulation. ManiSkill3 supports GPU parallelization of many aspects including simulation+rendering, heterogeneous simulation, pointclouds/voxels visual input, and more. Simulation with rendering on ManiSkill3 can run 10-1000x faster with 2-3x less GPU memory usage than other platforms, achieving up to 30,000+ FPS in benchmarked environments due to minimal python/pytorch overhead in the system, simulation on the GPU, and the use of the SAPIEN parallel rendering system. Tasks that used to take hours to train can now take minutes. We further provide the most comprehensive range of GPU parallelized environments/tasks spanning 12 distinct domains including but not limited to mobile manipulation for tasks such as drawing, humanoids, and dextrous manipulation in realistic scenes designed by artists or real-world digital twins. In addition, millions of demonstration frames are provided from motion planning, RL, and teleoperation. ManiSkill3 also provides a comprehensive set of baselines that span popular RL and learning-from-demonstrations algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://maniskill.ai/</p></details> |

Modeling hand-object interaction priors holds significant potential to advance robotic and embodied AI systems in learning to operate effectively within the physical world. We introduce SIGHT, a novel task focused on generating realistic and physically plausible 3D hand-object interaction trajectories from a single image and a brief language-based task description. Prior work on hand-object trajectory generation typically relies on textual input that lacks explicit grounding to the target object, or assumes access to 3D object meshes, which are often considerably more difficult to obtain than 2D images. We propose SIGHT-Fusion, a novel diffusion-based image-text conditioned generative model that tackles this task by retrieving the most similar 3D object mesh from a database and enforcing geometric hand-object interaction constraints via a novel inference-time diffusion guidance. We benchmark our model on the HOI4D and H2O datasets, adapting relevant baselines for this novel task. Experiments demonstrate our superior performance in the diversity and quality of generated trajectories, as well as in hand-object interaction geometry metrics.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches typically frame RE as a supervised learning problem, directly mapping context to labels-an approach that often suffers from poor out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. Inspired by the workflow of human annotators, we reframe RE as a reasoning task guided by annotation guidelines and introduce R1-RE, the first reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) framework for RE tasks. Our method elicits the reasoning abilities of small language models for annotation tasks, resulting in significantly improved OOD robustness. We evaluate our approach on the public Sem-2010 dataset and a private MDKG dataset. The R1-RE-7B model attains an average OOD accuracy of approximately 70%, on par with leading proprietary models such as GPT-4o. Additionally, our comprehensive analysis provides novel insights into the training dynamics and emergent reasoning behaviors of the RLVR paradigm for RE.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Self-Questioning Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03682v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating their own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM): an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated training datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Collaboration With Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04652v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges.</p></details> |  |

The aim is to dynamically select which feature to measure based on current observations, independently for each test instance. Common approaches either use Reinforcement Learning, which experiences training difficulties, or greedily maximize the conditional mutual information of the label and unobserved features, which makes myopic acquisitions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a latent variable model, trained in a supervised manner. Acquisitions are made by reasoning about the features across many possible unobserved realizations in a stochastic latent space. Extensive evaluation on a large range of synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that our approach reliably outperforms a diverse set of baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 15 figures, 17 tables, published at ICML 2025</p></details> |

Moreover, RLVR is prone to over-optimization, where LLMs exploit verification shortcuts without aligning to the actual intent of user instructions. We introduce Instruction Following Decorator (IFDecorator}, a framework that wraps RLVR training into a robust and sample-efficient pipeline. It consists of three components: (1) a cooperative-adversarial data flywheel that co-evolves instructions and hybrid verifications, generating progressively more challenging instruction-verification pairs; (2) IntentCheck, a bypass module enforcing intent alignment; and (3) trip wires, a diagnostic mechanism that detects reward hacking via trap instructions, which trigger and capture shortcut exploitation behaviors. Our Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator achieves 87.43% accuracy on IFEval, outperforming larger proprietary models such as GPT-4o. Additionally, we demonstrate substantial improvements on FollowBench while preserving general capabilities. Our trip wires show significant reductions in reward hacking rates. We will release models, code, and data for future research.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[RL-PLUS: Countering Capability Boundary Collapse of LLMs in Reinforcement Learning with Hybrid-policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00222v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of the base LLM, due to its essentially on-policy strategy coupled with LLM's immense action space and sparse reward. Critically, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization approach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance Sampling to address distributional mismatch from external data, and Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. Compared with existing RLVR methods, RL-PLUS achieves 1) state-of-the-art performance on six math reasoning benchmarks; 2) superior performance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks; 3) consistent and significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative improvements up to 69.2\%. Moreover, the analysis of Pass@k curves indicates that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Relative Ignorability Framework for Decision-Relevant Observability in Control Theory and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07722v6)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential decision-making systems routinely operate with missing or incomplete data. Classical reinforcement learning theory, which is commonly used to solve sequential decision problems, assumes Markovian observability, which may not hold under partial observability. Causal inference paradigms formalise ignorability of missingness. We show these views can be unified and generalized in order to guarantee Q-learning convergence even when the Markov property fails. To do so, we introduce the concept of relative ignorability. Relative ignorability is a graphical-causal criterion which refines the requirements for accurate decision-making based on incomplete data. Theoretical results and simulations both reveal that non-Markovian stochastic processes whose missingness is relatively ignorable with respect to causal estimands can still be optimized using standard Reinforcement Learning algorithms. These results expand the theoretical foundations of safe, data-efficient AI to real-world environments where complete information is unattainable.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAIDX: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation and GRPO Reinforcement Learning Framework for Explainable Deepfake Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04524v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of AI-generation models has enabled the creation of hyperrealistic imagery, posing ethical risks through widespread misinformation. Current deepfake detection methods, categorized as face specific detectors or general AI-generated detectors, lack transparency by framing detection as a classification task without explaining decisions. While several LLM-based approaches offer explainability, they suffer from coarse-grained analyses and dependency on labor-intensive annotations. This paper introduces RAIDX (Retrieval-Augmented Image Deepfake Detection and Explainability), a novel deepfake detection framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance detection accuracy and decision explainability. Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate external knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to autonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps, eliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and providing interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency maps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing transparency in deepfake identification. RAIDX represents the first unified framework to synergize RAG and GRPO, addressing critical gaps in accuracy and explainability. Our code and models will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Sufficiency to Reflection: Reinforcement-Guided Thinking Quality in Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22716v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most rely only on final-answer rewards, overlooking intermediate reasoning quality. This paper analyzes existing RAG reasoning models and identifies three main failure patterns: (1) information insufficiency, meaning the model fails to retrieve adequate support; (2) faulty reasoning, where logical or content-level flaws appear despite sufficient information; and (3) answer-reasoning inconsistency, where a valid reasoning chain leads to a mismatched final answer. We propose TIRESRAG-R1, a novel framework using a think-retrieve-reflect process and a multi-dimensional reward system to improve reasoning and stability. TIRESRAG-R1 introduces: (1) a sufficiency reward to encourage thorough retrieval; (2) a reasoning quality reward to assess the rationality and accuracy of the reasoning chain; and (3) a reflection reward to detect and revise errors. It also employs a difficulty-aware reweighting strategy and training sample filtering to boost performance on complex tasks. Experiments on four multi-hop QA datasets show that TIRESRAG-R1 outperforms prior RAG methods and generalizes well to single-hop tasks. The code and data are available at: https://github.com/probe2/TIRESRAG-R1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Reflection with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04495v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, they struggle with robust causal reasoning, often relying on spurious correlations and brittle patterns. Similarly, traditional Reinforcement Learning agents also lack causal understanding, optimizing for rewards without modeling why actions lead to outcomes. We introduce Causal Reflection, a framework that explicitly models causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation, enabling agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects. Additionally, we define a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted and observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's internal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners, but as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into natural language explanations and counterfactuals. Our framework lays the theoretical groundwork for Causal Reflective agents that can adapt, self-correct, and communicate causal understanding in evolving environments.</p></details> |  |

We consider a system where multiple sensing agents (SAs) observe a source characterized by various attributes and provide updates to multiple actuation agents (AAs), which act upon the received information to fulfill their heterogeneous goals at the endpoint. A hub serves as an intermediary, querying the SAs for updates on observed attributes and maintaining a knowledge base, which is then broadcast to the AAs. The AAs leverage the knowledge to perform their actions effectively. To quantify the semantic value of updates, we introduce a grade of effectiveness (GoE) metric. Furthermore, we integrate cumulative perspective theory (CPT) into the long-term effectiveness analysis to account for risk awareness and loss aversion in the system. Leveraging this framework, we compute effect-aware scheduling policies aimed at maximizing the expected discounted sum of CPT-based total GoE provided by the transmitted updates while complying with a given query cost constraint. To achieve this, we propose a model-based solution based on dynamic programming and model-free solutions employing state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. Our findings demonstrate that effect-aware scheduling significantly enhances the effectiveness of communicated updates compared to benchmark scheduling methods, particularly in settings with stringent cost constraints where optimal query scheduling is vital for system performance and overall effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Automatic LLM Red Teaming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04451v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Red teaming is critical for identifying vulnerabilities and building trust in current LLMs. However, current automated methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on brittle prompt templates or single-turn attacks, failing to capture the complex, interactive nature of real-world adversarial dialogues. We propose a novel paradigm: training an AI to strategically `break' another AI. By formalizing red teaming as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employing a hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we effectively address the inherent sparse reward and long-horizon challenges. Our generative agent learns coherent, multi-turn attack strategies through a fine-grained, token-level harm reward, enabling it to uncover subtle vulnerabilities missed by existing baselines. This approach sets a new state-of-the-art, fundamentally reframing LLM red teaming as a dynamic, trajectory-based process (rather than a one-step test) essential for robust AI deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization with Preemptive Penalty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01883v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) often faces significant issues such as constraint violations and instability, necessitating the use of constrained policy optimization, which seeks optimal policies while ensuring adherence to specific constraints like safety. Typically, constrained optimization problems are addressed by the Lagrangian method, a post-violation remedial approach that may result in oscillations and overshoots. Motivated by this, we propose a novel method named Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO) that incorporates a preemptive penalty mechanism. This mechanism integrates barrier items into the objective function as the policy nears the boundary, imposing a cost. Meanwhile, we introduce a constraint-aware intrinsic reward to guide boundary-aware exploration, which is activated only when the policy approaches the constraint boundary. We establish theoretical upper and lower bounds for the duality gap and the performance of the PCPO update, shedding light on the method's convergence characteristics. Additionally, to enhance the optimization performance, we adopt a policy iteration approach. An interesting finding is that PCPO demonstrates significant stability in experiments. Experimental results indicate that the PCPO framework provides a robust solution for policy optimization under constraints, with important implications for future research and practical applications.</p></details> |  |

By analyzing the parallel actions in the multi-vehicle joint action space in the partial-steady-state traffic flow, the parallel update method can quickly exclude potential dangerous actions, thereby increasing the search depth without sacrificing the search breadth. The proposed method is tested in a large number of randomly generated traffic flow. The experiment results show that the algorithm has good robustness and better performance than the SOTA reinforcement learning algorithms and heuristic methods. The vehicle driving strategy using the proposed algorithm shows rationality beyond human drivers, and has advantages in traffic efficiency and safety in the coordinating zone.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.04295 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Thinking With Videos: Multimodal Tool-Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Long Video Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04416v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The video reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is crucial for downstream tasks like video question answering and temporal grounding. While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video scenarios. All code, data and model weight will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

However, as MLLMs continue to advance and even cover GUI domains during pretraining, the necessity of exhaustive SFT post-training becomes increasingly questionable. Meanwhile, recent successes of rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) suggest a more efficient alternative. Despite this promise, the optimal manner of applying RFT for GUI-VG remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GuirlVG, a reinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method built on a systematic empirical study and a novel stabilization technique. We find that naive application of RFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we decompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of each. Second, we propose a novel Adversarial KL Factor that dynamically stabilizes training to mitigate reward over-optimization. Third, we further explore the training configurations of RFT to enhance effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that GuirlVG, with only 5.2K training samples, outperforms SFT methods trained on over 10M samples, achieving a 7.7% improvement on ScreenSpot, a 17.2% improvement on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% accuracy on ScreenSpotV2.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[TSPO: Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization for Long-form Video Language Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04369v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when processing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs' context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before feeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform sampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained by the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile, building a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient rule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long video training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and video Needle-in-a-Haystack data. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge Video-MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Exploration with PAC-Bayes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03055v4)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous control under delayed rewards is an under-explored problem despite its significance in real-world applications. Many complex skills are based on intermediate ones as prerequisites. For instance, a humanoid locomotor must learn how to stand before it can learn to walk. To cope with delayed reward, an agent must perform deep exploration. However, existing deep exploration methods are designed for small discrete action spaces, and their generalization to state-of-the-art continuous control remains unproven. We address the deep exploration problem for the first time from a PAC-Bayesian perspective in the context of actor-critic learning. To do this, we quantify the error of the Bellman operator through a PAC-Bayes bound, where a bootstrapped ensemble of critic networks represents the posterior distribution, and their targets serve as a data-informed function-space prior. We derive an objective function from this bound and use it to train the critic ensemble. Each critic trains an individual soft actor network, implemented as a shared trunk and critic-specific heads. The agent performs deep exploration by acting epsilon-softly on a randomly chosen actor head. Our proposed algorithm, named {\it PAC-Bayesian Actor-Critic (PBAC)}, is the only algorithm to consistently discover delayed rewards on continuous control tasks with varying difficulty.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECAI ...</summary><p>ECAI camera-ready version</p></details> |
| **[GTPO and GRPO-S: Token and Sequence-Level Reward Shaping with Policy Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04349v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) improves Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, but is limited by a coarse-grained credit assignment that applies a uniform reward to all tokens in a sequence. This is a major flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks. This paper solves this with \textbf{Dynamic Entropy Weighting}. Our core idea is that high-entropy tokens in correct responses can guide the policy toward a higher performance ceiling. This allows us to create more fine-grained reward signals for precise policy updates via two ways: 1) \textbf{Group Token Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GTPO}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each token for fine-grained credit assignment. 2) \textbf{Sequence-Level Group Relative Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GRPO-S}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each sequence based on its average token entropy. Experiments show our methods significantly outperform the strong DAPO baseline. The results confirm that our entropy-weighting mechanism is the key driver of this performance boost, offering a better path to enhance deep reasoning in models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Scheduling Algorithm for Scalable and Efficient IoT Sensing in Cloud Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04334v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices produces massive, heterogeneous data streams, demanding scalable and efficient scheduling in cloud environments to meet latency, energy, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. Existing scheduling methods often lack adaptability to dynamic workloads and network variability inherent in IoT-cloud systems. This paper presents a novel hybrid scheduling algorithm combining deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to address these challenges. The deep RL agent utilizes a model-free policy-gradient approach to learn adaptive task allocation policies responsive to real-time workload fluctuations and network states. Simultaneously, the ACO metaheuristic conducts a global combinatorial search to optimize resource distribution, mitigate congestion, and balance load across distributed cloud nodes. Extensive experiments on large-scale synthetic IoT datasets, reflecting diverse workloads and QoS constraints, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 18.4% reduction in average response time, 12.7% improvement in resource utilization, and 9.3% decrease in energy consumption compared to leading heuristics and RL-only baselines. Moreover, the algorithm ensures strict Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance through deadline-aware scheduling and dynamic prioritization. The results confirm the effectiveness of integrating model-free RL with swarm intelligence for scalable, energy-efficient IoT data scheduling, offering a promising approach for next-generation IoT-cloud platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[TempFlow-GRPO: When Timing Matters for GRPO in Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04324v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent flow matching models for text-to-image generation have achieved remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches: sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming, we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces two key innovations: (i) a trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; and (ii) a noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later phases. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art performance in human preference alignment and standard text-to-image benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

This makes it ideal for real-world robots and safety-critical scenarios, where collecting online data or expert demonstrations is slow, costly, and risky. However, most existing offline RL works assume the dataset is already labeled with the task rewards, a process that often requires significant human effort, especially when ground-truth states are hard to ascertain (e.g., in the real-world). In this paper, we build on prior work, specifically RL-VLM-F, and propose a novel system that automatically generates reward labels for offline datasets using preference feedback from a vision-language model and a text description of the task. Our method then learns a policy using offline RL with the reward-labeled dataset. We demonstrate the system's applicability to a complex real-world robot-assisted dressing task, where we first learn a reward function using a vision-language model on a sub-optimal offline dataset, and then we use the learned reward to employ Implicit Q learning to develop an effective dressing policy. Our method also performs well in simulation tasks involving the manipulation of rigid and deformable objects, and significantly outperform baselines such as behavior cloning and inverse RL. In summary, we propose a new system that enables automatic reward labeling and policy learning from unlabeled, sub-optimal offline datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages.

| **[Challenges in Applying Variational Quantum Algorithms to Dynamic Satellite Network Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04288v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applying near-term variational quantum algorithms to the problem of dynamic satellite network routing represents a promising direction for quantum computing. In this work, we provide a critical evaluation of two major approaches: static quantum optimizers such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for offline route computation, and Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) methods for online decision-making. Using ideal, noise-free simulations, we find that these algorithms face significant challenges. Specifically, static optimizers are unable to solve even a classically easy 4-node shortest path problem due to the complexity of the optimization landscape. Likewise, a basic QRL agent based on policy gradient methods fails to learn a useful routing strategy in a dynamic 8-node environment and performs no better than random actions. These negative findings highlight key obstacles that must be addressed before quantum algorithms can offer real advantages in communication networks. We discuss the underlying causes of these limitations, including barren plateaus and learning instability, and suggest future research directions to overcome them.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages and 3 figures</p></details> |

While many benchmarks incorporate sufficiently complex real-world problems, they lack controllability over the degree of challenges posed to memory models. In contrast, synthetic environments enable fine-grained manipulation of dynamics, making them critical for detailed and rigorous evaluation of memory-augmented RL. Our study focuses on POMDP synthesis with three key contributions: 1. A theoretical framework for analyzing POMDPs, grounded in Memory Demand Structure (MDS), transition invariance, and related concepts; 2. A methodology leveraging linear process dynamics, state aggregation, and reward redistribution to construct customized POMDPs with predefined properties; 3. Empirically validated series of POMDP environments with increasing difficulty levels, designed based on our theoretical insights. Our work clarifies the challenges of memory-augmented RL in solving POMDPs, provides guidelines for analyzing and designing POMDP environments, and offers empirical support for selecting memory models in RL tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Vision-Language Model Training with Reinforcement Learning in Synthetic Worlds for Real-World Success](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04280v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive multimodal agents must convert raw visual observations into coherent sequences of language-conditioned actions -- a capability that current vision-language models (VLMs) still lack. Earlier reinforcement-learning (RL) efforts could, in principle, endow VLMs with such skills, but they have seldom tested whether the learned behaviours generalize beyond their training simulators, and they depend either on brittle hyperparameter tuning or on dense-reward environments with low state variability. We introduce Vision-Language Decoupled Actor-Critic (VL-DAC), a lightweight, hyperparameter-free RL algorithm. VL-DAC applies PPO updates to action tokens while learning value only at the environment-step level: an arrangement, to our knowledge, not previously explored for large VLMs or LLMs. This simple decoupling removes unstable weighting terms and yields faster, more reliable convergence. Training a single VLM with VL-DAC in one inexpensive simulator at a time (MiniWorld, Gym-Cards, ALFWorld, or WebShop) already produces policies that generalize widely: +50\% relative on BALROG (game-centric agentic control), +5\% relative on the hardest part of VSI-Bench (spatial planning), and +2\% on VisualWebBench (web navigation), all without degrading general image understanding accuracy. These results provide the first evidence that a simple RL algorithm can train VLMs entirely in cheap synthetic worlds while delivering measurable gains on real-image agentic, spatial-reasoning, and web-navigation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, real-world users often pursue more complex goals, such as applying vouchers, managing budgets, and finding multi-products seller. To bridge this gap, we propose ShoppingBench, a novel end-to-end shopping benchmark designed to encompass increasingly challenging levels of grounded intent. Specifically, we propose a scalable framework to simulate user instructions based on various intents derived from sampled real-world products. To facilitate consistent and reliable evaluations, we provide a large-scale shopping sandbox that serves as an interactive simulated environment, incorporating over 2.5 million real-world products. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art language agents (such as GPT-4.1) achieve absolute success rates under 50% on our benchmark tasks, highlighting the significant challenges posed by our ShoppingBench. In addition, we propose a trajectory distillation strategy and leverage supervised fine-tuning, along with reinforcement learning on synthetic trajectories, to distill the capabilities of a large language agent into a smaller one. As a result, our trained agent achieves competitive performance compared to GPT-4.1.</p></details> | submit to AAAI2026 |

Despite significant efforts in this area, most existing methods primarily rely on prerequisite relationships, which present two major limitations: 1) Requiring prerequisite relationships between knowledge concepts, which are difficult to obtain due to the cost of expert annotation, hindering the application of current learning path recommendation methods. 2) Relying on a single, sequentially dependent knowledge structure based on prerequisite relationships implies that difficulties at any stage can cause learning blockages, which in turn disrupt subsequent learning processes. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, GraphRAG-Induced Dual Knowledge Structure Graphs for Personalized Learning Path Recommendation (KnowLP), which enhances learning path recommendations by incorporating both prerequisite and similarity relationships between knowledge concepts. Specifically, we introduce a knowledge concept structure graph generation module EDU-GraphRAG that adaptively constructs knowledge concept structure graphs for different educational datasets, significantly improving the generalizability of learning path recommendation methods. We then propose a Discrimination Learning-driven Reinforcement Learning (DLRL) module, which mitigates the issue of blocked learning paths, further enhancing the efficacy of learning path recommendations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also provides interpretable reasoning for the recommended learning paths.</p></details> |  |

Most recent efforts to reproduce zero RL training have primarily focused on the Qwen2.5 model series, which may not be representative as we find the base models already exhibit strong instruction-following and self-reflection abilities. In this work, we investigate zero RL training across 10 diverse base models, spanning different families and sizes including LLama3-8B, Mistral-7B/24B, DeepSeek-Math-7B, Qwen2.5-math-7B, and all Qwen2.5 models from 0.5B to 32B. Leveraging several key design strategies-such as adjusting format reward and controlling query difficulty-we achieve substantial improvements in both reasoning accuracy and response length across most settings. However, by carefully monitoring the training dynamics, we observe that different base models exhibit distinct patterns during training. For instance, the increased response length does not always correlate with the emergence of certain cognitive behaviors such as verification (i.e., the "aha moment"). Notably, we observe the "aha moment" for the first time in small models not from the Qwen family. We share the key designs that enable successful zero RL training, along with our findings and practices. To facilitate further research, we open-source the code, models, and analysis tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods based on specific multi-step reasoning datasets and reinforcement learning strategies, leading to high training costs and limited generalization. In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for enhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and reasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset dependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates grounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object localization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then builds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning accuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning path to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby reducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy. Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess whether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in enhancing reasoning reliability.</p></details> |  |

However, they may suffer from hallucinations--generating outputs that are semantically inconsistent with the input image or text. Through causal analyses, we find that: (i) hallucinations with omission may arise from the failure to adequately capture essential causal factors, and (ii) hallucinations with fabrication are likely caused by the model being misled by non-causal cues. To address these challenges, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework guided by causal completeness, which jointly considers both causal sufficiency and causal necessity of tokens. Specifically, we evaluate each token's standalone contribution and counterfactual indispensability to define a token-level causal completeness reward. This reward is used to construct a causally informed advantage function within the GRPO optimization framework, encouraging the model to focus on tokens that are both causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation. Experimental results across various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which effectively mitigates hallucinations in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Search and Recommendation through Latent Cross Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04152v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Search and recommendation (S&R) are fundamental components of modern online platforms, yet effectively leveraging search behaviors to improve recommendation remains a challenging problem. User search histories often contain noisy or irrelevant signals that can even degrade recommendation performance, while existing approaches typically encode S&R histories either jointly or separately without explicitly identifying which search behaviors are truly useful. Inspired by the human decision-making process, where one first identifies recommendation intent and then reasons about relevant evidence, we design a latent cross reasoning framework that first encodes user S&R histories to capture global interests and then iteratively reasons over search behaviors to extract signals beneficial for recommendation. Contrastive learning is employed to align latent reasoning states with target items, and reinforcement learning is further introduced to directly optimize ranking performance. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, validating the importance of reasoning in enhancing search-aware recommendation.</p></details> |  |

While methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are widely used, they often rely on large, costly preference datasets. The current work lacks methods for high-quality data selection specifically for preference data. In this work, we introduce a novel difficulty-based data selection strategy for preference datasets, grounded in the DPO implicit reward mechanism. By selecting preference data examples with smaller DPO implicit reward gaps, which are indicative of more challenging cases, we improve data efficiency and model alignment. Our approach consistently outperforms five strong baselines across multiple datasets and alignment tasks, achieving superior performance with only 10\% of the original data. This principled, efficient selection method offers a promising solution for scaling LLM alignment with limited resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Difficulty-Based-Preference-Data-Select/Difficulty-Based-Preference-Data-Select</p></details> |
| **[COPO: Consistency-Aware Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04138v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving tasks. Recently, the introduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging rule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions and guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across many replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses under a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or incorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to vanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for learning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization framework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome consistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs show high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives meaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and self-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we incorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances local advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic transitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method introduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization strategy. We validate its effectiveness through substantial performance gains on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, highlighting the proposed framework's robustness and general applicability.

However, many model-free RL algorithms experience performance degradation due to inaccurate value estimation, particularly the overestimation of Q-values, which can lead to suboptimal policies. To address this issue, we previously proposed the Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC or DSACv1), an off-policy RL algorithm that enhances value estimation accuracy by learning a continuous Gaussian value distribution. Despite its effectiveness, DSACv1 faces challenges such as training instability and sensitivity to reward scaling, caused by high variance in critic gradients due to return randomness. In this paper, we introduce three key refinements to DSACv1 to overcome these limitations and further improve Q-value estimation accuracy: expected value substitution, twin value distribution learning, and variance-based critic gradient adjustment. The enhanced algorithm, termed DSAC with Three refinements (DSAC-T or DSACv2), is systematically evaluated across a diverse set of benchmark tasks. Without the need for task-specific hyperparameter tuning, DSAC-T consistently matches or outperforms leading model-free RL algorithms, including SAC, TD3, DDPG, TRPO, and PPO, in all tested environments. Additionally, DSAC-T ensures a stable learning process and maintains robust performance across varying reward scales. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated through real-world application in controlling a wheeled robot, highlighting its potential for deployment in practical robotic tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Title...</summary><p>Title updated in this version.

| **[Why the Agent Made that Decision: Contrastive Explanation Learning for Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16120v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in solving complex decision-making problems, yet its adoption in critical domains is hindered by the lack of interpretability in its decision-making processes. Existing explainable AI (xAI) approaches often fail to provide meaningful explanations for RL agents, particularly because they overlook the contrastive nature of human reasoning--answering "why this action instead of that one?". To address this gap, we propose a novel framework of contrastive learning to explain RL selected actions, named $\textbf{VisionMask}$. VisionMask is trained to generate explanations by explicitly contrasting the agent's chosen action with alternative actions in a given state using a self-supervised manner. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through experiments across diverse RL environments, evaluating it in terms of faithfulness, robustness, and complexity. Our results show that VisionMask significantly improves human understanding of agent behavior while maintaining accuracy and fidelity. Furthermore, we present examples illustrating how VisionMask can be used for counterfactual analysis.

Dynamically adjusting the level of epistemic risk during the learning process can help to achieve reliable policies in safety-critical settings with better efficiency. In this work, we propose a new framework, Distributional RL with Online Risk Adaptation (DRL-ORA). This framework quantifies both epistemic and implicit aleatory uncertainties in a unified manner and dynamically adjusts the epistemic risk levels by solving a total variation minimization problem online. The framework unifies the existing variants of risk adaption approaches and offers better explainability and flexibility. The selection of risk levels is performed efficiently via a grid search using a Follow-The-Leader-type algorithm, where the offline oracle also corresponds to a ''satisficing measure'' under a specially modified loss function. We show that DRL-ORA outperforms existing methods that rely on fixed risk levels or manually designed risk level adaptation in multiple classes of tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLGS: Reinforcement Learning-Based Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning for Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04078v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperparameter tuning in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a labor-intensive and expert-driven process, often resulting in inconsistent reconstructions and suboptimal results. We propose RLGS, a plug-and-play reinforcement learning framework for adaptive hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS through lightweight policy modules, dynamically adjusting critical hyperparameters such as learning rates and densification thresholds. The framework is model-agnostic and seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS pipelines without architectural modifications. We demonstrate its generalization ability across multiple state-of-the-art 3DGS variants, including Taming-3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC, and validate its robustness across diverse datasets. RLGS consistently enhances rendering quality. For example, it improves Taming-3DGS by 0.7dB PSNR on the Tanks and Temple (TNT) dataset, under a fixed Gaussian budget, and continues to yield gains even when baseline performance saturates. Our results suggest that RLGS provides an effective and general solution for automating hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS training, bridging a gap in applying reinforcement learning to 3DGS.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

To simultaneously support two groups of users-energy receivers (ERs) and information receivers (IRs)-without sacrificing time-frequency resources, a subset of access points (APs) is dedicated to serving ERs with the aid of a BD-RIS, while the remaining APs focus on supporting IRs. A protective partial zero-forcing precoding technique is implemented at the APs to manage the non-coherent interference between the ERs and IRs. Subsequently, closed-form expressions for the spectral efficiency of the IRs and the average sum of harvested energy (HE) at the ERs are leveraged to formulate a comprehensive optimization problem. This problem jointly optimizes the AP selection, AP power control, and scattering matrix design at the BD-RIS, all based on long-term statistical channel state information. This challenging problem is then effectively transformed into more tractable forms. To solve these sub-problems, efficient algorithms are proposed, including a heuristic search for the scattering matrix design, as well as successive convex approximation and deep reinforcement learning methods for the joint AP mode selection and power control design. Numerical results show that a BD-RIS with a group-or fully-connected architecture achieves significant EH gains over the conventional diagonal RIS, especially delivering up to a 7-fold increase in the average sum of HE when a heuristic-based scattering matrix design is employed.

| **[Tool-integrated Reinforcement Learning for Repo Deep Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03012v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue localization, the process of identifying code locations that need modification to resolve software issues, is a critical yet challenging task in software development. The semantic gap between natural language issue descriptions and faulty code requires complex multi-hop reasoning through code dependencies. Existing LLM-based agents attempt to address this by integrating repository retrieval tools. However, this transforms issue localization into a demanding task we call Repo Deep Search, which requires the LLM to effectively utilize various repository retrieval tools throughout a multi-step reasoning and navigation process. To tackle this challenge, we present ToolTrain, a two-stage tool-integrated training framework combining rejection-sampled supervised fine-tuning and tool-integrated reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' ability to use retrieval tools for issue localization. Experimental results show that ToolTrain-trained models achieve state-of-the-art performance, with our 32B model even surpassing Claude-3.7 on function-level localization. The results also show that improved localization performance translates to better end-to-end issue resolution performance. This further demonstrates that training for issue localization is a viable and effective strategy for improving automated software development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emotion-o1: Adaptive Long Reasoning for Emotion Understanding in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22548v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has shown great promise in enhancing the emotion understanding performance of large language models (LLMs). However, current fixed-length CoT methods struggle to balance reasoning depth and efficiency. Simple tasks (e.g., sentiment classification) are over-reasoned, while complex tasks (e.g., sarcasm understanding) lack depth. To fill this gap, we present Emotion-o1, an adaptive CoT framework that dynamically adjusts reasoning length based on emotion-task complexity. Emotion-o1 is trained by distilling adaptive CoT patterns from a reasoning-oriented LLM, followed by supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with a four-part reward targeting accuracy, brevity, structure, and redundancy. Experimental results on four emotion tasks highlight: (1) Emotion-o1 demonstrates significant improvements over its backbone, with F1 score increases of 10%(Sentiment), 5%(Emotion), 18%(Humor), and 27%(Sarcasm). (2) In sentiment and sarcasm tasks, our 8B model demonstrates superior performance against advanced LLMs, outperforming Grok-3 by 1.1% and Claude-3.7 by 2%. (3) The framework maintains accuracy while reducing reasoning length by 83% compared to OpenAI-o1, demonstrating effective precision-efficiency optimization. Emotion-o1 effectively balances reasoning depth and efficiency for emotion understanding in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, the present agents' performance is far from being used. In this paper, we propose the Self-Evolution Agent (SEA) for computer use, and to develop this agent, we propose creative methods in data generation, reinforcement learning, and model enhancement. Specifically, we first propose an automatic pipeline to generate the verifiable trajectory for training. And then, we propose efficient step-wise reinforcement learning to alleviate the significant computational requirements for long-horizon training. In the end, we propose the enhancement method to merge the grounding and planning ability into one model without any extra training. Accordingly, based on our proposed innovation of data generation, training strategy, and enhancement, we get the Selfevolution Agent (SEA) for computer use with only 7B parameters, which outperforms models with the same number of parameters and has comparable performance to larger ones. We will make the models' weight and related codes open-source in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Portfolio Optimisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07694v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We evaluate benchmark deep reinforcement learning algorithms on the task of portfolio optimisation using simulated data. The simulator to generate the data is based on correlated geometric Brownian motion with the Bertsimas-Lo market impact model. Using the Kelly criterion (log utility) as the objective, we can analytically derive the optimal policy without market impact as an upper bound to measure performance when including market impact. We find that the off-policy algorithms DDPG, TD3 and SAC are unable to learn the right $Q$-function due to the noisy rewards and therefore perform poorly. The on-policy algorithms PPO and A2C, with the use of generalised advantage estimation, are able to deal with the noise and derive a close to optimal policy. The clipping variant of PPO was found to be important in preventing the policy from deviating from the optimal once converged. In a more challenging environment where we have regime changes in the GBM parameters, we find that PPO, combined with a hidden Markov model to learn and predict the regime context, is able to learn different policies adapted to each regime. Overall, we find that the sample complexity of these algorithms is too high for applications using real data, requiring more than 2m steps to learn a good policy in the simplest setting, which is equivalent to almost 8,000 years of daily prices.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Hierarchical Co-Optimization Framework for Coordinated Task Scheduling and Power Dispatch in Computing Power Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04015v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of large-scale artificial intelligence and data-intensive applications has spurred the development of Computing Power Networks (CPNs), which promise to deliver ubiquitous and on-demand computational resources. However, the immense energy consumption of these networks poses a significant sustainability challenge. Simultaneously, power grids are grappling with the instability introduced by the high penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES). This paper addresses these dual challenges through a novel Two-Stage Co-Optimization (TSCO) framework that synergistically manages power system dispatch and CPN task scheduling to achieve low-carbon operations. The framework decomposes the complex, large-scale problem into a day-ahead stochastic unit commitment (SUC) stage and a real-time operational stage. The former is solved using Benders decomposition for computational tractability, while in the latter, economic dispatch of generation assets is coupled with an adaptive CPN task scheduling managed by a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent. This agent makes intelligent, carbon-aware decisions by responding to dynamic grid conditions, including real-time electricity prices and marginal carbon intensity. Through extensive simulations on an IEEE 30-bus system integrated with a CPN, the TSCO framework is shown to significantly outperform baseline approaches. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces total carbon emissions and operational costs, while simultaneously decreasing RES curtailment by more than 60% and maintaining stringent Quality of Service (QoS) for computational tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Pivoting Manipulation with Force and Vision Feedback Using Optimization-based Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01082v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-prehensile manipulation is challenging due to complex contact interactions between objects, the environment, and robots. Model-based approaches can efficiently generate complex trajectories of robots and objects under contact constraints. However, they tend to be sensitive to model inaccuracies and require access to privileged information (e.g., object mass, size, pose), making them less suitable for novel objects. In contrast, learning-based approaches are typically more robust to modeling errors but require large amounts of data. In this paper, we bridge these two approaches to propose a framework for learning closed-loop pivoting manipulation. By leveraging computationally efficient Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization (CITO), we design demonstration-guided deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), leading to sample-efficient learning. We also present a sim-to-real transfer approach using a privileged training strategy, enabling the robot to perform pivoting manipulation using only proprioception, vision, and force sensing without access to privileged information. Our method is evaluated on several pivoting tasks, demonstrating that it can successfully perform sim-to-real transfer. The overview of our method and the hardware experiments are shown at https://youtu.be/akjGDgfwLbM?si=QVw6ExoPy2VsU2g6</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing Normalization Methods for Portfolio Optimization with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03910v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable results in various domains, including robotics, games, natural language processing, and finance. In the financial domain, this approach has been applied to tasks such as portfolio optimization, where an agent continuously adjusts the allocation of assets within a financial portfolio to maximize profit. Numerous studies have introduced new simulation environments, neural network architectures, and training algorithms for this purpose. Among these, a domain-specific policy gradient algorithm has gained significant attention in the research community for being lightweight, fast, and for outperforming other approaches. However, recent studies have shown that this algorithm can yield inconsistent results and underperform, especially when the portfolio does not consist of cryptocurrencies. One possible explanation for this issue is that the commonly used state normalization method may cause the agent to lose critical information about the true value of the assets being traded. This paper explores this hypothesis by evaluating two of the most widely used normalization methods across three different markets (IBOVESPA, NYSE, and cryptocurrencies) and comparing them with the standard practice of normalizing data before training. The results indicate that, in this specific domain, the state normalization can indeed degrade the agent's performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAMBO: RL-Augmented Model-Based Whole-Body Control for Loco-Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06662v4)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loco-manipulation, physical interaction of various objects that is concurrently coordinated with locomotion, remains a major challenge for legged robots due to the need for both precise end-effector control and robustness to unmodeled dynamics. While model-based controllers provide precise planning via online optimization, they are limited by model inaccuracies. In contrast, learning-based methods offer robustness, but they struggle with precise modulation of interaction forces. We introduce RAMBO, a hybrid framework that integrates model-based whole-body control within a feedback policy trained with reinforcement learning. The model-based module generates feedforward torques by solving a quadratic program, while the policy provides feedback corrective terms to enhance robustness. We validate our framework on a quadruped robot across a diverse set of real-world loco-manipulation tasks, such as pushing a shopping cart, balancing a plate, and holding soft objects, in both quadrupedal and bipedal walking. Our experiments demonstrate that RAMBO enables precise manipulation capabilities while achieving robust and dynamic locomotion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[Sotopia-RL: Reward Design for Social Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03905v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social intelligence has become a critical capability for large language models (LLMs), enabling them to engage effectively in real-world social tasks such as accommodation, persuasion, collaboration, and negotiation. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for training socially intelligent agents because it allows models to learn sophisticated strategies directly through social interactions. However, social interactions have two key characteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability, where utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit assignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as rapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal achievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL with single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To address these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines coarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards. Utterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by attributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards capture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking. Experiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate that Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17 on Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing approaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level credit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/sotopia-lab/sotopia-rl.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Reinforcement Learning in MDPs with Information-Ordered Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03904v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an epoch-based reinforcement learning algorithm for infinite-horizon average-cost Markov decision processes (MDPs) that leverages a partial order over a policy class. In this structure, $\pi' \leq \pi$ if data collected under $\pi$ can be used to estimate the performance of $\pi'$, enabling counterfactual inference without additional environment interaction. Leveraging this partial order, we show that our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{w \log(|\Theta|) T})$, where $w$ is the width of the partial order. Notably, the bound is independent of the state and action space sizes. We illustrate the applicability of these partial orders in many domains in operations research, including inventory control and queuing systems. For each, we apply our framework to that problem, yielding new theoretical guarantees and strong empirical results without imposing extra assumptions such as convexity in the inventory model or specialized arrival-rate structure in the queuing model.</p></details> | 57 pages, 2 figures |
| **[One Model, Any Conjunctive Query: Graph Neural Networks for Answering Queries over Incomplete Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13959v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the incompleteness of modern knowledge graphs, a new setup for query answering has emerged, where the goal is to predict answers that do not necessarily appear in the knowledge graph, but are present in its completion. In this paper, we formally introduce and study two query answering problems, namely, query answer classification and query answer retrieval. To solve these problems, we propose AnyCQ, a model that can classify answers to any conjunctive query on any knowledge graph. At the core of our framework lies a graph neural network trained using a reinforcement learning objective to answer Boolean queries. Trained only on simple, small instances, AnyCQ generalizes to large queries of arbitrary structure, reliably classifying and retrieving answers to queries that existing approaches fail to handle. This is empirically validated through our newly proposed, challenging benchmarks. Finally, we empirically show that AnyCQ can effectively transfer to completely novel knowledge graphs when equipped with an appropriate link prediction model, highlighting its potential for querying incomplete data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Target Zone Blood Glucose Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03875v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Managing physiological variables within clinically safe target zones is a central challenge in healthcare, particularly for chronic conditions such as Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Reinforcement learning (RL) offers promise for personalising treatment, but struggles with the delayed and heterogeneous effects of interventions. We propose a novel RL framework to study and support decision-making in T1DM technologies, such as automated insulin delivery. Our approach captures the complex temporal dynamics of treatment by unifying two control modalities: \textit{impulse control} for discrete, fast-acting interventions (e.g., insulin boluses), and \textit{switching control} for longer-acting treatments and regime shifts. The core of our method is a constrained Markov decision process augmented with physiological state features, enabling safe policy learning under clinical and resource constraints. The framework incorporates biologically realistic factors, including insulin decay, leading to policies that better reflect real-world therapeutic behaviour. While not intended for clinical deployment, this work establishes a foundation for future safe and temporally-aware RL in healthcare. We provide theoretical guarantees of convergence and demonstrate empirical improvements in a stylised T1DM control task, reducing blood glucose level violations from 22.4\% (state-of-the-art) to as low as 10.8\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evo-MARL: Co-Evolutionary Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Internalized Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03864v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on multimodal large language models exhibit strong collaboration and performance. However, their growing openness and interaction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial attacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as dedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this paradigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection, and (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised, system-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents further raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Evo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than relying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to simultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats, ensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure. Furthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing reinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial training paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS performance under co-evolving threats. Experiments show that Evo-MARL reduces attack success rates by up to 22% while boosting accuracy by up to 5% on reasoning tasks-demonstrating that safety and utility can be jointly improved.</p></details> |  |

Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities to use search engines during inference is often suboptimal, as the LLM might not fully possess the capability on how to interact optimally with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning frameworks where the LLM learns to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 41% (Qwen2.5-7B) and 20% (Qwen2.5-3B) over various RAG baselines under the same setting. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from demonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice policy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like autonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we need not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal guarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability guarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy -- providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further demonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the reward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces, we prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic methods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at RLC 2025</p></details> |
| **[CompassVerifier: A Unified and Robust Verifier for LLMs Evaluation and Outcome Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03686v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models (LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but also serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation frameworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer verification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules or evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current methodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically evaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent stage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the robustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across different domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and robust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It demonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse reasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including multi-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively identifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark comprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented through manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We anticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer verification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research.

Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent training and deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Q-Learning for Real-World Control: A Case Study in Series Hybrid Agricultural Tractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03647v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The variable and unpredictable load demands in hybrid agricultural tractors make it difficult to design optimal rule-based energy management strategies, motivating the use of adaptive, learning-based control. However, existing approaches often rely on basic fuel-based rewards and do not leverage expert demonstrations to accelerate training. In this paper, first, the performance of Q-value-based reinforcement learning algorithms is evaluated for powertrain control in a hybrid agricultural tractor. Three algorithms, Double Q-Learning (DQL), Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and Double DQN (DDQN), are compared in terms of convergence speed and policy optimality. Second, a piecewise domain-specific reward-shaping strategy is introduced to improve learning efficiency and steer agent behavior toward engine fuel-efficient operating regions. Third, the design of the experience replay buffer is examined, with a focus on the effects of seeding the buffer with expert demonstrations and analyzing how different types of expert policies influence convergence dynamics and final performance. Experimental results demonstrate that (1) DDQN achieves 70\% faster convergence than DQN in this application domain, (2) the proposed reward shaping method effectively biases the learned policy toward fuel-efficient outcomes, and (3) initializing the replay buffer with structured expert data leads to a 33\% improvement in convergence speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiWA: Diffusion Policy Adaptation with World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03645v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents significant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction impedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require millions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical fine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion policies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong dependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement learning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment interactions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective adaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline play interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency, making the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot learning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across eight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude fewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world robotic skills using an offline world model. We make the code publicly available at https://diwa.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL)</p></details> |

| **[Probing and Enhancing the Robustness of GNN-based QEC Decoders with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03783v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful, data-driven approach for Quantum Error Correction (QEC) decoding, capable of learning complex noise characteristics directly from syndrome data. However, the robustness of these decoders against subtle, adversarial perturbations remains a critical open question. This work introduces a novel framework to systematically probe the vulnerabilities of a GNN decoder using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The RL agent is trained as an adversary with the goal of finding minimal syndrome modifications that cause the decoder to misclassify. We apply this framework to a Graph Attention Network (GAT) decoder trained on experimental surface code data from Google Quantum AI. Our results show that the RL agent can successfully identify specific, critical vulnerabilities, achieving a high attack success rate with a minimal number of bit flips. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the decoder's robustness can be significantly enhanced through adversarial training, where the model is retrained on the adversarial examples generated by the RL agent. This iterative process of automated vulnerability discovery and targeted retraining presents a promising methodology for developing more reliable and robust neural network decoders for fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures, Affiliation updated to match user registration</p></details> |

Unreliable Results of Reinforcement Learning Due to Data Contamination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10532v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning in large language models has long been a central research focus, and recent studies employing reinforcement learning (RL) have introduced diverse methods that yield substantial performance gains with minimal or even no external supervision. Surprisingly, some studies even suggest that random or incorrect reward signals can enhance performance. However, these breakthroughs are predominantly observed for the mathematically strong Qwen2.5 series on benchmarks such as MATH-500, AMC, and AIME, and seldom transfer to models like Llama, which warrants a more in-depth investigation. In this work, our empirical analysis reveals that pre-training on massive web-scale corpora leaves Qwen2.5 susceptible to data contamination in widely used benchmarks. Consequently, conclusions derived from contaminated benchmarks on Qwen2.5 series may be unreliable. To obtain trustworthy evaluation results, we introduce a generator that creates fully clean arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, dubbed RandomCalculation. Using this leakage-free dataset, we show that only accurate reward signals yield steady improvements that surpass the base model's performance boundary in mathematical reasoning, whereas random or incorrect rewards do not. Moreover, we conduct more fine-grained analyses to elucidate the factors underlying the different performance observed on the MATH-500 and RandomCalculation benchmarks. Consequently, we recommend that future studies evaluate models on uncontaminated benchmarks and, when feasible, test various model series to ensure trustworthy conclusions about RL and related methods.</p></details> | 33 pages |
| **[SLA-MORL: SLA-Aware Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for HPC Resource Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03509v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic resource allocation for machine learning workloads in cloud environments remains challenging due to competing objectives of minimizing training time and operational costs while meeting Service Level Agreement (SLA) constraints. Traditional approaches employ static resource allocation or single-objective optimization, leading to either SLA violations or resource waste. We present SLA-MORL, an adaptive multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that intelligently allocates GPU and CPU resources based on user-defined preferences (time, cost, or balanced) while ensuring SLA compliance. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) intelligent initialization through historical learning or efficient baseline runs that eliminates cold-start problems, reducing initial exploration overhead by 60%, and (2) dynamic weight adaptation that automatically adjusts optimization priorities based on real-time SLA violation severity, creating a self-correcting system. SLA-MORL constructs a 21-dimensional state representation capturing resource utilization, training progress, and SLA compliance, enabling an actor-critic network to make informed allocation decisions across 9 possible actions. Extensive evaluation on 13 diverse ML workloads using production HPC infrastructure demonstrates that SLA-MORL achieves 67.2% reduction in training time for deadline-critical jobs, 68.8% reduction in costs for budget-constrained workloads, and 73.4% improvement in overall SLA compliance compared to static baselines. By addressing both cold-start inefficiency and dynamic adaptation challenges, SLA-MORL provides a practical solution for cloud resource management that balances performance, cost, and reliability in modern ML training environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Average-Reward Soft Actor-Critic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09080v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The average-reward formulation of reinforcement learning (RL) has drawn increased interest in recent years for its ability to solve temporally-extended problems without relying on discounting. Meanwhile, in the discounted setting, algorithms with entropy regularization have been developed, leading to improvements over deterministic methods. Despite the distinct benefits of these approaches, deep RL algorithms for the entropy-regularized average-reward objective have not been developed. While policy-gradient based approaches have recently been presented for the average-reward literature, the corresponding actor-critic framework remains less explored. In this paper, we introduce an average-reward soft actor-critic algorithm to address these gaps in the field. We validate our method by comparing with existing average-reward algorithms on standard RL benchmarks, achieving superior performance for the average-reward criterion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2nd Reinforcement Learning Conference (Journal Track)</p></details> |
| **[Training Long-Context, Multi-Turn Software Engineering Agents with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03501v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language Models (LLMs) has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as mathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can be viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE), which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that responds to each action with a non-trivial observation. To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this general regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world software engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to 39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches or outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward building more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based on open models.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents BitsAI-Fix, an automated lint error remediation workflow based on Large Language Models (LLMs), designed to address this critical challenge in industrial-scale environments. BitsAI-Fix employs tree-sitter for context expansion and generates search-and-replace format patches through specially trained LLMs, followed by lint scan re-verification to output final remediation results. Additionally, our approach introduces an innovative progressive reinforcement learning (RL) training strategy that can automatically acquire verifiable training data during the project cold-start phase and continuously iterate the model by collecting online samples through feedback after system deployment. Furthermore, we designed a targeted rule-based reward mechanism that combines format rewards and correctness rewards while penalizing redundant modifications. We also propose a "code diff matching" methodology to continuously track online effectiveness. In production deployment at ByteDance, our solution has supported over 5,000 engineers, resolved more than 12,000 static analysis issues, achieved approximately 85% remediation accuracy, with around 1,000 weekly active adopters. This work demonstrates the practical feasibility of LLM-based code remediation solutions in enterprise environments and serves as a reference for automated code fix in large-scale industrial scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The framework enables systematic comparisons between LLM based agents and other agents (random, human, reinforcement learning agents, etc.) in various game scenarios by wrapping multiple board and matrix games and supporting different agent types. It integrates API access to models via LiteLLM, local model deployment via vLLM, and offers distributed execution through Ray. Additionally it provides extensive analysis tools for the LLM reasoning traces.

| **[When Good Sounds Go Adversarial: Jailbreaking Audio-Language Models with Benign Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03365v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models become increasingly integrated into daily life, audio has emerged as a key interface for human-AI interaction. However, this convenience also introduces new vulnerabilities, making audio a potential attack surface for adversaries. Our research introduces WhisperInject, a two-stage adversarial audio attack framework that can manipulate state-of-the-art audio language models to generate harmful content. Our method uses imperceptible perturbations in audio inputs that remain benign to human listeners. The first stage uses a novel reward-based optimization method, Reinforcement Learning with Projected Gradient Descent (RL-PGD), to guide the target model to circumvent its own safety protocols and generate harmful native responses. This native harmful response then serves as the target for Stage 2, Payload Injection, where we use Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to optimize subtle perturbations that are embedded into benign audio carriers, such as weather queries or greeting messages. Validated under the rigorous StrongREJECT, LlamaGuard, as well as Human Evaluation safety evaluation framework, our experiments demonstrate a success rate exceeding 86% across Qwen2.5-Omni-3B, Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, and Phi-4-Multimodal. Our work demonstrates a new class of practical, audio-native threats, moving beyond theoretical exploits to reveal a feasible and covert method for manipulating AI behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compressing Chain-of-Thought in LLMs via Step Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03346v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric that quantifies the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps to identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning, which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly enhances LLM inference efficiency while rigorously preserving accuracy, offering profound implications for practical LLM deployment and a deeper understanding of reasoning structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Revealing the Effectiveness of Small-Scale Fine-tuning in R1-style Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17988v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>R1-style Reinforcement Learning (RL) significantly enhances Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet the mechanism behind rule-based RL remains unclear. We found that small-scale SFT has substantial influence on RL but shows poor efficiency. To explain our observations, we propose an analytical framework and compare the efficiency of SFT and RL by measuring \textbf{sample effect}. Our hypothetical analysis shows the potential to improve SFT efficiency. Guided by our analysis, we propose \textbf{Re-distillation}, a technique that aims to boost the effectiveness of small-scale distillation by sampling from the RL-trained policy. Re-distillation shows consistent surprising efficiency on three datasets and both Qwen\&Llama models: Re-distilled models matched RL performance with far fewer samples and less computation. As a result, on K\&K dataset, our re-distilled Qwen-2.5-1.5B model surpasses DeepSeek-V3-0324 with only 1K SFT samples. We demonstrate that re-distillation can be used to efficiently balance multiple goals in RL. Our work explains several interesting phenomena in R1-style RL, shedding light on the mechanisms behind its empirical success.

| **[KCR: Resolving Long-Context Knowledge Conflicts via Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01273v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge conflicts commonly arise across diverse sources, and their prevalence has increased with the advent of LLMs. When dealing with conflicts between multiple contexts, also known as \emph{inter-context knowledge conflicts}, LLMs are often confused by lengthy and conflicting contexts. To address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR) framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge. The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning process by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with stronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts. Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or local knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we employ Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of reasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the incorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire the capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts in long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shaping Sparse Rewards in Reinforcement Learning: A Semi-supervised Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19128v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world scenarios, reward signal for agents are exceedingly sparse, making it challenging to learn an effective reward function for reward shaping. To address this issue, the proposed approach in this paper performs reward shaping not only by utilizing non-zero-reward transitions but also by employing the \emph{Semi-Supervised Learning} (SSL) technique combined with a novel data augmentation to learn trajectory space representations from the majority of transitions, {i.e}., zero-reward transitions, thereby improving the efficacy of reward shaping. Experimental results in Atari and robotic manipulation demonstrate that our method outperforms supervised-based approaches in reward inference, leading to higher agent scores. Notably, in more sparse-reward environments, our method achieves up to twice the peak scores compared to supervised baselines. The proposed double entropy data augmentation enhances performance, showcasing a 15.8\% increase in best score over other augmentation methods</p></details> |  |

Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel Business-Centric Network (BCN) aimed at enabling scalable QoS provisioning, based on a cross-layer framework that captures the relationship between application, transport parameters, and channels. We investigate both continuous flow and event-driven flow models, presenting key QoS metrics such as throughput, delay, and reliability. By jointly considering power and bandwidth allocation, transmission parameters, and AP network topology across layers, we optimize weighted resource efficiency with statistical QoS provisioning. To address the coupling among parameters, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, which is Collaborative Optimization among Heterogeneous Actors with Experience Sharing (COHA-ES). Power and sub-channel (SC) Actors representing multiple APs are jointly optimized under the unified guidance of a common critic. Additionally, we introduce a novel multithreaded experience-sharing mechanism to accelerate training and enhance rewards. Extensive comparative experiments validate the effectiveness of our DRL framework in terms of convergence and efficiency. Moreover, comparative analyses demonstrate the comprehensive advantages of the BCN structure in enhancing both spectral and energy efficiency.</p></details> | 19 figures |

These limitations arise from the absence of theory-aligned supervision and the difficulty of capturing nuanced mental processes in real-world narratives. To address this gap, we leverage expert-labeled, psychologically rich scenarios and propose a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework that explicitly imitates expert psychological thought patterns. By integrating real-world stimuli with structured reasoning guidance, our approach enables compact models to internalize social-cognitive principles, perform nuanced psychological inference, and support continual self-improvement. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks further demonstrate that our models achieve expert-level interpretive capabilities, exhibiting strong out-of-distribution generalization and robust continual learning across diverse, challenging, and psychologically grounded tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling DRL for Decision Making: A Survey on Data, Network, and Training Budget Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03194v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the expansion of neural network models and training data has driven remarkable progress in deep learning, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing. This advancement is underpinned by the concept of Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training data enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed breakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and advanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its potential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for decision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by systematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network, and training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data efficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the relationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we investigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions, ensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which collectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational challenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of distributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary training on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these strategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in advancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future research. We emphasize the importance of balancing scalability with computational efficiency and outline promising directions for leveraging scaling to unlock the full potential of DRL in various tasks such as robot control, autonomous driving and LLM training.</p></details> |  |

Our investigation identifies lazy reasoning during the thinking stage as the primary factor contributing to poor instruction adherence. To mitigate this issue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous reasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for satisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate instructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain valid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard, easy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to curate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization of the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns. Subsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning (Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL) reinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach encourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering generalizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking. Extensive experiments conducted on instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate remarkable performance improvements across various model scales. Notably, our Light-IF-32B model surpasses both larger open-source models such as DeepSeek-R1 and closed-source models like Doubao-1.6.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Subsequent investigations into enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework, ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), that enables MLLMs to learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle, i.e., verifying the rendered output against the source image is substantially easier than performing deep visual reasoning to generate a faithful, structured representation such as code. We demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL), thereby reducing reliance on image-text supervision. RRVF implements a closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual feedback components, enabling the model to perform complex reasoning, including self-correction through multi-turn interactions. This process is optimized end-to-end using the GRPO algorithm. Extensive evaluations are conducted on image-to-code generation across two diverse domains: data charts and web interfaces. The RRVF-trained model not only outperforms existing similarly sized open-source MLLMs and supervised fine-tuning baselines but also exhibits superior generalization. Notably, the model outperforms the more advanced MLLM used to generate visual feedback during training. %only in arxiv Code is available at https://github.com/L-O-I/RRVF.</p></details> |  |

To improve this, we propose Diffusion Loss-Guided Policy Optimization (DLPO), an RLHF framework for TTS diffusion models. DLPO integrates the original training loss into the reward function, preserving generative capabilities while reducing inefficiencies. Using naturalness scores as feedback, DLPO aligns reward optimization with the diffusion model's structure, improving speech quality. We evaluate DLPO on WaveGrad 2, a non-autoregressive diffusion-based TTS model. Results show significant improvements in objective metrics (UTMOS 3.65, NISQA 4.02) and subjective evaluations, with DLPO audio preferred 67\% of the time. These findings demonstrate DLPO's potential for efficient, high-quality diffusion TTS in real-time, resource-limited settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 figure, INTERSPEECH 2025. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.14632</p></details> |

While recent methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce AVATAR (Audio-Video Agent for Alignment and Reasoning), a framework that addresses these limitations through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping (TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases during learning. AVATAR achieves strong performance across various benchmarks, outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by +5.4on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and +4.5 on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating over 35% higher sample efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, we observe that this paradigm performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift, ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations (qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM, enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second, reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in imitation learning.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

This paper introduces an innovative approach that combines Genetic Programming (GP) with a Transformer trained through Reinforcement Learning (GPRT), specifically designed to tackle the complexities of dynamic scheduling scenarios. GPRT leverages the Transformer to refine heuristics generated by GP while also seeding and guiding the evolution of GP. This dual functionality enhances the adaptability and effectiveness of the scheduling heuristics, enabling them to better respond to the dynamic nature of real-world tasks. The efficacy of this integrated approach is demonstrated through a practical application in container terminal truck scheduling, where the GPRT method outperforms traditional GP, standalone Transformer methods, and other state-of-the-art competitors. The key contribution of this research is the development of the GPRT method, which showcases a novel combination of GP and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to produce robust and efficient scheduling solutions. Importantly, GPRT is not limited to container port truck scheduling; it offers a versatile framework applicable to various dynamic scheduling challenges. Its practicality, coupled with its interpretability and ease of modification, makes it a valuable tool for diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Such noise may cause models to lose attention on key words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward denoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the value model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a passive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and model-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO baselines. Our findings underscore the often-overlooked importance of the value model in RLHF and offer a principled and practical approach to robust policy optimization in noisy real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Promise of RL for Autoregressive Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01119v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at https://github.com/mair-lab/EARL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Surface-Level Detection: Towards Cognitive-Driven Defense Against Jailbreak Attacks via Meta-Operations Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03054v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is essential for their safe and reliable deployment. Existing defenses often rely on shallow pattern matching, which struggles to generalize to novel and unseen attack strategies. To address this challenge, we propose the Cognitive-Driven Defense (CDD) framework, which targets the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by applying meta-operations, defined as basic manipulations that conceal harmful intent.CDD emulates human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning chain. It begins with a global perception of the prompt and follows with a localized analysis to uncover hidden manipulations. By applying supervised fine-tuning on this structured chain, the model learns to identify and reason about known manipulation patterns. To enhance generalization to unseen threats, an entropy-guided reinforcement learning algorithm (EG-GRPO) is introduced to encourage exploration of new types and variants of meta-operations. Experiments demonstrate that CDD can achieve state-of-the-art defense performance and exhibit strong generalization to unseen jailbreak attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[TVDO: Tchebycheff Value-Decomposition Optimization for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13979v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cooperative multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL), centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) has recently attracted more attention due to the physical demand. However, the most dilemma therein is the inconsistency between jointly-trained policies and individually-executed actions. In this article, we propose a factorized Tchebycheff value-decomposition optimization (TVDO) method to overcome the trouble of inconsistency. In particular, a nonlinear Tchebycheff aggregation function is formulated to realize the global optimum by tightly constraining the upper bound of individual action-value bias, which is inspired by the Tchebycheff method of multi-objective optimization. We theoretically prove that, under no extra limitations, the factorized value decomposition with Tchebycheff aggregation satisfies the sufficiency and necessity of Individual-Global-Max (IGM), which guarantees the consistency between the global and individual optimal action-value function. Empirically, in the climb and penalty game, we verify that TVDO precisely expresses the global-to-individual value decomposition with a guarantee of policy consistency. Meanwhile, we evaluate TVDO in the SMAC benchmark, and extensive experiments demonstrate that TVDO achieves a significant performance superiority over some SOTA MARL baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Near-Optimal Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning in Online Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03768v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) faces significant challenges in real-world deployments due to the sim-to-real gap, where policies trained in simulators often underperform in practice due to mismatches between training and deployment conditions. Distributionally robust RL addresses this issue by optimizing worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of environments and providing an optimized lower bound on deployment performance. However, existing studies typically assume access to either a generative model or offline datasets with broad coverage of the deployment environment -- assumptions that limit their practicality in unknown environments without prior knowledge. In this work, we study the more realistic and challenging setting of online distributionally robust RL, where the agent interacts only with a single unknown training environment while aiming to optimize its worst-case performance. We focus on general $f$-divergence-based uncertainty sets, including Chi-Square and KL divergence balls, and propose a computationally efficient algorithm with sublinear regret guarantees under minimal assumptions. Furthermore, we establish a minimax lower bound on regret of online learning, demonstrating the near-optimality of our approach. Extensive experiments across diverse environments further confirm the robustness and efficiency of our algorithm, validating our theoretical findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2404.03578 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Post-Completion Learning for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20252v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current language model training paradigms typically terminate learning upon reaching the end-of-sequence (<eos>) token, overlooking the potential learning opportunities in the post-completion space. We propose Post-Completion Learning (PCL), a novel training framework that systematically utilizes the sequence space after model output completion, to enhance both the reasoning and self-evaluation abilities. PCL enables models to continue generating self-assessments and reward predictions during training, while maintaining efficient inference by stopping at the completion point. To fully utilize this post-completion space, we design a white-box reinforcement learning method: let the model evaluate the output content according to the reward rules, then calculate and align the score with the reward functions for supervision. We implement dual-track SFT to optimize both reasoning and evaluation capabilities, and mixed it with RL training to achieve multi-objective hybrid optimization. Experimental results on different datasets and models demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional SFT and RL methods. Our method provides a new technical path for language model training that enhances output quality while preserving deployment efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Policy Optimization: A Data Curation Flywheel for Sparse-Reward Long-Horizon Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03018v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Reasoning Models have demonstrated remarkable success on static tasks, yet their application to multi-round agentic planning in interactive environments faces two fundamental challenges. First, the intractable credit assignment problem renders conventional reinforcement learning ineffective in sparse-reward settings. Second, the computational overhead of verbose, step-by-step reasoning histories is prohibitive. To address these challenges, we propose BPO, a three-stage framework (bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement) that establishes a self-improving data flywheel to develop robust reasoning models for long-horizon, sparse-reward environments. Our framework first bootstraps efficient reasoning using the proposed planning quaternions with long-short chain-of-thought fusion. It then extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks through complexity-stratified curriculum learning. Finally, the model iteratively refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via reward-gated rejection sampling. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and WebShop demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art with significant token efficiency, providing a new recipe for reasoning models in agentic planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy-Based Reward Models for Robust Language Model Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13134v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models (RMs) are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, they often struggle with capturing complex human preferences and generalizing to unseen data. To address these challenges, we introduce Energy-Based Reward Model (EBRM), a lightweight post-hoc refinement framework that enhances RM robustness and generalization. EBRM models the reward distribution explicitly, capturing uncertainty in human preferences and mitigating the impact of noisy or misaligned annotations. It achieves this through conflict-aware data filtering, label-noise-aware contrastive training, and hybrid initialization. Notably, EBRM enhances RMs without retraining, making it computationally efficient and adaptable across different models and tasks. Empirical evaluations on RM benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in both robustness and generalization, achieving up to a 5.97% improvement in safety-critical alignment tasks compared to standard RMs. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments confirm that our refined rewards enhance alignment quality, effectively delaying reward hacking. These results demonstrate our approach as a scalable and effective enhancement for existing RMs and alignment pipelines. The code is available at EBRM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by COLM 2025</p></details> |

With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reasoning has emerged as a key capability that distinguishes advanced AI systems from conventional models that empower chatbots. In this survey, we categorize existing methods along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) Regimes, which define the stage at which reasoning is achieved (either at inference time or through dedicated training); and (2) Architectures, which determine the components involved in the reasoning process, distinguishing between standalone LLMs and agentic compound systems that incorporate external tools, and multi-agent collaborations. Within each dimension, we analyze two key perspectives: (1) Input level, which focuses on techniques that construct high-quality prompts that the LLM condition on; and (2) Output level, which methods that refine multiple sampled candidates to enhance reasoning quality. This categorization provides a systematic understanding of the evolving landscape of LLM reasoning, highlighting emerging trends such as the shift from inference-scaling to learning-to-reason (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), and the transition to agentic workflows (e.g., OpenAI Deep Research, Manus Agent). Additionally, we cover a broad spectrum of learning algorithms, from supervised fine-tuning to reinforcement learning such as PPO and GRPO, and the training of reasoners and verifiers. We also examine key designs of agentic workflows, from established patterns like generator-evaluator and LLM debate to recent innovations. ...</p></details> | <details><summary>72 pa...</summary><p>72 pages, 6 figures.

| **[HypRL: Reinforcement Learning of Control Policies for Hyperproperties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04675v4)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward shaping in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for complex tasks remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often fail to find optimal solutions or cannot efficiently handle such tasks. We propose HYPRL, a specification-guided reinforcement learning framework that learns control policies w.r.t. hyperproperties expressed in HyperLTL. Hyperproperties constitute a powerful formalism for specifying objectives and constraints over sets of execution traces across agents. To learn policies that maximize the satisfaction of a HyperLTL formula $\phi$, we apply Skolemization to manage quantifier alternations and define quantitative robustness functions to shape rewards over execution traces of a Markov decision process with unknown transitions. A suitable RL algorithm is then used to learn policies that collectively maximize the expected reward and, consequently, increase the probability of satisfying $\phi$. We evaluate HYPRL on a diverse set of benchmarks, including safety-aware planning, Deep Sea Treasure, and the Post Correspondence Problem. We also compare with specification-driven baselines to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of HYPRL.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Mobility Control of gNBs in Dynamic Radio Access Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02960v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing complexity of wireless environments, characterized by user mobility and dynamic obstructions, poses challenges for the maintenance of Line-of-Sight (LoS) connectivity. Mobile base stations (gNBs) stand as a promising solution by physically relocating to restore or sustain LoS, thereby necessitating the development of intelligent algorithms for autonomous movement control. As part of the CONVERGE research project, which is developing an experimental chamber to integrate computer vision (CV) into mobile networks and enhance Quality of Service (QoS) in dynamic wireless environments, this paper presents two key contributions. First, we introduce the CONVERGE Chamber Simulator (CC-SIM), a 3D simulation environment for developing, training, and validating mobility control algorithms for mobile gNBs. CC-SIM models user and obstacle mobility, visual occlusion, and Radio Frequency (RF) propagation behavior. It supports both offline reinforcement learning and real-time testing through tight integration with a standalone 5G system via the OpenAirInterface (OAI) RF simulator, enabling validation under realistic network conditions. Second, leveraging CC-SIM, we develop a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent that learns to reposition the gNB proactively in response to dynamic environmental changes. Experiments across three representative use cases show that the trained agent significantly reduces LoS blockage time - by up to 42% - when compared to static deployments. These results highlight the effectiveness of learning-based mobility control in adaptive next-generation wireless networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning under Model Uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02948v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Well-trained multi-agent systems can fail when deployed in real-world environments due to model mismatches between the training and deployment environments, caused by environment uncertainties including noise or adversarial attacks. Distributionally Robust Markov Games (DRMGs) enhance system resilience by optimizing for worst-case performance over a defined set of environmental uncertainties. However, current methods are limited by their dependence on simulators or large offline datasets, which are often unavailable. This paper pioneers the study of online learning in DRMGs, where agents learn directly from environmental interactions without prior data. We introduce the {\it Robust Optimistic Nash Value Iteration (RONAVI)} algorithm and provide the first provable guarantees for this setting. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves low regret and efficiently finds the optimal robust policy for uncertainty sets measured by Total Variation divergence and Kullback-Leibler divergence. These results establish a new, practical path toward developing truly robust multi-agent systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Based Soft Maximization of Suitable Metrics of Long-Term Human Power](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00159v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Power is a key concept in AI safety: power-seeking as an instrumental goal, sudden or gradual disempowerment of humans, power balance in human-AI interaction and international AI governance. At the same time, power as the ability to pursue diverse goals is essential for wellbeing. This paper explores the idea of promoting both safety and wellbeing by forcing AI agents explicitly to empower humans and to manage the power balance between humans and AI agents in a desirable way. Using a principled, partially axiomatic approach, we design a parametrizable and decomposable objective function that represents an inequality- and risk-averse long-term aggregate of human power. It takes into account humans' bounded rationality and social norms, and, crucially, considers a wide variety of possible human goals. We derive algorithms for computing that metric by backward induction or approximating it via a form of multi-agent reinforcement learning from a given world model. We exemplify the consequences of (softly) maximizing this metric in a variety of paradigmatic situations and describe what instrumental sub-goals it will likely imply. Our cautious assessment is that softly maximizing suitable aggregate metrics of human power might constitute a beneficial objective for agentic AI systems that is safer than direct utility-based objectives.</p></details> |  |

For the learned approach, we introduce Learned Direct Communication (LDC), where agents generate messages and actions concurrently via a neural network. Our engineered approach, Intention Communication, employs an Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM) and a Message Generation Network (MGN) to formulate messages based on predicted future states. Both strategies are evaluated on their success rates in cooperative tasks under fully and partially observable conditions. Our findings indicate that while emergent communication is viable, the engineered approach demonstrates superior performance and scalability, particularly as environmental complexity increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning telic-controllable state representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14476v3)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational models of purposeful behavior comprise both descriptive and prescriptive aspects, used respectively to ascertain and evaluate situations in the world. In reinforcement learning, prescriptive reward functions are assumed to depend on predefined and fixed descriptive state representations. Alternatively, these two aspects may emerge interdependently: goals can shape the acquired state representations and vice versa. Here, we present a computational framework for state representation learning in bounded agents, where descriptive and prescriptive aspects are coupled through the notion of goal-directed, or telic, states. We introduce the concept of telic-controllability to characterize the tradeoff between the granularity of a telic state representation and the policy complexity required to reach all telic states. We propose an algorithm for learning telic-controllable state representations, illustrating it using a simulated navigation task. Our framework highlights the role of deliberate ignorance -- knowing what to ignore -- for learning state representations that balance goal flexibility and cognitive complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the 47th Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society</p></details> |

This paper introduces a novel framework employing an advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent for proactive and adaptive defense against these sophisticated attacks. A key innovation is leveraging Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) capabilities for active, intelligent threat assessment. The DRL agent, built on a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, dynamically controls ISAC probing actions to investigate suspicious activities. We introduce an intensive curriculum learning strategy that guarantees the agent experiences successful detection during training to overcome the complex exploration challenges inherent to such a security-critical task. Consequently, the agent learns a robust and adaptive policy that intelligently balances security and communication performance. Numerical results demonstrate that our framework achieves a mean attacker detection rate of 92.8% while maintaining an average user SINR of over 13 dB.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Theory and Practice of GRPO: A Trajectory-Corrected Approach with Fast Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02833v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), recently proposed by DeepSeek, is a critic-free reinforcement learning algorithm for fine tuning large language models. It replaces the value function in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with group normalized rewards, while retaining PPO style token level importance sampling based on an old policy. We show that GRPO update rule in fact estimates the policy gradient at the old policy rather than the current one. However, since the old policy is refreshed every few steps, the discrepancy between the two remains small limiting the impact of this bias in practice. We validate this through an ablation study in which importance sampling is entirely removed, and updates are instead performed using the gradient estimated at a fixed old policy across multiple optimization steps. Remarkably, this simplification results in performance comparable to standard GRPO. Motivated by these findings, we propose a new algorithm: Trajectory level Importance Corrected GRPO (TIC GRPO). TIC GRPO replaces token level importance ratios with a single trajectory level probability ratio, yielding an unbiased estimate of the current policy gradient while preserving the critic free structure. Furthermore, we present the first theoretical convergence analysis for GRPO style methods, covering both the original GRPO and our proposed variant.</p></details> | 12 pages |

However, despite the availability of advanced multi-agent frameworks, their real-world deployment on robots remains limited, hindering the advancement of MARS research in practice. To bridge this gap, we conducted two studies to investigate performance trade-offs of hierarchical multi-agent frameworks in a simulated real-world multi-robot healthcare scenario. In Study 1, using CrewAI, we iteratively refine the system's knowledge base, to systematically identify and categorize coordination failures (e.g., tool access violations, lack of timely handling of failure reports) not resolvable by providing contextual knowledge alone. In Study 2, using AutoGen, we evaluate a redesigned bidirectional communication structure and further measure the trade-offs between reasoning and non-reasoning models operating within the same robotic team setting. Drawing from our empirical findings, we emphasize the tension between autonomy and stability and the importance of edge-case testing to improve system reliability and safety for future real-world deployment. Supplementary materials, including codes, task agent setup, trace outputs, and annotated examples of coordination failures and reasoning behaviors, are available at: https://byc-sophie.github.io/mas-to-mars/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compact LED-Based Displacement Sensing for Robot Fingers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03481v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a sensor designed for integration in robot fingers, where it can provide information on the displacements induced by external contact. Our sensor uses LEDs to sense the displacement between two plates connected by a transparent elastomer; when a force is applied to the finger, the elastomer displaces and the LED signals change. We show that using LEDs as both light emitters an receivers in this context provides high sensitivity, allowing such an emitter and receiver pairs to detect very small displacements. We characterize the standalone performance of the sensor by testing the ability of a supervised learning model to predict complete force and torque data from its raw signals, and obtain a mean error between 0.05 and 0.07 N across the three directions of force applied to the finger. Our method allows for finger-size packaging with no amplification electronics, low cost manufacturing, easy integration into a complete hand, and high overload shear forces and bending torques, suggesting future applicability to complete manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Behaviorally Adaptive Multi-Robot Hazard Localization in Failure-Prone, Communication-Denied Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04537v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of multi-robot autonomous hazard mapping in high-risk, failure-prone, communication-denied environments such as post-disaster zones, underground mines, caves, and planetary surfaces. In these missions, robots must explore and map hazards while minimizing the risk of failure due to environmental threats or hardware limitations. We introduce a behavior-adaptive, information-theoretic planning framework for multi-robot teams grounded in the concept of Behavioral Entropy (BE), that generalizes Shannon entropy (SE) to capture diverse human-like uncertainty evaluations. Building on this formulation, we propose the Behavior-Adaptive Path Planning (BAPP) framework, which modulates information gathering strategies via a tunable risk-sensitivity parameter, and present two planning algorithms: BAPP-TID for intelligent triggering of high-fidelity robots, and BAPP-SIG for safe deployment under high risk. We provide theoretical insights on the informativeness of the proposed BAPP framework and validate its effectiveness through both single-robot and multi-robot simulations. Our results show that the BAPP stack consistently outperforms Shannon-based and random strategies: BAPP-TID accelerates entropy reduction, while BAPP-SIG improves robot survivability with minimal loss in information gain. In multi-agent deployments, BAPP scales effectively through spatial partitioning, mobile base relocation, and role-aware heterogeneity. These findings underscore the value of behavior-adaptive planning for robust, risk-sensitive exploration in complex, failure-prone environments.</p></details> |  |

However, when deployed on a physical robot, these models are subject to errors due to real-world physics and uncertainty in how the lower-level controller follows the planned trajectory. In this work, we address this problem by presenting three methods of incorporating stochastic controller behavior into the recombinant search space of the Kinodynamic Efficiently Adaptive State Lattice (KEASL) planner. To demonstrate this work, we analyze the results of experiments performed on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) in an off-road, unstructured environment using two different perception algorithms, and performed an ablation study using a full spectrum of simulated environment map complexities. Analysis of the data found that incorporating stochastic controller sampling into KEASL leads to more conservative trajectories that decrease predicted collision likelihood when compared to KEASL without sampling. When compared to baseline planning with expanded obstacle footprints, the predicted likelihood of collisions becomes more comparable, but reduces the planning success rate for baseline search.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the International Symposium on Experimental Robotics (ISER) 2025</p></details> |

This paper proposes a binaural sound event localization and detection (BiSELD) neural network to address these challenges. BiSELDnet learns time-frequency patterns and head-related transfer function (HRTF) localization cues from binaural input features. A novel eight-channel binaural time-frequency feature (BTFF) is introduced, comprising left/right mel-spectrograms, V-maps, an interaural time difference (ITD) map (below 1.5 kHz), an interaural level difference (ILD) map (above 5 kHz with front-back asymmetry), and spectral cue (SC) maps (above 5 kHz for elevation). The effectiveness of BTFF was confirmed across omnidirectional, horizontal, and median planes. BiSELDnets, particularly one based on the efficient Trinity module, were implemented to output time series of direction vectors for each sound event class, enabling simultaneous detection and localization. Vector activation map (VAM) visualization was proposed to analyze network learning, confirming BiSELDnet's focus on the N1 notch frequency for elevation estimation. Comparative evaluations under urban background noise conditions demonstrated that the proposed BiSELD model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SELD models with binaural input.</p></details> | 200 pages |

The objective of the SMC is to achieve precise and consistent tracking of the trajectory of the robot manipulator under uncertain and disturbed conditions. However, the system effectiveness and robustness depend on the choice of the SMC parameters, which is a difficult and crucial task. To solve this problem, a genetic algorithm is used to locate the optimal values of these parameters that gratify the capability criteria. The proposed method is efficient compared with the conventional SMC and Fuzzy-SMC. The simulation results show that the genetic algorithm with SMC can achieve better tracking capability and reduce the chattering effect.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferring Expert Cognitive Models to Social Robots via Agentic Concept Bottleneck Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03998v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Successful group meetings, such as those implemented in group behavioral-change programs, work meetings, and other social contexts, must promote individual goal setting and execution while strengthening the social relationships within the group. Consequently, an ideal facilitator must be sensitive to the subtle dynamics of disengagement, difficulties with individual goal setting and execution, and interpersonal difficulties that signal a need for intervention. The challenges and cognitive load experienced by facilitators create a critical gap for an embodied technology that can interpret social exchanges while remaining aware of the needs of the individuals in the group and providing transparent recommendations that go beyond powerful but "black box" foundation models (FMs) that identify social cues. We address this important demand with a social robot co-facilitator that analyzes multimodal meeting data and provides discreet cues to the facilitator. The robot's reasoning is powered by an agentic concept bottleneck model (CBM), which makes decisions based on human-interpretable concepts like participant engagement and sentiments, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. Our core contribution is a transfer learning framework that distills the broad social understanding of an FM into our specialized and transparent CBM. This concept-driven system significantly outperforms direct zero-shot FMs in predicting the need for intervention and enables real-time human correction of its reasoning. Critically, we demonstrate robust knowledge transfer: the model generalizes across different groups and successfully transfers the expertise of senior human facilitators to improve the performance of novices.

We present the Starlink Robot, the first mobile robotic platform equipped with Starlink satellite internet, comprehensive sensor suite including upward-facing camera, LiDAR, and IMU, designed to systematically study satellite communication performance during movement. Our multi-modal dataset captures synchronized communication metrics, motion dynamics, sky visibility, and 3D environmental context across diverse scenarios including steady-state motion, variable speeds, and different occlusion conditions. This platform and dataset enable researchers to develop motion-aware communication protocols, predict connectivity disruptions, and optimize satellite communication for emerging mobile applications from smartphones to autonomous vehicles. In this work, we use LEOViz for real-time satellite tracking and data collection. The starlink robot project is available at https://github.com/StarlinkRobot.</p></details> |  |

We study the active suppression of vibration caused by external sources such as power tools. We adopt the band-limited multiple Fourier linear combiner (BMFLC) algorithm to learn the vibration online and counter it by feedforward force control. We propose the damped BMFLC method, extending BMFLC with a novel adaptive step-size approach that improves the convergence time and noise resistance. Our logistic function-based damping mechanism reduces the effect of noise and enables larger learning rates. We evaluate our method on extensive simulation experiments with realistic time-varying multi-frequency vibration and real-world physical interaction experiments. The simulation experiments show that our method improves the suppression rate in comparison to the original BMFLC and its recursive least squares and Kalman filter-based extensions. Furthermore, our method is far more efficient than the latter two. We further validate the effectiveness of our method in real-world polishing experiments.

We develop the complete pipeline for a single vision sensor based multi-pedestrian detection and tracking, pose estimation, and monocular depth perception. Leveraging the real-world MOT17 dataset sequences, this study demonstrates how integrating human-pose estimation and depth cues enhances pedestrian trajectory prediction and identity maintenance, even under occlusions and dense crowds. Results show measurable improvements, including up to a 10% increase in identity preservation (IDF1), a 7% improvement in multiobject tracking accuracy (MOTA), and consistently high detection precision exceeding 85%, even in challenging scenarios. Notably, the system identifies vulnerable pedestrian groups supporting more socially aware and inclusive robot behaviour.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging theatrical methods, we use narrative objectives to direct a puppeteer in generating improvised robotic gestures that convey specific emotions. These improvisations are captured and curated to build a dataset of reusable movement templates for standalone playback in future autonomous performances. Initial trials demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, illustrating how the workflow enables precise sculpting of robotic gestures into coherent emotional arcs while revealing challenges posed by the robot's mechanical constraints. We argue that this practice-led framework provides a model for interdisciplinary teams creating socially expressive robot behaviours, contributing to (1) theatre as an interactive training ground for human-robot interaction and (2) co-creation methodologies between humans and machines.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted for presentation to International Conference on Social Robotics + AI (https://icsr2025.eu/)</p></details> |
| **[Rethink Repeatable Measures of Robot Performance with Statistical Query](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08216v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For a general standardized testing algorithm designed to evaluate a specific aspect of a robot's performance, several key expectations are commonly imposed. Beyond accuracy (i.e., closeness to a typically unknown ground-truth reference) and efficiency (i.e., feasibility within acceptable testing costs and equipment constraints), one particularly important attribute is repeatability. Repeatability refers to the ability to consistently obtain the same testing outcome when similar testing algorithms are executed on the same subject robot by different stakeholders, across different times or locations. However, achieving repeatable testing has become increasingly challenging as the components involved grow more complex, intelligent, diverse, and, most importantly, stochastic. While related efforts have addressed repeatability at ethical, hardware, and procedural levels, this study focuses specifically on repeatable testing at the algorithmic level. Specifically, we target the well-adopted class of testing algorithms in standardized evaluation: statistical query (SQ) algorithms (i.e., algorithms that estimate the expected value of a bounded function over a distribution using sampled data). We propose a lightweight, parameterized, and adaptive modification applicable to any SQ routine, whether based on Monte Carlo sampling, importance sampling, or adaptive importance sampling, that makes it provably repeatable, with guaranteed bounds on both accuracy and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across three representative scenarios: (i) established and widely adopted standardized testing of manipulators, (ii) emerging intelligent testing algorithms for operational risk assessment in automated vehicles, and (iii) developing use cases involving command tracking performance evaluation of humanoid robots in locomotion tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Joint Human-AI Inference in Robot Missions: A Confidence-Based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03293v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint human-AI inference holds immense potential to improve outcomes in human-supervised robot missions. Current day missions are generally in the AI-assisted setting, where the human operator makes the final inference based on the AI recommendation. However, due to failures in human judgement on when to accept or reject the AI recommendation, complementarity is rarely achieved. We investigate joint human-AI inference where the inference made with higher confidence is selected. Through a user study with N=100 participants on a representative simulated robot teleoperation task, specifically studying the inference of robots' control delays we show that: a) Joint inference accuracy is higher and its extent is regulated by the confidence calibration of the AI agent, and b) Humans change their inferences based on AI recommendations and the extent and direction of this change is also regulated by the confidence calibration of the AI agent. Interestingly, our results show that pairing poorly-calibrated AI-DSS with humans hurts performance instead of helping the team, reiterating the need for AI-based decision support systems with good metacognitive sensitivity. To the best of our knowledge, our study presents the first application of a maximum-confidence-based heuristic for joint human-AI inference within a simulated robot teleoperation task.</p></details> |  |

Despite their advantages for robots and Augmented Reality (AR) applications, they often disrupt the visual aesthetics of environments because they are visible to humans, making them unsuitable for non-intrusive use cases. To address this gap, this paper presents "iMarkers"-innovative, unobtrusive fiducial markers detectable exclusively by robots equipped with specialized sensors. These markers offer high flexibility in production, allowing customization of their visibility range and encoding algorithms to suit various demands. The paper also introduces the hardware designs and software algorithms developed for detecting iMarkers, highlighting their adaptability and robustness in the detection and recognition stages. Various evaluations have demonstrated the effectiveness of iMarkers compared to conventional (printed) and blended fiducial markers and confirmed their applicability in diverse robotics scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Force-Compliance MPC and Robot-User CBFs for Interactive Navigation and User-Robot Safety in Hexapod Guide Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03246v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guiding the visually impaired in complex environments requires real-time two-way interaction and safety assurance. We propose a Force-Compliance Model Predictive Control (FC-MPC) and Robot-User Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for force-compliant navigation and obstacle avoidance in Hexapod guide robots. FC-MPC enables two-way interaction by estimating user-applied forces and moments using the robot's dynamic model and the recursive least squares (RLS) method, and then adjusting the robot's movements accordingly, while Robot-User CBFs ensure the safety of both the user and the robot by handling static and dynamic obstacles, and employ weighted slack variables to overcome feasibility issues in complex dynamic environments. We also adopt an Eight-Way Connected DBSCAN method for obstacle clustering, reducing computational complexity from O(n2) to approximately O(n), enabling real-time local perception on resource-limited on-board robot computers. Obstacles are modeled using Minimum Bounding Ellipses (MBEs), and their trajectories are predicted through Kalman filtering. Implemented on the HexGuide robot, the system seamlessly integrates force compliance, autonomous navigation, and obstacle avoidance. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to adapt to user force commands while guaranteeing user and robot safety simultaneously during navigation in complex environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[ActionSink: Toward Precise Robot Manipulation with Dynamic Integration of Action Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03218v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance. To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e., ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos, called "action flow", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically, ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\% success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.</p></details> |  |

Traditional navigation systems often depend on static maps, which struggle to account for dynamic risks, such as a person emerging from a suddenly opening door. As a result, these systems tend to be reactive rather than anticipatory when handling dynamic hazards. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language models and vision-language models (VLMs) create new opportunities for proactive hazard avoidance. In this work, we propose a zero-shot language-as-cost mapping framework that leverages VLMs to interpret visual scenes, assess potential dynamic risks, and assign risk-aware navigation costs preemptively, enabling robots to anticipate hazards before they materialize. By integrating this language-based cost map with a geometric obstacle map, the robot not only identifies existing obstacles but also anticipates and proactively plans around potential hazards arising from environmental dynamics. Experiments in simulated and diverse dynamic environments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves navigation success rates and reduces hazard encounters, compared to reactive baseline planners.

In contrast, insect-scale aerial robots are limited to tracking non-aggressive trajectories with small body acceleration. This performance gap is contributed by a combination of low robot inertia, fast dynamics, uncertainty in flapping-wing aerodynamics, and high susceptibility to environmental disturbance. Executing highly dynamic maneuvers requires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the hardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and environmental uncertainty. Here, through designing a deep-learned robust tube model predictive controller, we showcase insect-like flight agility and robustness in a 750-millgram flapping-wing robot. Our model predictive controller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To achieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we design imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural network, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of central nervous system and motor neurons. Our robot demonstrates insect-like saccade movements with lateral speed and acceleration of 197 centimeters per second and 11.7 meters per second square, representing 447$\%$ and 255$\%$ improvement over prior results. The robot can also perform saccade maneuvers under 160 centimeters per second wind disturbance and large command-to-force mapping errors. Furthermore, it performs 10 consecutive body flips in 11 seconds - the most challenging maneuver among sub-gram flyers. These results represent a milestone in achieving insect-scale flight agility and inspire future investigations on sensing and compute autonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 26 supplementary pages, 6 main figures, 16 supplementary figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Human-Intent Modeling for Contextual Robot-to-Human Handovers of Arbitrary Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02982v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-robot object handover is a crucial element for assistive robots that aim to help people in their daily lives, including elderly care, hospitals, and factory floors. The existing approaches to solving these tasks rely on pre-selected target objects and do not contextualize human implicit and explicit preferences for handover, limiting natural and smooth interaction between humans and robots. These preferences can be related to the target object selection from the cluttered environment and to the way the robot should grasp the selected object to facilitate desirable human grasping during handovers. Therefore, this paper presents a unified approach that selects target distant objects using human verbal and non-verbal commands and performs the handover operation by contextualizing human implicit and explicit preferences to generate robot grasps and compliant handover motion sequences. We evaluate our integrated framework and its components through real-world experiments and user studies with arbitrary daily-life objects. The results of these evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline in handling object handover tasks by understanding human preferences.

Here, we demonstrate a fully AI-generated drone control system: with minimal human input, an artificial intelligence (AI) model authored all the code for a real-time, self-hosted drone command and control platform, which was deployed and demonstrated on a real drone in flight as well as a simulated virtual drone in the cloud. The system enables real-time mapping, flight telemetry, autonomous mission planning and execution, and safety protocolsall orchestrated through a web interface hosted directly on the drone itself. Not a single line of code was written by a human. We quantitatively benchmark system performance, code complexity, and development speed against prior, human-coded architectures, finding that AI-generated code can deliver functionally complete command-and-control stacks at orders-of-magnitude faster development cycles, though with identifiable current limitations related to specific model context window and reasoning depth. Our analysis uncovers the practical boundaries of AI-driven robot control code generation at current model scales, as well as emergent strengths and failure modes in AI-generated robotics code. This work sets a precedent for the autonomous creation of robot control systems and, more broadly, suggests a new paradigm for robotics engineeringone in which future robots may be largely co-designed, developed, and verified by artificial intelligence. In this initial work, a robot built a robot's brain.</p></details> |  |

Detecting microplastics and mapping their concentration in the wild remains one of the primary challenges in addressing this environmental issue. This paper introduces a novel robotic platform that automatically detects and chemically analyzes microplastics on beach surfaces. This mobile manipulator system scans areas for microplastics using a camera mounted on the robotic arm's end effector. The system effectively segments candidate microplastic particles on sand surfaces even in the presence of organic matter such as leaves and clams. Once a candidate microplastic particle is detected, the system steers a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic sensor onto the particle using both NIR and visual feedback to chemically analyze it in real-time. Through experiments in lab and beach environments, the system is shown to achieve an excellent positional precision in manipulation control and high microplastic classification accuracy.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

This paper introduces AeroSafe, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the efficacy of indoor air purification systems through a robotic cough emulator testbed and a digital-twins-based aerosol residence time analysis. Current portable air filters often overlook the concentrations of respiratory aerosols generated by coughs, posing a risk, particularly in high-exposure environments like healthcare facilities and public spaces. To address this gap, we present a robotic dual-agent physical emulator comprising a maneuverable mannequin simulating cough events and a portable air purifier autonomously responding to aerosols. The generated data from this emulator trains a digital twins model, combining a physics-based compartment model with a machine learning approach, using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and graph convolution layers. Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to predict aerosol concentration dynamics with a mean residence time prediction error within 35 seconds. The proposed system's real-time intervention strategies outperform static air filter placement, showcasing its potential in mitigating airborne pathogen risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025.

To this end, we ran Participatory Design workshops with animal welfare educators and children to identify key requirements for zoomorphic robots from their perspectives. Our findings encompass a zoomorphic robot's appearance, behavior, and features, as well as concepts for a narrative surrounding the robot. Through comparing and contrasting the two groups, we find the importance of: negative reactions to undesirable behavior from children; using the facial features and tail to provide cues signaling an animal's internal state; and a natural, furry appearance and texture. We also contribute some novel activities for Participatory Design with children, including branching storyboards inspired by thematic apperception tests and interactive narratives, and reflect on some of the key design challenges of achieving consensus between the groups, despite much overlap in their design concepts.</p></details> |  |

To address it, we introduce an explainable, physics-aware and end-to-end differentiable model which predicts the outcome of robot-terrain interaction from camera images, both on rigid and non-rigid terrain. The proposed MonoForce model consists of a black-box module which predicts robot-terrain interaction forces from onboard cameras, followed by a white-box module, which transforms these forces and a control signals into predicted trajectories, using only the laws of classical mechanics. The differentiable white-box module allows backpropagating the predicted trajectory errors into the black-box module, serving as a self-supervised loss that measures consistency between the predicted forces and ground-truth trajectories of the robot. Experimental evaluation on a public dataset and our data has shown that while the prediction capabilities are comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms on rigid terrain, MonoForce shows superior accuracy on non-rigid terrain such as tall grass or bushes. To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we release both the code and datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for IEEE IROS 2024.

However, existing assistive robotics solutions often assume that the human remains static or quasi-static, limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we present Manip4Care, a modular simulation pipeline that enables robotic manipulators to grasp and reposition human limbs effectively. Our approach features a physics simulator equipped with built-in techniques for grasping and repositioning while considering biomechanical and collision avoidance constraints. Our grasping method employs antipodal sampling with force closure to grasp limbs, and our repositioning system utilizes the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) and vector-field-based control method to generate motion trajectories under collision avoidance and biomechanical constraints. We evaluate this approach across various limb manipulation tasks in both supine and sitting positions and compare outcomes for different age groups with differing shoulder joint limits. Additionally, we demonstrate our approach for limb manipulation using a real-world mannequin and further showcase its effectiveness in bed bathing tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

We introduce a new virtual-model control scheme that enables knife rocking motion for robot manipulators, without pre-planned trajectories or precise information of the environment. Motion is generated through interconnection with virtual mechanisms, given by virtual springs, dampers, and masses arranged in a suitable way. Through analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that the controlled robot behavior settles into a periodic motion. Experiments with a Franka manipulator demonstrate robust cuts with five different vegetables, and sub-millimeter slice accuracy from 1 mm to 6 mm at nearly one cut per second. The same controller survives changes in knife shape and cutting board height, and adaptation to a different humanoid manipulator, demonstrating robustness and platform independence.</p></details> |  |

Like a child, the AGI robot would have to learn through input and experiences, constantly progressing and advancing its abilities over time. The AGI robot would require an intelligence more close to human's intelligence: it would have a self-aware consciousness that has the ability to solve problems, learn, and plan. Based on this approach an Intensional many-sorted First-order Logic (IFOL), as an extension of a standard FOL with Tarskian's semantics, is proposed in order to avoid the problems of standard 2-valued FOL with paradoxes (inconsistent formulae) and a necessity for robots to work with incomplete (unknown) knowledge as well. This is a more sophisticated version of IFOL with the same syntax but different semantics, able to deal with truth-ordering and knowledge-ordering as well, based on the well known Belnap's billatice with four truth-values that extend the set of classical two truth-values.</p></details> | 28 pages |

It can exert forces and operate in spaces far beyond those dictated by its own structural limits. However, for practical use, robots must autonomously attach multiple wires to the environment based on environmental recognition-an operation so difficult that many wire-driven robots remain restricted to specialized, pre-designed environments. Here, in this study, we propose a robot that autonomously connects multiple wires to the environment by employing a multi-small flying anchor system, as well as an RGB-D camera-based control and environmental recognition method. Each flying anchor is a drone with an anchoring mechanism at the wire tip, allowing the robot to attach wires by flying into position. Using the robot's RGB-D camera to identify suitable attachment points and a flying anchor position, the system can connect wires in environments that are not specially prepared, and can also attach multiple wires simultaneously. Through this approach, a wire-driven robot can autonomously attach its wires to the environment, thereby realizing the benefits of wire-driven operation at any location.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS 2025, website - https://shin0805.github.io/flying-anchor/, YouTube - https://youtu.be/BXdlXf7BNQQ</p></details> |
| **[Failure-Aware Multi-Robot Coordination for Resilient and Adaptive Target Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02529v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot coordination is crucial for autonomous systems, yet real-world deployments often encounter various failures. These include both temporary and permanent disruptions in sensing and communication, which can significantly degrade system robustness and performance if not explicitly modeled. Despite its practical importance, failure-aware coordination remains underexplored in the literature. To bridge the gap between idealized conditions and the complexities of real-world environments, we propose a unified failure-aware coordination framework designed to enable resilient and adaptive multi-robot target tracking under both temporary and permanent failure conditions. Our approach systematically distinguishes between two classes of failures: (1) probabilistic and temporary disruptions, where robots recover from intermittent sensing or communication losses by dynamically adapting paths and avoiding inferred danger zones, and (2) permanent failures, where robots lose sensing or communication capabilities irreversibly, requiring sustained, decentralized behavioral adaptation. To handle these scenarios, the robot team is partitioned into subgroups. Robots that remain connected form a communication group and collaboratively plan using partially centralized nonlinear optimization. Robots experiencing permanent disconnection or failure continue to operate independently through decentralized or individual optimization, allowing them to contribute to the task within their local context. We extensively evaluate our method across a range of benchmark variations and conduct a comprehensive assessment under diverse real-world failure scenarios. Results show that our framework consistently achieves robust performance in realistic environments with unknown danger zones, offering a practical and generalizable solution for the multi-robot systems community.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.

In this work, we present a novel framework for enhancing the attention of the iCub humanoid robot by integrating advanced perceptual abilities to recognise social cues, understand surroundings through generative models, such as ChatGPT, and respond with contextually appropriate social behaviour. Specifically, we propose an interaction task implementing a narrative protocol (storytelling task) in which the human and the robot create a short imaginary story together, exchanging in turn cubes with creative images placed on them. To validate the protocol and the framework, experiments were performed to quantify the degree of usability and the quality of experience perceived by participants interacting with the system. Such a system can be beneficial in promoting effective human robot collaborations, especially in assistance, education and rehabilitation scenarios where the social awareness and the robot responsiveness play a pivotal role.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformable Modular Robots: A CPG-Based Approach to Independent and Collective Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13674v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modular robotics enables the development of versatile and adaptive robotic systems with autonomous reconfiguration. This paper presents a modular robotic system in which each module has independent actuation, battery power, and control, allowing both individual mobility and coordinated locomotion. A hierarchical Central Pattern Generator (CPG) framework governs motion, with a low-level CPG controlling individual modules and a high-level CPG synchronizing inter-module coordination, enabling smooth transitions between independent and collective behaviors. To validate the system, we conduct simulations in MuJoCo and hardware experiments, evaluating locomotion across different configurations. We first analyze single-module motion, followed by two-module cooperative locomotion. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the CPG-based control framework in achieving robust, flexible, and scalable locomotion. The proposed modular architecture has potential applications in search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and autonomous exploration, where adaptability and reconfigurability are essential.</p></details> |  |

Robots must analyze interactions with objects to ensure safety and facilitate meaningful workflows. One critical aspect is human/object detection, where the contacted object is identified. Past research introduced binary machine learning classifiers to distinguish between soft and hard objects. This study improves upon those results by evaluating three-class human/object detection models, offering more detailed contact analysis. A dataset was collected using the Franka Emika Panda robot manipulator, exploring preprocessing strategies for time-series analysis. Models including LSTM, GRU, and Transformers were trained on these datasets. The best-performing model achieved 91.11\% accuracy during real-time testing, demonstrating the feasibility of multi-class detection models. Additionally, a comparison of preprocessing strategies suggests a sliding window approach is optimal for this task.</p></details> |  |

Cholecystectomy, the gallbladder removal, is particularly well-suited for automation due to its standardized procedural steps and distinct anatomical boundaries. A key challenge in automating this procedure is dissecting with accuracy and adaptability. This paper presents a vision-based autonomous robotic dissection architecture that integrates real-time segmentation, keypoint detection, grasping and stretching the gallbladder with the left arm, and dissecting with the other arm. We introduce an improved segmentation dataset based on videos of robotic cholecystectomy performed by various surgeons, incorporating a new ``liver bed'' class to enhance boundary tracking after multiple rounds of dissection. Our system employs state-of-the-art segmentation models and an adaptive boundary extraction method that maintains accuracy despite tissue deformations and visual variations. Moreover, we implemented an automated grasping and pulling strategy to optimize tissue tension before dissection upon our previous work. Ex vivo evaluations on porcine livers demonstrate that our framework significantly improves dissection precision and consistency, marking a step toward fully autonomous robotic cholecystectomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Machine Learning-based Test Oracle for Autonomous Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02407v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots are increasingly becoming part of our daily lives, interacting with both the environment and humans to perform their tasks. The software of such robots often undergoes upgrades, for example, to add new functionalities, fix bugs, or delete obsolete functionalities. As a result, regression testing of robot software becomes necessary. However, determining the expected correct behavior of robots (i.e., a test oracle) is challenging due to the potentially unknown environments in which the robots must operate. To address this challenge, machine learning (ML)-based test oracles present a viable solution. This paper reports on the development of a test oracle to support regression testing of autonomous mobile robots built by PAL Robotics (Spain), using quantum machine learning (QML), which enables faster training and the construction of more precise test oracles. Specifically, we propose a hybrid framework, QuReBot, that combines both quantum reservoir computing (QRC) and a simple neural network, inspired by residual connection, to predict the expected behavior of a robot. Results show that QRC alone fails to converge in our case, yielding high prediction error. In contrast, QuReBot converges and achieves 15% reduction of prediction error compared to the classical neural network baseline. Finally, we further examine QuReBot under different configurations and offer practical guidance on optimal settings to support future robot software testing.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) enable the use of natural language instructions to condition visual input and control robots in a wider range of environments. However, existing methods require a large amount of data to fine-tune VLMs for operating in unseen environments. In this paper, we present a framework that learns object-arrangement tasks from just a few demonstrations. We propose a two-stage framework that divides object-arrangement tasks into a target localization stage, for picking the object, and a region determination stage for placing the object. We present an instance-level semantic fusion module that aligns the instance-level image crops with the text embedding, enabling the model to identify the target objects defined by the natural language instructions. We validate our method on both simulation and real-world robotic environments. Our method, fine-tuned with a few demonstrations, improves generalization capability and demonstrates zero-shot ability in real-robot manipulation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages,18 figures,2 tables</p></details> |

Given that human behavior can be unpredictable and that AMRs may not have been trained to handle all possible unknown and uncertain behaviors, it is important to test AMRs under a wide range of human interactions to ensure their safe behavior. Moreover, testing in real environments with actual AMRs and humans is often costly, impractical, and potentially hazardous (e.g., it could result in human injury). To this end, we propose a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based testing approach (RVSG) for industrial AMRs developed by PAL Robotics in Spain. Based on the functional and safety requirements, RVSG uses the VLM to generate diverse human behaviors that violate these requirements. We evaluated RVSG with several requirements and navigation routes in a simulator using the latest AMR from PAL Robotics. Our results show that, compared with the baseline, RVSG can effectively generate requirement-violating scenarios. Moreover, RVSG-generated scenarios increase variability in robot behavior, thereby helping reveal their uncertain behaviors.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents Underwater Robot Self-Organizing Autonomy (UROSA), a groundbreaking architecture leveraging distributed Large Language Model AI agents integrated within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) framework to enable advanced cognitive capabilities in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. UROSA decentralises cognition into specialised AI agents responsible for multimodal perception, adaptive reasoning, dynamic mission planning, and real-time decision-making. Central innovations include flexible agents dynamically adapting their roles, retrieval-augmented generation utilising vector databases for efficient knowledge management, reinforcement learning-driven behavioural optimisation, and autonomous on-the-fly ROS 2 node generation for runtime functional extensibility. Extensive empirical validation demonstrates UROSA's promising adaptability and reliability through realistic underwater missions in simulation and real-world deployments, showing significant advantages over traditional rule-based architectures in handling unforeseen scenarios, environmental uncertainties, and novel mission objectives. This work not only advances underwater autonomy but also establishes a scalable, safe, and versatile cognitive robotics framework capable of generalising to a diverse array of real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

This study explores the control of such underactuated robots using constrained reinforcement learning, addressing their inherent instability, lack of arms, and limited foot actuation. We present a methodology that leverages Constraints-as-Terminations and domain randomization techniques to enable sim-to-real transfer. Through a series of qualitative and quantitative experiments, we evaluate our approach in terms of balance maintenance, velocity control, and responses to slip and push disturbances. Additionally, we analyze autonomy through metrics like the cost of transport and ground reaction force. Our method advances robust control strategies for point-foot bipedal robots, offering insights into broader locomotion.</p></details> |  |

However, training these models often relies on large-scale user-specific data, raising concerns about privacy and security, which in turn limits their broader adoption. To address this, we propose FedVLA, the first federated VLA learning framework, enabling distributed model training that preserves data privacy without compromising performance. Our framework integrates task-aware representation learning, adaptive expert selection, and expert-driven federated aggregation, enabling efficient and privacy-preserving training of VLA models. Specifically, we introduce an Instruction Oriented Scene-Parsing mechanism, which decomposes and enhances object-level features based on task instructions, improving contextual understanding. To effectively learn diverse task patterns, we design a Dual Gating Mixture-of-Experts (DGMoE) mechanism, where not only input tokens but also self-aware experts adaptively decide their activation. Finally, we propose an Expert-Driven Aggregation strategy at the federated server, where model aggregation is guided by activated experts, ensuring effective cross-client knowledge transfer.Extensive simulations and real-world robotic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposals. Notably, DGMoE significantly improves computational efficiency compared to its vanilla counterpart, while FedVLA achieves task success rates comparable to centralized training, effectively preserving data privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, their application to multi-person tracking (MPT) has been limited due to data scarcity and the inherent difficulty of distinguishing individuals. In this study, we propose a cooperative MPT system that utilizes co-located RGB and thermal cameras, where pseudo-annotations (bounding boxes and person IDs) are used to train both RGB and thermal trackers. Evaluation experiments demonstrate that the thermal tracker performs robustly in both bright and dark environments. Moreover, the results suggest that a tracker-switching strategy -- guided by a binary brightness classifier -- is more effective for information integration than a tracker-fusion approach. As an application example, we present an image change pattern recognition (ICPR) method, the ``human-as-landmark,'' which combines two key properties: the thermal recognizability of humans in dark environments and the rich landmark characteristics -- appearance, geometry, and semantics -- of static objects (occluders). Whereas conventional SLAM focuses on mapping static landmarks in well-lit environments, the present study takes a first step toward a new Human-Only SLAM paradigm, ``Dynamic-Dark SLAM,'' which aims to map even dynamic landmarks in complete darkness. Additionally, this study demonstrates that knowledge transfer between thermal and depth modalities enables reliable person tracking using low-resolution 3D LiDAR data without RGB input, contributing an important advance toward cross-robot SLAM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 11 figures, technical report</p></details> |

To this end, we pioneer in probing the cross-device (cameras & robotics) grasping policy in the 3D open world. Specifically, we construct two real-world grasping setups, employing robotic arms and cameras from completely different manufacturers. To minimize domain differences in point clouds from diverse cameras, we adopt clustering methods to generate 3D object proposals. However, existing clustering methods are limited to closed-set scenarios, which confines the robotic graspable object categories and ossifies the deployment scenarios. To extend these methods to open-world settings, we introduce the SSGC-Seg module that enables category-agnostic 3D object detection. The proposed module transforms the original multi-class semantic information into binary semantic cues-foreground and background by analyzing the SoftMax value of each point, and then clusters the foreground points based on geometric information to form initial object proposals. Furthermore, ScoreNet{\ddag} is designed to score each detection result, and the robotic arm prioritizes grasping the object with the highest confidence score. Experiments on two different types of setups highlight the effectiveness and robustness of our policy for cross-device robotics grasping research. Our code is provided in the supplementary and will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Friction-Aware Safety Locomotion for Wheeled-legged Robots using Vision Language Models and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09845v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling Wheeled-legged robots is challenging especially on slippery surfaces due to their dependence on continuous ground contact. Unlike quadrupeds or bipeds, which can leverage multiple fixed contact points for recovery, wheeled-legged robots are highly susceptible to slip, where even momentary loss of traction can result in irrecoverable instability. Anticipating ground physical properties such as friction before contact would allow proactive control adjustments, reducing slip risk. In this paper, we propose a friction-aware safety locomotion framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) policy. Our method employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to estimate the Coefficient of Friction (CoF), which is then explicitly incorporated into the RL policy. This enables the robot to adapt its speed based on predicted friction conditions before contact. The framework is validated through experiments in both simulation and on a physical customized Wheeled Inverted Pendulum (WIP). Experimental results show that our approach successfully completes trajectory tracking tasks on slippery surfaces, whereas baseline methods relying solely on proprioceptive feedback fail. These findings highlight the importance and effectiveness of explicitly predicting and utilizing ground friction information for safe locomotion. They also point to a promising research direction in exploring the use of VLMs for estimating ground conditions, which remains a significant challenge for purely vision-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Humanoids 2025</p></details> |

This inward focus results, in part, from the complexity of the task and largely confines modular robots to sterile laboratory settings. The latest generation of truss modular robots, such as the Variable Topology Truss and the Truss Link, have begun to focus outward and reveal a key insight: the environment is not just a backdrop; it is a tool. In this work, we shift the paradigm from building better robots to building better robot environment interactions for modular truss robots. We study how modular robots can effectively exploit their surroundings to achieve faster locomotion, adaptive self-reconfiguration, and complex three-dimensional assembly from simple two-dimensional robot assemblies. By using environment features -- ledges, gaps, and slopes -- we show how the environment can extend the robots' capabilities. Nature has long mastered this principle: organisms not only adapt, but exploit their environments to their advantage. Robots must learn to do the same. This study is a step towards modular robotic systems that transcend their limitations by exploiting environmental features.</p></details> |  |

However, the success of these surgeries depends heavily on the robotic system ability to accurately interpret the intentions of the surgical trainee or even surgeons. One critical factor impacting intent recognition is the cognitive workload experienced during the procedure. In our recent research project, we are building an intelligent adaptive system to monitor cognitive workload and improve learning outcomes in robot-assisted surgery. The project will focus on achieving a semantic understanding of surgeon intents and monitoring their mental state through an intelligent multi-modal assistive framework. This system will utilize brain activity, heart rate, muscle activity, and eye tracking to enhance intent recognition, even in mentally demanding situations. By improving the robotic system ability to interpret the surgeons intentions, we can further enhance the benefits of robot-assisted surgery and improve surgery outcomes.</p></details> |  |

However, segmentation models trained on static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work, we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than 144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at http://topics.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Robotic Manipulation Generalization with Minimal Costly Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19516v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied AI intensifies the demand for diverse manipulation demonstrations. However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the RoboTron-Craft, a stage-divided and cost-effective pipeline for realistic manipulation generation. Base on this, the RoboTron-Platter method is introduced, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.

However, large-scale demonstrations captured by remote operation tend to take extremely high costs and fail to scale up the data size in an efficient manner. Sampling the episodes under a simulated environment is a promising way for large-scale collection while existing simulators fail to high-fidelity modeling on texture and physics. To address these limitations, we introduce the RoboGSim, a real2sim2real robotic simulator, powered by 3D Gaussian Splatting and the physics engine. RoboGSim mainly includes four parts: Gaussian Reconstructor, Digital Twins Builder, Scene Composer, and Interactive Engine. It can synthesize the simulated data with novel views, objects, trajectories, and scenes. RoboGSim also provides an online, reproducible, and safe evaluation for different manipulation policies. The real2sim and sim2real transfer experiments show a high consistency in the texture and physics. We compared the test results of RoboGSim data and real robot data on both RoboGSim and real robot platforms. The experimental results show that the RoboGSim data model can achieve zero-shot performance on the real robot, with results comparable to real robot data. Additionally, in experiments with novel perspectives and novel scenes, the RoboGSim data model performed even better on the real robot than the real robot data model. This not only helps reduce the sim2real gap but also addresses the limitations of real robot data collection, such as its single-source and high cost. We hope RoboGSim serves as a closed-loop simulator for fair comparison on policy learning. More information can be found on our project page https://robogsim.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional flow-matching methods struggle with multi-modality, often collapsing to averaged or ambiguous behaviors in complex manipulation tasks. To address this, we propose the Variational Flow-Matching Policy (VFP), which introduces a variational latent prior for mode-aware action generation and effectively captures both task-level and trajectory-level multi-modality. VFP further incorporates Kantorovich Optimal Transport (K-OT) for distribution-level alignment and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder for mode specialization and efficient inference. We comprehensively evaluate VFP on 41 tasks across four benchmark environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and sampling efficiency in both task and path multi-modality settings. Results show that VFP achieves a $49\%$ relative improvement in task success rate over standard flow-based baselines, while maintaining fast inference and compact model size.

While current humanoids bear human-like appearances, none have embodied true humaneness, remaining distant from achieving human-like to human-level intelligence. The rapid recent advancements in generative AI and (multimodal) large language models have further reignited and escalated interest in humanoids towards real-time, interactive, and multimodal designs and applications, such as fostering humanoid workers, advisers, educators, medical professionals, caregivers, and receptionists. These unveil boundless opportunities of transforming 1) AI robotics into a research era of humanoid AI, and 2) AI robots into new-generation humanoid AI robots (AI humanoids). Our unique and comprehensive review of about 30 reported humanoids discloses a systematic terminology and a paradigmatic landscape of human-looking to human-like and human-level humanoids. It inspires comprehensive new perspectives and directions of humanoid AI as an area: transitioning from human-looking to humane humanoids, humanizing humanoids with functional and nonfunctional specifications, and cultivating technical and actionable advances of AI humanoids.

However, BC faces significant challenges when applied to heterogeneous datasets, such as visual shift with different camera poses or object appearances, where performance degrades despite the benefits of learning at scale. This stems from BC's tendency to overfit individual demonstrations rather than capture shared structure, limiting generalization. To address this, we introduce Contrastive Learning via Action Sequence Supervision (CLASS), a method for learning behavioral representations from demonstrations using supervised contrastive learning. CLASS leverages weak supervision from similar action sequences identified via Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and optimizes a soft InfoNCE loss with similarity-weighted positive pairs. We evaluate CLASS on 5 simulation benchmarks and 3 real-world tasks to achieve competitive results using retrieval-based control with representations only. Most notably, for downstream policy learning under significant visual shifts, Diffusion Policy with CLASS pre-training achieves an average success rate of 75%, while all other baseline methods fail to perform competitively.

| **[HALO: Human Preference Aligned Offline Reward Learning for Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01539v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce HALO, a novel Offline Reward Learning algorithm that quantifies human intuition in navigation into a vision-based reward function for robot navigation. HALO learns a reward model from offline data, leveraging expert trajectories collected from mobile robots. During training, actions are uniformly sampled around a reference action and ranked using preference scores derived from a Boltzmann distribution centered on the preferred action, and shaped based on binary user feedback to intuitive navigation queries. The reward model is trained via the Plackett-Luce loss to align with these ranked preferences. To demonstrate the effectiveness of HALO, we deploy its reward model in two downstream applications: (i) an offline learned policy trained directly on the HALO-derived rewards, and (ii) a model-predictive-control (MPC) based planner that incorporates the HALO reward as an additional cost term. This showcases the versatility of HALO across both learning-based and classical navigation frameworks. Our real-world deployments on a Clearpath Husky across diverse scenarios demonstrate that policies trained with HALO generalize effectively to unseen environments and hardware setups not present in the training data. HALO outperforms state-of-the-art vision-based navigation methods, achieving at least a 33.3% improvement in success rate, a 12.9% reduction in normalized trajectory length, and a 26.6% reduction in Frechet distance compared to human expert trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physically-based Lighting Augmentation for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01442v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in data augmentation, policies trained via imitation learning still struggle to generalize across environmental variations such as lighting changes. To address this, we propose the first framework that leverages physically-based inverse rendering for lighting augmentation on real-world human demonstrations. Specifically, inverse rendering decomposes the first frame in each demonstration into geometric (surface normal, depth) and material (albedo, roughness, metallic) properties, which are then used to render appearance changes under different lighting. To ensure consistent augmentation across each demonstration, we fine-tune Stable Video Diffusion on robot execution videos for temporal lighting propagation. We evaluate our framework by measuring the structural and temporal consistency of the augmented sequences, and by assessing its effectiveness in reducing the behavior cloning generalization gap (40.1%) on a 7-DoF robot across 6 lighting conditions using 720 real-world evaluations. We further showcase three downstream applications enabled by the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by human metacognitive learning and creative problem-solving, we address this limitation by exploring a fundamental question: Can LLMs be empowered with metacognitive capabilities to reason, reflect, and create, thereby enhancing their ability to perform robotic tasks with minimal demonstrations? In this paper, we present a framework that integrates metacognitive learning into LLM-powered multi-robot collaboration. The system equips the LLM-powered robotic agents with a skill decomposition and self-reflection mechanism that identifies modular skills from prior tasks, reflects on failures in unseen task scenarios, and synthesizes effective new solutions. We propose a more challenging robotic benchmark task and evaluate our framework on the existing benchmark and the novel task. Experimental results show that our metacognitive learning framework significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, we observe that the framework can generate solutions that differ from the ground truth yet still successfully complete the tasks. These findings support our hypothesis that metacognitive learning can foster creativity in robotic planning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods for humanoid robots neglect morphological symmetry of the robot, leading to uncoordinated and suboptimal behaviors. Inspired by human motor control, we propose Symmetry Equivariant Policy (SE-Policy), a new DRL framework that embeds strict symmetry equivariance in the actor and symmetry invariance in the critic without additional hyperparameters. SE-Policy enforces consistent behaviors across symmetric observations, producing temporally and spatially coordinated motions with higher task performance. Extensive experiments on velocity tracking tasks, conducted in both simulation and real-world deployment with the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrate that SE-Policy improves tracking accuracy by up to 40% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while achieving superior spatial-temporal coordination. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of SE-Policy and its broad applicability to humanoid robots.</p></details> |  |

However, effective navigation and situational awareness depend on users' prior knowledge of the environment, limiting the usefulness of these systems for exploring unfamiliar places. We explore how integrating location-aware LLM-based narrative capabilities into a mobile robot can support remote exploration. We developed a prototype system, called NarraGuide, that provides narrative guidance for users to explore and learn about a remote place through a dialogue-based interface. We deployed our prototype in a geology museum, where remote participants (n=20) used the robot to tour the museum. Our findings reveal how users perceived the robot's role, engaged in dialogue in the tour, and expressed preferences for bystander encountering. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLM-enabled robotic capabilities to deliver location-aware narrative guidance and enrich the experience of exploring remote environments.</p></details> |  |

Robots must earn the trust of human operators in order to be effective collaborators in safety-critical tasks, specifically those where robots operate in human environments. We propose the human-robot red teaming paradigm for safety-aware reasoning. We expect humans and robots to work together to challenge assumptions about an environment and explore the space of hazards that may arise. This exploration will enable robots to perform safety-aware reasoning, specifically hazard identification, risk assessment, risk mitigation, and safety reporting. We demonstrate that: (a) human-robot red teaming allows human-robot teams to plan to perform tasks safely in a variety of domains, and (b) robots with different embodiments can learn to operate safely in two different environments -- a lunar habitat and a household -- with varying definitions of safety. Taken together, our work on human-robot red teaming for safety-aware reasoning demonstrates the feasibility of this approach for safely operating and promoting trust on human-robot teams in safety-critical problem domains.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

However, current approaches are typically data-inefficient, underscoring the need for improved models that require realistically sized benchmarks to evaluate their efficiency. To address this, we introduce the LAMBDA ({\lambda}) benchmark-Long-horizon Actions for Mobile-manipulation Benchmarking of Directed Activities-which evaluates the data efficiency of models on language-conditioned, long-horizon, multi-room, multi-floor, pick-and-place tasks using a dataset of manageable size, more feasible for collection. Our benchmark includes 571 human-collected demonstrations that provide realism and diversity in simulated and real-world settings. Unlike planner-generated data, these trajectories offer natural variability and replay-verifiability, ensuring robust learning and evaluation. We leverage {\lambda} to benchmark current end-to-end learning methods and a modular neuro-symbolic approach that combines foundation models with task and motion planning. We find that learning methods, even when pretrained, yield lower success rates, while a neuro-symbolic method performs significantly better and requires less data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025.

In this paper, we use video generation as a proxy for robot policy learning to address both limitations simultaneously. We propose Video Policy, a modular framework that combines video and action generation that can be trained end-to-end. Our results demonstrate that learning to generate videos of robot behavior allows for the extraction of policies with minimal demonstration data, significantly improving robustness and sample efficiency. Our method shows strong generalization to unseen objects, backgrounds, and tasks, both in simulation and the real world. We further highlight that task success is closely tied to the generated video, with action-free video data providing critical benefits for generalizing to novel tasks. By leveraging large-scale video generative models, we achieve superior performance compared to traditional behavior cloning, paving the way for more scalable and data-efficient robot policy learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[On-Device Diffusion Transformer Policy for Efficient Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00697v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Policies have significantly advanced robotic manipulation tasks via imitation learning, but their application on resource-constrained mobile platforms remains challenging due to computational inefficiency and extensive memory footprint. In this paper, we propose LightDP, a novel framework specifically designed to accelerate Diffusion Policies for real-time deployment on mobile devices. LightDP addresses the computational bottleneck through two core strategies: network compression of the denoising modules and reduction of the required sampling steps. We first conduct an extensive computational analysis on existing Diffusion Policy architectures, identifying the denoising network as the primary contributor to latency. To overcome performance degradation typically associated with conventional pruning methods, we introduce a unified pruning and retraining pipeline, optimizing the model's post-pruning recoverability explicitly. Furthermore, we combine pruning techniques with consistency distillation to effectively reduce sampling steps while maintaining action prediction accuracy. Experimental evaluations on the standard datasets, \ie, PushT, Robomimic, CALVIN, and LIBERO, demonstrate that LightDP achieves real-time action prediction on mobile devices with competitive performance, marking an important step toward practical deployment of diffusion-based policies in resource-limited environments. Extensive real-world experiments also show the proposed LightDP can achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Furthermore, to ensure that the object is not detached from the suction cup during the collaboration, an additional control signal is proposed, which is based on a barrier artificial potential.

Deep neural networks have shown remarkable success in grasp synthesis by learning rich and abstract representations of objects. When deployed at the edge, these models can enable low-latency, low-power inference, making real-time grasping feasible in resource-constrained environments. This work implements Heatmap-Guided Grasp Detection, an end-to-end framework for the detection of 6-Dof grasp poses, on the GAP9 RISC-V System-on-Chip. The model is optimised using hardware-aware techniques, including input dimensionality reduction, model partitioning, and quantisation.

| **[A Whole-Body Motion Imitation Framework from Human Data for Full-Size Humanoid Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00362v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion imitation is a pivotal and effective approach for humanoid robots to achieve a more diverse range of complex and expressive movements, making their performances more human-like. However, the significant differences in kinematics and dynamics between humanoid robots and humans present a major challenge in accurately imitating motion while maintaining balance. In this paper, we propose a novel whole-body motion imitation framework for a full-size humanoid robot. The proposed method employs contact-aware whole-body motion retargeting to mimic human motion and provide initial values for reference trajectories, and the non-linear centroidal model predictive controller ensures the motion accuracy while maintaining balance and overcoming external disturbances in real time. The assistance of the whole-body controller allows for more precise torque control. Experiments have been conducted to imitate a variety of human motions both in simulation and in a real-world humanoid robot. These experiments demonstrate the capability of performing with accuracy and adaptability, which validates the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[TOP: Time Optimization Policy for Stable and Accurate Standing Manipulation with Humanoid Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00355v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots have the potential capability to perform a diverse range of manipulation tasks, but this is based on a robust and precise standing controller. Existing methods are either ill-suited to precisely control high-dimensional upper-body joints, or difficult to ensure both robustness and accuracy, especially when upper-body motions are fast. This paper proposes a novel time optimization policy (TOP), to train a standing manipulation control model that ensures balance, precision, and time efficiency simultaneously, with the idea of adjusting the time trajectory of upper-body motions but not only strengthening the disturbance resistance of the lower-body. Our approach consists of three parts. Firstly, we utilize motion prior to represent upper-body motions to enhance the coordination ability between the upper and lower-body by training a variational autoencoder (VAE). Then we decouple the whole-body control into an upper-body PD controller for precision and a lower-body RL controller to enhance robust stability. Finally, we train TOP method in conjunction with the decoupled controller and VAE to reduce the balance burden resulting from fast upper-body motions that would destabilize the robot and exceed the capabilities of the lower-body RL policy. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated via both simulation and real world experiments, which demonstrate the superiority on standing manipulation tasks stably and accurately.

Such "digital twins" are useful for simulations, virtual reality, marketing, robot policy fine-tuning, and part inspection. 3D object scanning usually requires multi-camera arrays, precise laser scanners, or robot wrist-mounted cameras, which have restricted workspaces. We propose Omni-Scan, a pipeline for producing high-quality 3D Gaussian Splat models using a bi-manual robot that grasps an object with one gripper and rotates the object with respect to a stationary camera. The object is then re-grasped by a second gripper to expose surfaces that were occluded by the first gripper. We present the Omni-Scan robot pipeline using DepthAny-thing, Segment Anything, as well as RAFT optical flow models to identify and isolate objects held by a robot gripper while removing the gripper and the background. We then modify the 3DGS training pipeline to support concatenated datasets with gripper occlusion, producing an omni-directional (360 degree view) model of the object. We apply Omni-Scan to part defect inspection, finding that it can identify visual or geometric defects in 12 different industrial and household objects with an average accuracy of 83%.

| **[H-RDT: Human Manipulation Enhanced Bimanual Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23523v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning for robotic manipulation faces a fundamental challenge: the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent robotic foundation models often pre-train on cross-embodiment robot datasets to increase data scale, while they face significant limitations as the diverse morphologies and action spaces across different robot embodiments make unified training challenging. In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics Diffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data to enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale egocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations provide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and can benefit robotic policy learning. We introduce a two-stage training paradigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data, and (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action encoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B parameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions. Extensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments, single-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and robustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from scratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving significant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in simulation and real-world experiments, respectively. The results validate our core hypothesis that human manipulation data can serve as a powerful foundation for learning bimanual robotic manipulation policies.</p></details> |  |

Despite their significant capabilities, VLA models introduce new attack surfaces. This paper systematically evaluates their robustness. Recognizing the unique demands of robotic execution, our attack objectives target the inherent spatial and functional characteristics of robotic systems. In particular, we introduce two untargeted attack objectives that leverage spatial foundations to destabilize robotic actions, and a targeted attack objective that manipulates the robotic trajectory. Additionally, we design an adversarial patch generation approach that places a small, colorful patch within the camera's view, effectively executing the attack in both digital and physical environments. Our evaluation reveals a marked degradation in task success rates, with up to a 100\% reduction across a suite of simulated robotic tasks, highlighting critical security gaps in current VLA architectures. By unveiling these vulnerabilities and proposing actionable evaluation metrics, we advance both the understanding and enhancement of safety for VLA-based robotic systems, underscoring the necessity for continuously developing robust defense strategies prior to physical-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV camera ready; Github: https://github.com/William-wAng618/roboticAttack Homepage: https://vlaattacker.github.io/</p></details> |

At the same time, \emph{massively parallelized training} has gained popularity, not only for significantly accelerating data collection through GPU-accelerated simulation but also for enabling diverse data collection across multiple tasks by simulating heterogeneous scenes in parallel. However, existing MTRL research has largely been limited to off-policy methods like SAC in the low-parallelization regime. MTRL could capitalize on the higher asymptotic performance of on-policy algorithms, whose batches require data from the current policy, and as a result, take advantage of massive parallelization offered by GPU-accelerated simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce a massively parallelized $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{T}$ask $\textbf{Bench}$mark for robotics (MTBench), an open-sourced benchmark featuring a broad distribution of 50 manipulation tasks and 20 locomotion tasks, implemented using the GPU-accelerated simulator IsaacGym. MTBench also includes four base RL algorithms combined with seven state-of-the-art MTRL algorithms and architectures, providing a unified framework for evaluating their performance. Our extensive experiments highlight the superior speed of evaluating MTRL approaches using MTBench, while also uncovering unique challenges that arise from combining massive parallelism with MTRL.

However, existing robotic middleware often struggles to meet the diverse communication demands, optimize data transmission efficiency, and maintain scheduling determinism between Orin computing units in large-scale L4 autonomous vehicle deployments. This paper presents RIMAOS2C, a service discovery-based hybrid network communication middleware designed to tackle these challenges.

| **[Evaluating Uncertainty and Quality of Visual Language Action-enabled Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17049v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Language Action (VLA) models are a multi-modal class of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that integrate visual perception, natural language understanding, and action planning to enable agents to interpret their environment, comprehend instructions, and perform embodied tasks autonomously. Recently, significant progress has been made to advance this field. These kinds of models are typically evaluated through task success rates, which fail to capture the quality of task execution and the mode's confidence in its decisions. In this paper, we propose eight uncertainty metrics and five quality metrics specifically designed for VLA models for robotic manipulation tasks. We assess their effectiveness through a large-scale empirical study involving 908 successful task executions from three state-of-the-art VLA models across four representative robotic manipulation tasks. Human domain experts manually labeled task quality, allowing us to analyze the correlation between our proposed metrics and expert judgments. The results reveal that several metrics show moderate to strong correlation with human assessments, highlighting their utility for evaluating task quality and model confidence. Furthermore, we found that some of the metrics can discriminate between high-, medium-, and low-quality executions from unsuccessful tasks, which can be interesting when test oracles are not available. Our findings challenge the adequacy of current evaluation practices that rely solely on binary success rates and pave the way for improved real-time monitoring and adaptive enhancement of VLA-enabled robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose the Cooperative and Asynchronous Transformer-based Mission Planning (CATMiP) framework, which leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to coordinate distributed decision making among agents with diverse sensing, motion, and actuation capabilities, operating under sporadic ad hoc communication. A Class-based Macro-Action Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (CMacDec-POMDP) is also formulated to effectively model asynchronous decision-making for heterogeneous teams of agents. The framework utilizes an asynchronous centralized training and distributed execution scheme, enabled by the proposed Asynchronous Multi-Agent Transformer (AMAT) architecture. This design allows a single trained model to generalize to larger environments and accommodate varying team sizes and compositions. We evaluate CATMiP in a 2D grid-world simulation environment and compare its performance against planning-based exploration methods. Results demonstrate CATMiP's superior efficiency, scalability, and robustness to communication dropouts and input noise, highlighting its potential for real-world heterogeneous mobile robot systems.

UX is a multi-faceted measure encompassing aspects such as sentiment and engagement, yet existing methods often focus on these individually. This study proposes a UX estimation method for HRI by leveraging multimodal social signals. We construct a UX dataset and develop a Transformer-based model that utilizes facial expressions and voice for estimation. Unlike conventional models that rely on momentary observations, our approach captures both short- and long-term interaction patterns using a multi-instance learning framework. This enables the model to capture temporal dynamics in UX, providing a more holistic representation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems 2025 (IROS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[BarlowWalk: Self-supervised Representation Learning for Legged Robot Terrain-adaptive Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00939v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL), driven by data-driven methods, has become an effective solution for robot leg motion control problems. However, the mainstream RL methods for bipedal robot terrain traversal, such as teacher-student policy knowledge distillation, suffer from long training times, which limit development efficiency. To address this issue, this paper proposes BarlowWalk, an improved Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) method integrated with self-supervised representation learning. This method employs the Barlow Twins algorithm to construct a decoupled latent space, mapping historical observation sequences into low-dimensional representations and implementing self-supervision. Meanwhile, the actor requires only proprioceptive information to achieve self-supervised learning over continuous time steps, significantly reducing the dependence on external terrain perception. Simulation experiments demonstrate that this method has significant advantages in complex terrain scenarios. To enhance the credibility of the evaluation, this study compares BarlowWalk with advanced algorithms through comparative tests, and the experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Allocation for Omnidirectional Aerial Robots: Incorporating Power Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16107v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tilt-rotor aerial robots are more dynamic and versatile than fixed-rotor platforms, since the thrust vector and body orientation are decoupled. However, the coordination of servos and propellers (the allocation problem) is not trivial, especially accounting for overactuation and actuator dynamics. We incrementally build and present three novel allocation methods for tiltrotor aerial robots, comparing them to state-of-the-art methods on a real system performing dynamic maneuvers. We extend the state-of-the-art geometric allocation into a differential allocation, which uses the platform's redundancy and does not suffer from singularities. We expand it by incorporating actuator dynamics and propeller power dynamics. These allow us to model dynamic propeller acceleration limits, bringing two main advantages: balancing propeller speed without the need of nullspace goals and allowing the platform to selectively turn-off propellers during flight, opening the door to new manipulation possibilities. We also use actuator dynamics and limits to normalize the allocation problem, making it easier to tune and allowing it to track 70% faster trajectories than a geometric allocation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting Local Observations for Robust Robot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14792v4)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While many robotic tasks can be addressed using either centralized single-agent control with full state observation or decentralized multi-agent control, clear criteria for choosing between these approaches remain underexplored. This paper systematically investigates how multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with local observations can improve robustness in complex robotic systems compared to traditional centralized control. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that in certain tasks, decentralized MARL can achieve performance comparable to centralized methods while exhibiting greater resilience to perturbations and agent failures. By analytically demonstrating the equivalence of single-agent reinforcement learning (SARL) and MARL under full observability, we identify observability as the critical factor distinguishing the two paradigms. We further derive bounds quantifying performance degradation under external perturbations for locally observable policies. Empirical results on standard MARL benchmarks confirm that MARL with limited observations can maintain competitive performance. Finally, real-world experiments with a mobile manipulator demonstrate that decentralized MARL controllers achieve markedly improved robustness to agent malfunctions and environmental disturbances relative to centralized baselines. Together, these findings highlight MARL with local observations as a robust and practical alternative to conventional centralized control in complex robotic systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Estimating Scene Flow in Robot Surroundings with Distributed Miniaturized Time-of-Flight Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02439v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking motions of humans or objects in the surroundings of the robot is essential to improve safe robot motions and reactions. In this work, we present an approach for scene flow estimation from low-density and noisy point clouds acquired from miniaturized Time of Flight (ToF) sensors distributed on the robot body. The proposed method clusters points from consecutive frames and applies Iterative Closest Point (ICP) to estimate a dense motion flow, with additional steps introduced to mitigate the impact of sensor noise and low-density data points. Specifically, we employ a fitness-based classification to distinguish between stationary and moving points and an inlier removal strategy to refine geometric correspondences. The proposed approach is validated in an experimental setup where 24 ToF are used to estimate the velocity of an object moving at different controlled speeds. Experimental results show that the method consistently approximates the direction of the motion and its magnitude with an error which is in line with sensor noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, 1 algorithm, IEEE RO-MAN 2025 accepted paper</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Waypoint Path Planning and Motion Control for Non-holonomic Mobile Robots in Agricultural Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23350v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing demand for autonomous mobile robots capable of navigating unstructured agricultural environments. Tasks such as weed control in meadows require efficient path planning through an unordered set of coordinates while minimizing travel distance and adhering to curvature constraints to prevent soil damage and protect vegetation. This paper presents an integrated navigation framework combining a global path planner based on the Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem (DTSP) with a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategy for local path planning and control. The DTSP generates a minimum-length, curvature-constrained path that efficiently visits all targets, while the NMPC leverages this path to compute control signals to accurately reach each waypoint. The system's performance was validated through comparative simulation analysis on real-world field datasets, demonstrating that the coupled DTSP-based planner produced smoother and shorter paths, with a reduction of about 16% in the provided scenario, compared to decoupled methods. Based thereon, the NMPC controller effectively steered the robot to the desired waypoints, while locally optimizing the trajectory and ensuring adherence to constraints. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework for efficient autonomous navigation in agricultural environments.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[SDHN: Skewness-Driven Hypergraph Networks for Enhanced Localized Multi-Robot Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06684v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning is widely used for multi-robot coordination, where simple graphs typically model pairwise interactions. However, such representations fail to capture higher-order collaborations, limiting effectiveness in complex tasks. While hypergraph-based approaches enhance cooperation, existing methods often generate arbitrary hypergraph structures and lack adaptability to environmental uncertainties. To address these challenges, we propose the Skewness-Driven Hypergraph Network (SDHN), which employs stochastic Bernoulli hyperedges to explicitly model higher-order multi-robot interactions. By introducing a skewness loss, SDHN promotes an efficient structure with Small-Hyperedge Dominant Hypergraph, allowing robots to prioritize localized synchronization while still adhering to the overall information, similar to human coordination. Extensive experiments on Moving Agents in Formation and Robotic Warehouse tasks validate SDHN's effectiveness, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulation-based planning of Motion Sequences for Automated Procedure Optimization in Multi-Robot Assembly Cells](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23270v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconfigurable multi-robot cells offer a promising approach to meet fluctuating assembly demands. However, the recurrent planning of their configurations introduces new challenges, particularly in generating optimized, coordinated multi-robot motion sequences that minimize the assembly duration. This work presents a simulation-based method for generating such optimized sequences. The approach separates assembly steps into task-related core operations and connecting traverse operations. While core operations are constrained and predetermined, traverse operations offer substantial optimization potential. Scheduling the core operations is formulated as an optimization problem, requiring feasible traverse operations to be integrated using a decomposition-based motion planning strategy. Several solution techniques are explored, including a sampling heuristic, tree-based search and gradient-free optimization. For motion planning, a decomposition method is proposed that identifies specific areas in the schedule, which can be solved independently with modified centralized path planning algorithms. The proposed method generates efficient and collision-free multi-robot assembly procedures that outperform a baseline relying on decentralized, robot-individual motion planning. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[KineDepth: Utilizing Robot Kinematics for Online Metric Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19490v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth perception is essential for a robot's spatial and geometric understanding of its environment, with many tasks traditionally relying on hardware-based depth sensors like RGB-D or stereo cameras. However, these sensors face practical limitations, including issues with transparent and reflective objects, high costs, calibration complexity, spatial and energy constraints, and increased failure rates in compound systems. While monocular depth estimation methods offer a cost-effective and simpler alternative, their adoption in robotics is limited due to their output of relative rather than metric depth, which is crucial for robotics applications. In this paper, we propose a method that utilizes a single calibrated camera, enabling the robot to act as a "measuring stick" to convert relative depth estimates into metric depth in real-time as tasks are performed. Our approach employs an LSTM-based metric depth regressor, trained online and refined through probabilistic filtering, to accurately restore the metric depth across the monocular depth map, particularly in areas proximal to the robot's motion. Experiments with real robots demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art monocular metric depth estimation techniques, achieving a 22.1% reduction in depth error and a 52% increase in success rate for a downstream task.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Humanoid robots have the potential to alleviate these pressures by leveraging their human-like dexterity and adaptability to assist in medical procedures. This work conducted an exploratory study on the feasibility of humanoid robots performing direct clinical tasks through teleoperation. A bimanual teleoperation system was developed for the Unitree G1 Humanoid Robot, integrating high-fidelity pose tracking, custom grasping configurations, and an impedance controller to safely and precisely manipulate medical tools. The system is evaluated in seven diverse medical procedures, including physical examinations, emergency interventions, and precision needle tasks. Our results demonstrate that humanoid robots can successfully replicate critical aspects of human medical assessments and interventions, with promising quantitative performance in ventilation and ultrasound-guided tasks. However, challenges remain, including limitations in force output for procedures requiring high strength and sensor sensitivity issues affecting clinical accuracy. This study highlights the potential and current limitations of humanoid robots in hospital settings and lays the groundwork for future research on robotic healthcare integration.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[UniLegs: Universal Multi-Legged Robot Control through Morphology-Agnostic Policy Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22653v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing controllers that generalize across diverse robot morphologies remains a significant challenge in legged locomotion. Traditional approaches either create specialized controllers for each morphology or compromise performance for generality. This paper introduces a two-stage teacher-student framework that bridges this gap through policy distillation. First, we train specialized teacher policies optimized for individual morphologies, capturing the unique optimal control strategies for each robot design. Then, we distill this specialized expertise into a single Transformer-based student policy capable of controlling robots with varying leg configurations. Our experiments across five distinct legged morphologies demonstrate that our approach preserves morphology-specific optimal behaviors, with the Transformer architecture achieving 94.47% of teacher performance on training morphologies and 72.64% on unseen robot designs. Comparative analysis reveals that Transformer-based architectures consistently outperform MLP baselines by leveraging attention mechanisms to effectively model joint relationships across different kinematic structures. We validate our approach through successful deployment on a physical quadruped robot, demonstrating the practical viability of our morphology-agnostic control framework. This work presents a scalable solution for developing universal legged robot controllers that maintain near-optimal performance while generalizing across diverse morphologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Model-Free and Real-Time Unicycle-Based Source Seeking with Differential Wheeled Robotic Experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02184v4)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many autonomous robots aimed at source-seeking are studied, and their controls designed, using unicycle modeling and formulation. This is true not only for model-based controllers, but also for model-free, real-time control methods such as extremum seeking control (ESC). In this paper, we propose a unicycle-based ESC design applicable to differential wheeled robots that: (1) is very simple design, based on one simple control-affine law, and without state integrators; (2) attenuates oscillations known to persist in ESC designs (i.e., fully stop at the source); and (3) operates in a model-free, real-time setting, tolerating environmental/sensor noise. We provide simulation and real-world robotic experimental results for fixed and moving light source seeking by a differential wheeled robot using our proposed design. Results indicate clear advantages of our proposed design when compared to the literature, including attenuation of undesired oscillations, improved convergence speed, and better handling of noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controlling diverse robots by inferring Jacobian fields with deep networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08722v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mirroring the complex structures and diverse functions of natural organisms is a long-standing challenge in robotics. Modern fabrication techniques have greatly expanded the feasible hardware, but using these systems requires control software to translate the desired motions into actuator commands. Conventional robots can easily be modeled as rigid links connected by joints, but it remains an open challenge to model and control biologically inspired robots that are often soft or made of several materials, lack sensing capabilities, and may change their material properties with use. Here, we introduce a method that uses deep neural networks to map a video stream of a robot to its visuomotor Jacobian field (the sensitivity of all 3D points to the robot's actuators). Our method enables the control of robots from only a single camera, makes no assumptions about the robots' materials, actuation, or sensing, and is trained without expert intervention by observing the execution of random commands. We demonstrate our method on a diverse set of robot manipulators that vary in actuation, materials, fabrication, and cost. Our approach achieves accurate closed-loop control and recovers the causal dynamic structure of each robot. Because it enables robot control using a generic camera as the only sensor, we anticipate that our work will broaden the design space of robotic systems and serve as a starting point for lowering the barrier to robotic automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sizhe-li.github.io/publication/neural_jacobian_field</p></details> |
| **[In-between Motion Generation Based Multi-Style Quadruped Robot Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23053v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quadruped robots face persistent challenges in achieving versatile locomotion due to limitations in reference motion data diversity. To address these challenges, this approach introduces an in-between motion generation based multi-style quadruped robot locomotion framework, integrating synergistic advances in motion generation and imitation learning. Our approach establishes a unified pipeline addressing two fundamental aspects: First, we propose a CVAE based motion generator, synthesizing multi-style dynamically feasible locomotion sequences between arbitrary start and end states. By embedding physical constraints and leveraging joint poses based phase manifold continuity, this component produces physically plausible motions spanning multiple gait modalities while ensuring kinematic compatibility with robotic morphologies. Second, we adopt the adversarial motion priors algorithm. We validate the effectiveness of generated motion data in enhancing controller stability and improving velocity tracking performance. The proposed framework demonstrates significant improvements in velocity tracking and deployment stability. We successfully deploy the framework on a real-world quadruped robot, and the experimental validation confirms the framework's capability to generate and execute complex motion profiles, including gallop, tripod, trotting and pacing.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Certifably Correct Algorithm for Generalized Robot-World and Hand-Eye Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23045v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic extrinsic sensor calibration is a fundamental problem for multi-sensor platforms. Reliable and general-purpose solutions should be computationally efficient, require few assumptions about the structure of the sensing environment, and demand little effort from human operators. Since the engineering effort required to obtain accurate calibration parameters increases with the number of sensors deployed, robotics researchers have pursued methods requiring few assumptions about the sensing environment and minimal effort from human operators. In this work, we introduce a fast and certifiably globally optimal algorithm for solving a generalized formulation of the $\textit{robot-world and hand-eye calibration}$ (RWHEC) problem. The formulation of RWHEC presented is "generalized" in that it supports the simultaneous estimation of multiple sensor and target poses, and permits the use of monocular cameras that, alone, are unable to measure the scale of their environments. In addition to demonstrating our method's superior performance over existing solutions, we derive novel identifiability criteria and establish $\textit{a priori}$ guarantees of global optimality for problem instances with bounded measurement errors. We also introduce a complementary Lie-algebraic local solver for RWHEC and compare its performance with our global method and prior art. Finally, we provide a free and open-source implementation of our algorithms and experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures, submitted to the International Journal of Robotics Research</p></details> |
