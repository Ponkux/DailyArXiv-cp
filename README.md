While existing methods have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication to encourage future research.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the emergence of Multi-modal Large Models (MLMs) and World Models (WMs) have attracted significant attention due to their remarkable perception, interaction, and reasoning capabilities, making them a promising architecture for embodied agents. In this survey, we give a comprehensive exploration of the latest advancements in Embodied AI. Our analysis firstly navigates through the forefront of representative works of embodied robots and simulators, to fully understand the research focuses and their limitations. Then, we analyze four main research targets: 1) embodied perception, 2) embodied interaction, 3) embodied agent, and 4) sim-to-real adaptation, covering state-of-the-art methods, essential paradigms, and comprehensive datasets. Additionally, we explore the complexities of MLMs in virtual and real embodied agents, highlighting their significance in facilitating interactions in digital and physical environments. Finally, we summarize the challenges and limitations of embodied AI and discuss potential future directions. We hope this survey will serve as a foundational reference for the research community.

| **[BoxFusion: Reconstruction-Free Open-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection via Real-Time Multi-View Box Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15610v3)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lanlan96.github.io/BoxFusion/</p></details> |
| **[FetchBot: Learning Generalizable Object Fetching in Cluttered Scenes via Zero-Shot Sim2Real](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17894v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizable object fetching in cluttered scenes remains a fundamental and application-critical challenge in embodied AI. Closely packed objects cause inevitable occlusions, making safe action generation particularly difficult. Under such partial observability, effective policies must not only generalize across diverse objects and layouts but also reason about occlusion to avoid collisions. However, collecting large-scale real-world data for this task remains prohibitively expensive, leaving this problem largely unsolved. In this paper, we introduce FetchBot, a sim-to-real framework for this challenge. We first curate a large-scale synthetic dataset featuring 1M diverse scenes and 500k representative demonstrations. Based on this dataset, FetchBot employs a depth-conditioned method for action generation, which leverages structural cues to enable robust obstacle-aware action planning. However, depth is perfect in simulation but noisy in real-world environments. To address this sim-to-real gap, FetchBot predicts depth from RGB inputs using a foundation model and integrates local occupancy prediction as a pre-training task, providing a generalizable latent representation for sim-to-real transfer. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the strong zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, effective clutter handling, and adaptability to novel scenarios. In cluttered environments, it achieves an average real-world success rate of 89.95%, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, FetchBot demonstrates excellent robustness in challenging cases, such as fetching transparent, reflective, and irregular objects, highlighting its practical value.</p></details> | <details><summary>9th A...</summary><p>9th Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025, Oral)</p></details> |
| **[SceneGen: Single-Image 3D Scene Generation in One Feedforward Pass](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15769v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture. Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval; (ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of 3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass; (iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation, potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code and model will be publicly available at: https://mengmouxu.github.io/SceneGen.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report; Project Page: https://mengmouxu.github.io/SceneGen</p></details> |
| **[Mind and Motion Aligned: A Joint Evaluation IsaacSim Benchmark for Task Planning and Low-Level Policies in Mobile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15663v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI. However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution, and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands. This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500 complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot. We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Survey of Vision-Language-Action Models for Embodied Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15201v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied intelligence systems, which enhance agent capabilities through continuous environment interactions, have garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. Vision-Language-Action models, inspired by advancements in large foundation models, serve as universal robotic control frameworks that substantially improve agent-environment interaction capabilities in embodied intelligence systems. This expansion has broadened application scenarios for embodied AI robots. This survey comprehensively reviews VLA models for embodied manipulation. Firstly, it chronicles the developmental trajectory of VLA architectures. Subsequently, we conduct a detailed analysis of current research across 5 critical dimensions: VLA model structures, training datasets, pre-training methods, post-training methods, and model evaluation. Finally, we synthesize key challenges in VLA development and real-world deployment, while outlining promising future research directions.</p></details> | in Chinese language |
| **[Open-Universe Assistance Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15119v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting, we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by both LLM-based and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages + 2 pages references + 7 pages appendix</p></details> |
| **[JRDB-Reasoning: A Difficulty-Graded Benchmark for Visual Reasoning in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10287v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity, offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of visual-language models across reasoning levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied-R1: Reinforced Embodied Reasoning for General Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13998v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalization in embodied AI is hindered by the "seeing-to-doing gap," which stems from data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity. To address this, we pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm, offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action gap in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Embod...</summary><p>Embodied-R1 technical report</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Data Storage and Retrieval for Embodied AI: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13901v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI (EAI) agents continuously interact with the physical world, generating vast, heterogeneous multimodal data streams that traditional management systems are ill-equipped to handle. In this survey, we first systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases, Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than 180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust, high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation of autonomous embodied systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528v5)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p></details> | CoRL 2025 |

However, standardized benchmarks for evaluating robotic athletic performance in real-world settings and in direct comparison to humans remain scarce. We present Switch4EAI(Switch-for-Embodied-AI), a low-cost and easily deployable pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games to evaluate whole-body robot control policies. Using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch as a representative example, our system captures, reconstructs, and retargets in-game choreography for robotic execution. We validate the system on a Unitree G1 humanoid with an open-source whole-body controller, establishing a quantitative baseline for the robot's performance against a human player. In the paper, we discuss these results, which demonstrate the feasibility of using commercial games platform as physically grounded benchmarks and motivate future work to for benchmarking embodied AI.</p></details> | Workshop Submission |
| **[Virtuous Machines: Towards Artificial General Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13421v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness, executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments, accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored. It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and the attribution of scientific credit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large VLM-based Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13073v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation, a key frontier in robotics and embodied AI, requires precise motor control and multimodal understanding, yet traditional rule-based methods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured, novel environments. In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation. We provide a regularly updated project page to document ongoing progress: https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/Large-VLM-based-VLA-for-Robotic-Manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/Large-VLM-based-VLA-for-Robotic-Manipulation</p></details> |
| **[Embodied Image Quality Assessment for Robotic Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18774v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Quality Assessment (IQA) of User-Generated Content (UGC) is a critical technique for human Quality of Experience (QoE). However, does the the image quality of Robot-Generated Content (RGC) demonstrate traits consistent with the Moravec paradox, potentially conflicting with human perceptual norms? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the perception mechanism of embodied robots for image quality. We propose the first Embodied Preference Database (EPD), which contains 12,500 distorted image annotations. We establish assessment metrics based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, there is a gap between UGC and RGC. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-scale Attention Embodied Image Quality Assessment called MA-EIQA. For the proposed EPD dataset, this is the first no-reference IQA model designed for embodied robot. Finally, the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Jianbo-maker/EPD_benchmark.</p></details> |  |

FormCoach transforms a simple camera into an always-on, interactive AI training partner, capable of spotting subtle form errors and delivering tailored corrections in real time, leveraging vision-language models (VLMs). We showcase this capability through a web interface and benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs on a dataset of 1,700 expert-annotated user-reference video pairs spanning 22 strength and mobility exercises. To accelerate research in AI-driven coaching, we release both the dataset and an automated, rubric-based evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized comparison across models. Our benchmarks reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level coaching, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in integrating nuanced, context-aware movement analysis into interactive AI systems. By framing form correction as a collaborative and creative process between humans and machines, FormCoach opens a new frontier in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Affordance-Aware Robotic Dexterous Grasping with Human-like Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08896v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A dexterous hand capable of generalizable grasping objects is fundamental for the development of general-purpose embodied AI. However, previous methods focus narrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordance-aware positioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, a novel framework with two-stage training that learns a universal grasping policy with an inherent understanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage, a trajectory imitator is pre-trained on a large corpus of human hand motions to instill a strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, a residual module is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object instances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative Affordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally inappropriate contact regions, and a privileged teacher-student distillation process that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal dexterous grasping but also remains remarkably human-like in posture and functionally appropriate in contact location. As a result, AffordDex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seen objects, unseen instances, and even entirely novel categories.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Large Model Empowered Embodied AI: A Survey on Decision-Making and Embodied Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10399v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI aims to develop intelligent systems with physical forms capable of perceiving, decision-making, acting, and learning in real-world environments, providing a promising way to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite decades of explorations, it remains challenging for embodied agents to achieve human-level intelligence for general-purpose tasks in open dynamic environments. Recent breakthroughs in large models have revolutionized embodied AI by enhancing perception, interaction, planning and learning. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on large model empowered embodied AI, focusing on autonomous decision-making and embodied learning. We investigate both hierarchical and end-to-end decision-making paradigms, detailing how large models enhance high-level planning, low-level execution, and feedback for hierarchical decision-making, and how large models enhance Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end decision making. For embodied learning, we introduce mainstream learning methodologies, elaborating on how large models enhance imitation learning and reinforcement learning in-depth. For the first time, we integrate world models into the survey of embodied AI, presenting their design methods and critical roles in enhancing decision-making and learning. Though solid advances have been achieved, challenges still exist, which are discussed at the end of this survey, potentially as the further research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoSE: Skill-by-Skill Mixture-of-Experts Learning for Embodied Autonomous Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07818v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To meet the growing demand for smarter, faster, and more efficient embodied AI solutions, we introduce a novel Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) method that significantly boosts reasoning and learning efficiency for embodied autonomous systems. General MoE models demand extensive training data and complex optimization, which limits their applicability in embodied AI such as autonomous driving (AD) and robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose a skill-oriented MoE called MoSE, which mimics the human learning and reasoning process skill-by-skill, step-by-step. We introduce a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the necessary competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks, thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. To better align with multi-step planning in human reasoning and in end-to-end driving models, we build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the model to think step-by-step. Unlike other multi-round dialogues, MoSE integrates valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g. perception-prediction-planning for AD, and high-level and low-level planning for robots) in one single forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model effectively grows more diverse expertise and outperforms models on both AD corner-case reasoning tasks and robot reasoning tasks with less than 40% of the parameters.</p></details> |  |

We also provide a rich variety of playable entities, including humans, animals, robots, and vehicles for embodied AI research. We extend UnrealCV with optimized APIs and tools for data collection, environment augmentation, distributed training, and benchmarking. These improvements achieve significant improvements in the efficiency of rendering and communication, enabling advanced applications such as multi-agent interactions. Our experimental evaluation across visual navigation and tracking tasks reveals two key insights: 1) environmental diversity provides substantial benefits for developing generalizable reinforcement learning (RL) agents, and 2) current embodied agents face persistent challenges in open-world scenarios, including navigation in unstructured terrain, adaptation to unseen morphologies, and managing latency in the close-loop control systems for interacting in highly dynamic objects. UnrealZoo thus serves as both a comprehensive testing ground and a pathway toward developing more capable embodied AI systems for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlight), Project page: http://unrealzoo.site/</p></details> |

Generating synthetic images that closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins, facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using images generated by DiffPhysCam.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 17 figures, and 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[MEReQ: Max-Ent Residual-Q Inverse RL for Sample-Efficient Alignment from Intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16258v3)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning robot behavior with human preferences is crucial for deploying embodied AI agents in human-centered environments. A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |

This task requires the model to identify newly described objects that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view, posing a significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF. Our analysis reveals that 3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key challenges for R3DGS. To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language expressions in a spatially aware paradigm. ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the newly proposed R3DGS task and 3D open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks.

| **[Semantic Mapping in Indoor Embodied AI -- A Survey on Advances, Challenges, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05750v3)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent embodied agents (e.g. robots) need to perform complex semantic tasks in unfamiliar environments. Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

As robotics and automated systems scale, efficient data-sharing frameworks and robust algorithms become critical. We explore the pivotal role of data handling in next-gen networks, focusing on dynamics between application and network providers (AP/NP) in DT ecosystems. We introduce PANAMA, a novel algorithm with Priority Asymmetry for Network Aware Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based multi-agent path finding (MAPF). By adopting a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework and asynchronous actor-learner architectures, PANAMA accelerates training while enabling autonomous task execution by embodied AI. Our approach demonstrates superior pathfinding performance in accuracy, speed, and scalability compared to existing benchmarks. Through simulations, we highlight optimized data-sharing strategies for scalable, automated systems, ensuring resilience in complex, real-world environments. PANAMA bridges the gap between network-aware decision-making and robust multi-agent coordination, advancing the synergy between DTs, wireless networks, and AI-driven automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety of Embodied Navigation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05855v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain influence, the development of embodied AI has accelerated, drawing significant attention, particularly in navigation scenarios. Embodied navigation requires an agent to perceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a specified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied navigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development of safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the findings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety and increasing industrial efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniEAR: Benchmarking Agent Reasoning in Embodied Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05614v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to 56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically (0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zju-real.github.io/OmniEmbodied Code: https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/OmniEmbodied</p></details> |

In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentSense: Virtual Sensor Data Generation Using LLM Agents in Simulated Home Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11773v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge in developing robust and generalizable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems for smart homes is the lack of large and diverse labeled datasets. Variations in home layouts, sensor configurations, and individual behaviors further exacerbate this issue. To address this, we leverage the idea of embodied AI agents-virtual agents that perceive and act within simulated environments guided by internal world models. We introduce AgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline in which agents live out daily routines in simulated smart homes, with behavior guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM generates diverse synthetic personas and realistic routines grounded in the environment, which are then decomposed into fine-grained actions. These actions are executed in an extended version of the VirtualHome simulator, which we augment with virtual ambient sensors that record the agents' activities. Our approach produces rich, privacy-preserving sensor data that reflects real-world diversity. We evaluate AgentSense on five real HAR datasets. Models pretrained on the generated data consistently outperform baselines, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore, combining the generated virtual sensor data with a small amount of real data achieves performance comparable to training on full real-world datasets. These results highlight the potential of using LLM-guided embodied agents for scalable and cost-effective sensor data generation in HAR.</p></details> |  |
| **[IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16402v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems. Code and data are released under [this https URL](https://github.com/AI45Lab/IS-Bench).</p></details> |  |

It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents.

| **[Reconstructing 4D Spatial Intelligence: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21045v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI, which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally, existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes (e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints. We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D spatial intelligence.

| **[Exploring 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Activity Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D task planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advances in multimodal learning. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v4)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Robotic Manipulation Generalization with Minimal Costly Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19516v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied AI intensifies the demand for diverse manipulation demonstrations. However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the RoboTron-Craft, a stage-divided and cost-effective pipeline for realistic manipulation generation. Base on this, the RoboTron-Platter method is introduced, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.

| **[Object Affordance Recognition and Grounding via Multi-scale Cross-modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01184v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification). Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance grounding and classification.</p></details> |  |

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising various rendering engines, a versatile toolchain, and a large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we integrate diverse rendering engines and advanced techniques for environment simulation, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of our environments. Secondly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for aerial VLN data collection, streamlining point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Thirdly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. Moreover, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model emphasizing key observations during flight. For benchmarking, extensive experiments and analyses are conducted, evaluating several recent VLN methods and showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |

We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Exploring the Link Between Bayesian Inference and Embodied Intelligence: Toward Open Physical-World Embodied AI Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21589v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open physical-world embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Robots with soft bodies are examples of such physical systems, and their nonlinear body-environment dynamics can be used to compute and generate the motor signals necessary for the control of their own behavior. In this simulation study, we extend this approach to control and embed not only one but also multiple behaviors into a type of soft robot called a tensegrity robot. The resulting system, consisting of the robot and the environment, is a multistable dynamical system that converges to different attractors from varying initial conditions. Furthermore, attractor analysis reveals that there exist "untrained attractors" in the state space of the system outside the training data. These untrained attractors reflect the intrinsic properties and structures of the tensegrity robot and its interactions with the environment. The impacts of these recent findings in PRC remain unexplored in embodied AI research. We here illustrate their potential to understand various features of embodied cognition that have not been fully addressed to date.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 12 figures.

Despite advances in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$, other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100% of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English, suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable navigation across linguistic contexts.</p></details> |  |

While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive, expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types, combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation) generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive humanoid motion generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://rosielab.github.io/compas3d</p></details> |

As a burgeoning research frontier, 4D generation enables richer interactive and immersive experiences, with applications ranging from digital humans to autonomous driving. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks a unified understanding of 4D representations, generative frameworks, basic paradigms, and the core technical challenges it faces. This survey provides a systematic and in-depth review of the 4D generation landscape. To comprehensively characterize 4D generation, we first categorize fundamental 4D representations and outline associated techniques for 4D generation. We then present an in-depth analysis of representative generative pipelines based on conditions and representation methods. Subsequently, we discuss how motion and geometry priors are integrated into 4D outputs to ensure spatio-temporal consistency under various control schemes. From an application perspective, this paper summarizes 4D generation tasks in areas such as dynamic object/scene generation, digital human synthesis, editable 4D content, and embodied AI. Furthermore, we summarize and multi-dimensionally compare four basic paradigms for 4D generation: End-to-End, Generated-Data-Based, Implicit-Distillation-Based, and Explicit-Supervision-Based.

Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jasper0314-huang.github.io/thinkact-vla/</p></details> |

Due to the rarity of system failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable embodied AI systems. Instead, empirical safety evaluation is employed as an alternative, but the absence of provable guarantees imposes significant limitations. To address these issues, we argue for a paradigm shift to provable probabilistic safety that integrates provable guarantees with progressive achievement toward a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance. The new paradigm better leverages statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability, and a well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be deployed at scale. In this Perspective, we outline a roadmap for provable probabilistic safety, along with corresponding challenges and potential solutions. By bridging the gap between theoretical safety assurance and practical deployment, this Perspective offers a pathway toward safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical applications.</p></details> |  |

Unlike offline video understanding, streaming video understanding requires the ability to process video streams frame by frame, preserve historical information, and make low-latency decisions. To address these challenges, our main contributions are three-fold. (i) We develop a novel streaming video backbone, termed as StreamFormer, by incorporating causal temporal attention into a pre-trained vision transformer. This enables efficient streaming video processing while maintaining image representation capability. (ii) To train StreamFormer, we propose to unify diverse spatial-temporal video understanding tasks within a multitask visual-language alignment framework. Hence, StreamFormer learns global semantics, temporal dynamics, and fine-grained spatial relationships simultaneously. (iii) We conduct extensive experiments on online action detection, online video instance segmentation, and video question answering. StreamFormer achieves competitive results while maintaining efficiency, demonstrating its potential for real-time applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

PR2 offers high-quality scene rendering and robot dynamic simulation, enabling (i) the creation of diverse scenes using various digital assets, (ii) the integration of advanced perception or foundation models, and (iii) the implementation of planning and control algorithms for dynamic humanoid robot behaviors based on environmental feedback. The beta version of PR2 has been deployed for the simulation track of a nationwide full-size humanoid robot competition for college students, attracting 137 teams and over 400 participants within four months. This competition covered traditional tasks in bipedal walking, as well as novel challenges in loco-manipulation and language-instruction-based object search, marking a first for public college robotics competitions. A retrospective analysis of the competition suggests that future events should emphasize the integration of locomotion with manipulation and perception. By making the PR2 testbed publicly available at https://github.com/pr2-humanoid/PR2-Platform, we aim to further advance education and training in humanoid robotics.

As they serve as the primary visual input for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient is therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, but their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video inputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person videos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints inherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a training-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning. EgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR for temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering (PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and removes redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token selector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame diversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune consistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning ratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover, we deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB edge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for on-device egomotion video reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Existing 3D generation primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models, the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we propose \textbf{PhysX-3D}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material, affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models, which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2) Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research in generative physical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://physx-3d.github.io/</p></details> |

Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

As a result, we are seeing similar advancements in embodied AI and robotics for control policy generation. Our review paper examines the integration of generative AI models with RL to advance robotics. Our primary focus is on the duality between generative AI and RL for robotics downstream tasks. Specifically, we investigate: (1) The role of prominent generative AI tools as modular priors for multi-modal input fusion in RL tasks. (2) How RL can train, fine-tune and distill generative models for policy generation, such as VLA models, similarly to RL applications in large language models. We then propose a new taxonomy based on a considerable amount of selected papers. Lastly, we identify open challenges accounting for model scalability, adaptation and grounding, giving recommendations and insights on future research directions. We reflect on which generative AI models best fit the RL tasks and why. On the other side, we reflect on important issues inherent to RL-enhanced generative policies, such as safety concerns and failure modes, and what are the limitations of current methods.

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.

Embodied intelligence focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the physical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only advanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract cognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest. Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the integration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their complementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in intelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and internal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment. By synthesizing current progress and identifying open challenges, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the path toward more capable and generalizable embodied AI systems.

However, most navigation policies are sensitive to viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training method.</p></details> | Under review |

However, expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects, and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training. Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively activates more neuron values in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

While recent vision-language models (VLMs) excel at static perception tasks, they struggle with the temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and commonsense grounding needed for planning in interactive environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that brings R1-style reasoning enhancement into embodied planning. We first distill a high-quality dataset from a powerful closed-source model and perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with structured decision-making priors. We then design a rule-based reward function tailored to multi-step action quality and optimize the policy via Generalized Reinforced Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our approach is evaluated on Embench, a recent benchmark for interactive embodied tasks, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms models of similar or larger scale, including GPT-4o-mini and 70B+ open-source baselines, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen environments. This work highlights the potential of reinforcement-driven reasoning to advance long-horizon planning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Long-term Point Tracking in the Foundation Model Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09217v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However, real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets, offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines. However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time. Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks, demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2501.18487</p></details> |

To tackle these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models.

Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research. Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite. S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic planning.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoramic images, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 48 sequences, both indoors and outdoors.

| **[A Neural Representation Framework with LLM-Driven Spatial Reasoning for Open-Vocabulary 3D Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06719v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical feature field. This field represents language and instance features using distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations, outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their spatial reasoning capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attribution Regularization for Multimodal Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02359v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal machine learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for integrating information from multiple modalities to enhance learning and decision-making processes. However, it is commonly observed that unimodal models outperform multimodal models, despite the latter having access to richer information. Additionally, the influence of a single modality often dominates the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions. The focus of this project lies in the video-audio domain, although the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved. By leveraging this regularization term, the proposed approach aims to mitigate the issue of unimodal dominance and improve the performance of multimodal machine learning systems. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed technique will be assessed. The findings of this research project have the potential to significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal machine learning and facilitate its application in various domains, including multimedia analysis, human-computer interaction, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamArt: Generating Interactable Articulated Objects from a Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05763v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating articulated objects, such as laptops and microwaves, is a crucial yet challenging task with extensive applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR. Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture, neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated asset generation.

With PAPRLE, a user can change the arrangement of the robotic limbs, and control them using a variety of input devices, including puppeteers, gaming controllers, and VR-based interfaces. This versatility supports a wide range of teleoperation scenarios and promotes adaptability to different task requirements. To further enhance configurability, we introduce a pluggable puppeteer device that can be easily mounted and adapted to match the target robot configurations. PAPRLE supports bilateral teleoperation through these puppeteer devices, agnostic to the type or configuration of the follower robot. By supporting both joint-space and task-space control, the system provides real-time force feedback, improving user fidelity and physical interaction awareness. The modular design of PAPRLE facilitates novel spatial arrangements of the limbs and enables scalable data collection, thereby advancing research in embodied AI and learning-based control. We validate PAPRLE in various real-world settings, demonstrating its versatility across diverse combinations of leader devices and follower robots. The system will be released as open source, including both hardware and software components, to support broader adoption and community-driven extension.

Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages with 8 figures and 14 tables; updated for ACL 2025 camera-ready with additional discussion and figures</p></details> |

However, collecting such embodied data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner, a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap. It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74% compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by 89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning.

These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices, and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings, which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents, allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-free Generation of Temporally Consistent Rewards from VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04789v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in embodied tasks such as goal decomposition and visual comprehension. However, providing accurate rewards for robotic manipulation without fine-tuning VLMs remains challenging due to the absence of domain-specific robotic knowledge in pre-trained datasets and high computational costs that hinder real-time applicability. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM, a novel training-free, temporally consistent framework that generates accurate rewards through tracking the status changes in VLM-derived subgoals. Specifically, our method first queries the VLM to establish spatially aware subgoals and an initial completion estimate before each round of interaction. We then employ a Bayesian tracking algorithm to update the goal completion status dynamically, using subgoal hidden states to generate structured rewards for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. This approach enhances long-horizon decision-making and improves failure recovery capabilities with RL. Extensive experiments indicate that $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in two robot manipulation benchmarks, demonstrating superior reward accuracy with reduced computation consumption. We believe our approach not only advances reward generation techniques but also contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://t2-vlm.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimLauncher: Launching Sample-Efficient Real-world Robotic Reinforcement Learning via Simulation Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04452v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous learning of dexterous, long-horizon robotic skills has been a longstanding pursuit of embodied AI. Recent advances in robotic reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable performance and robustness in real-world visuomotor control tasks. However, applying RL in the real world faces challenges such as low sample efficiency, slow exploration, and significant reliance on human intervention. In contrast, simulators offer a safe and efficient environment for extensive exploration and data collection, while the visual sim-to-real gap, often a limiting factor, can be mitigated using real-to-sim techniques. Building on these, we propose SimLauncher, a novel framework that combines the strengths of real-world RL and real-to-sim-to-real approaches to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we first pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment, which then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values using extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived from pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from the pre-trained policy for better exploration. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multi-stage, contact-rich, and dexterous hand manipulation tasks. Compared to prior real-world RL approaches, SimLauncher significantly improves sample efficiency and achieves near-perfect success rates. We hope this work serves as a proof of concept and inspires further research on leveraging large-scale simulation pre-training to benefit real-world robotic RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic 3D Scene Generation with Spatially Contextualized VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20129v3)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints. Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.

While single-arm systems have shown strong task performance, collaborative dual-arm systems are essential for handling more intricate tasks involving rigid, deformable, and tactile-sensitive objects. To advance this goal, we launched the RoboTwin Dual-Arm Collaboration Challenge at the 2nd MEIS Workshop, CVPR 2025. Built on the RoboTwin Simulation platform (1.0 and 2.0) and the AgileX COBOT-Magic Robot platform, the competition consisted of three stages: Simulation Round 1, Simulation Round 2, and a final Real-World Round. Participants totally tackled 17 dual-arm manipulation tasks, covering rigid, deformable, and tactile-based scenarios. The challenge attracted 64 global teams and over 400 participants, producing top-performing solutions like SEM and AnchorDP3 and generating valuable insights into generalizable bimanual policy learning.

Existing techniques generatively re-render the input video to realize the transfer, such as video relighting models and conditioned world generation models. Nevertheless, these models are predominantly limited to the domain of training data (e.g., portrait) or fall into the bottleneck of temporal consistency and computation efficiency, especially when the input video involves complex dynamics and long durations. In this paper, we propose TC-Light, a novel generative renderer to overcome these problems. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark. Extensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible re-rendering results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.

Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose estimation from reward for navigation alone. In a large study we investigate the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking, space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings, leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extend. We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.</p></details> |  |

Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets and algorithms approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered in the research field. In this work, we address this shortcoming by introducing: (1) Articulate3D, an expertly curated 3D dataset featuring high-quality manual annotations on 280 indoor scenes. Articulate3D provides 8 types of annotations for articulated objects, covering parts and detailed motion information, all stored in a standardized scene representation format designed for scalable 3D content creation, exchange and seamless integration into simulation environments. (2) USDNet, a novel unified framework capable of simultaneously predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes for articulated objects. We evaluate USDNet on Articulate3D as well as two existing datasets, demonstrating the advantage of our unified dense prediction approach. Furthermore, we highlight the value of Articulate3D through cross-dataset and cross-domain evaluations and showcase its applicability in downstream tasks such as scene editing through LLM prompting and robotic policy training for articulated object manipulation. We provide open access to our dataset, benchmark, and method's source code.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces CL-Splats, which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused, local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal segmentation and new scene-analysis applications.

Current language model-based navigation systems operate on discrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node connections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams into continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by DeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego dataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling to balance historical and current observations. While large language models can supervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level control. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with expert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced with a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights multi-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong performance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied navigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient, reward-driven post-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: vlnr1.github.io</p></details> |

While early efforts focused on 2D visual perception and simulation, recent 3D-aware generative world models have demonstrated the ability to synthesize geometrically consistent, interactive 3D environments, marking a shift toward 3D spatial cognition. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks systematic analysis to categorize emerging techniques and clarify their roles in advancing 3D cognitive world models. This survey addresses this need by introducing a conceptual framework, providing a structured and forward-looking review of world models transitioning from 2D perception to 3D cognition. Within this framework, we highlight two key technological drivers, particularly advances in 3D representations and the incorporation of world knowledge, as fundamental pillars. Building on these, we dissect three core cognitive capabilities that underpin 3D world modeling: 3D physical scene generation, 3D spatial reasoning, and 3D spatial interaction. We further examine the deployment of these capabilities in real-world applications, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, digital twin, and gaming/VR. Finally, we identify challenges across data, modeling, and deployment, and outline future directions for advancing more robust and generalizable 3D world models.</p></details> |  |

Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion, while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods. A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

The recent rise of AI scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning, and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration, and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven science.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce InternSpatial, the largest open-source dataset for spatial reasoning in VLMs, along with InternSpatial-Bench, a corresponding evaluation benchmark designed to assess spatial understanding under diverse instruction formats. InternSpatial comprises 12 million QA pairs spanning both single-view and multi-view settings, drawn from diverse visual environments and supporting 19 instruction formats that reflect varied query styles. For evaluation, we propose InternSpatial-Bench for single-view tasks and expand multi-view reasoning by introducing a novel rotation angle prediction task that has not been explored in prior work. Experimental results show that models trained on InternSpatial achieve 12.1% improvement on InternSpatial-Bench and 10.7% on VSI-Bench, while maintaining strong performance on general-purpose benchmarks.

However, evaluating their rollouts remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable, semantics-aware evaluator for world models.</p></details> |  |

Through the use of sensors for input and actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges presented by real-world applications.

Although recent advances in simulation platforms have greatly enhanced task diversity to train embodied Vision Language Models (VLMs), most platforms rely on simplified robot morphologies and bypass the stochastic nature of low-level execution, which limits their transferability to real-world robots. To address these issues, we present a physics-based simulation platform DualTHOR for complex dual-arm humanoid robots, built upon an extended version of AI2-THOR. Our simulator includes real-world robot assets, a task suite for dual-arm collaboration, and inverse kinematics solvers for humanoid robots. We also introduce a contingency mechanism that incorporates potential failures through physics-based low-level execution, bridging the gap to real-world scenarios. Our simulator enables a more comprehensive evaluation of the robustness and generalization of VLMs in household environments. Extensive evaluations reveal that current VLMs struggle with dual-arm coordination and exhibit limited robustness in realistic environments with contingencies, highlighting the importance of using our simulator to develop more capable VLMs for embodied tasks.

| **[Efficient and Generalizable Environmental Understanding for Visual Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15377v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality, introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly-supervised VLM-guided Partial Contrastive Learning for Visual Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15757v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Language Navigation (VLN) is a fundamental task within the field of Embodied AI, focusing on the ability of agents to navigate complex environments based on natural language instructions. Despite the progress made by existing methods, these methods often present some common challenges. First, they rely on pre-trained backbone models for visual perception, which struggle with the dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios. Second, the performance is limited when using pre-trained LLMs or VLMs without fine-tuning, due to the absence of VLN domain knowledge. Third, while fine-tuning LLMs and VLMs can improve results, their computational costs are higher than those without fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning (WPCL), a method that enhances an agent's ability to identify objects from dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios by effectively integrating pre-trained VLM knowledge into the perception process, without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Our method enhances the agent's ability to interpret and respond to environmental cues while ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results have shown that our method outperforms the baseline methods on multiple benchmarks, which validate the effectiveness, robustness and generalizability of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[PP-Tac: Paper Picking Using Tactile Feedback in Dexterous Robotic Hands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16649v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots are increasingly envisioned as human companions, assisting with everyday tasks that often involve manipulating deformable objects. Although recent advances in robotic hardware and embodied AI have expanded their capabilities, current systems still struggle with handling thin, flat, and deformable objects such as paper and fabric. This limitation arises from the lack of suitable perception techniques for robust state estimation under diverse object appearances, as well as the absence of planning techniques for generating appropriate grasp motions. To bridge these gaps, this paper introduces PP-Tac, a robotic system for picking up paper-like objects. PP-Tac features a multi-fingered robotic hand with high-resolution omnidirectional tactile sensors \sensorname. This hardware configuration enables real-time slip detection and online frictional force control that mitigates such slips. Furthermore, grasp motion generation is achieved through a trajectory synthesis pipeline, which first constructs a dataset of finger's pinching motions. Based on this dataset, a diffusion-based policy is trained to control the hand-arm robotic system. Experiments demonstrate that PP-Tac can effectively grasp paper-like objects of varying material, thickness, and stiffness, achieving an overall success rate of 87.5\%. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to grasp paper-like deformable objects using a tactile dexterous hand.

The diversity, realism, low cost accessibility and affordability of 3D data assets are critical for achieving generalization and scalability in embodied AI. However, most current embodied intelligence tasks still rely heavily on traditional 3D computer graphics assets manually created and annotated, which suffer from high production costs and limited realism. These limitations significantly hinder the scalability of data driven approaches. We present EmbodiedGen, a foundational platform for interactive 3D world generation. It enables the scalable generation of high-quality, controllable and photorealistic 3D assets with accurate physical properties and real-world scale in the Unified Robotics Description Format (URDF) at low cost. These assets can be directly imported into various physics simulation engines for fine-grained physical control, supporting downstream tasks in training and evaluation. EmbodiedGen is an easy-to-use, full-featured toolkit composed of six key modules: Image-to-3D, Text-to-3D, Texture Generation, Articulated Object Generation, Scene Generation and Layout Generation. EmbodiedGen generates diverse and interactive 3D worlds composed of generative 3D assets, leveraging generative AI to address the challenges of generalization and evaluation to the needs of embodied intelligence related research.

| **[Object-Centric Latent Action Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09680v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging vast amounts of unlabeled internet video data for embodied AI is currently bottlenecked by the lack of action labels and the presence of action-correlated visual distractors. Although recent latent action policy optimization (LAPO) has shown promise in inferring proxy-action labels from visual observations, its performance degrades significantly when distractors are present. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric latent action learning framework that centers on objects rather than pixels. We leverage self-supervised object-centric pretraining to disentangle action-related and distracting dynamics. This allows LAPO to focus on task-relevant interactions, resulting in more robust proxy-action labels, enabling better imitation learning and efficient adaptation of the agent with just a few action-labeled trajectories. We evaluated our method in eight visually complex tasks across the Distracting Control Suite (DCS) and Distracting MetaWorld (DMW). Our results show that object-centric pretraining mitigates the negative effects of distractors by 50%, as measured by downstream task performance: average return (DCS) and success rate (DMW).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Workshop on World Models at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025, Poster, Project Page: https://laom.dunnolab.ai/, Source code: https://github.com/dunnolab/laom</p></details> |
| **[A Navigation Framework Utilizing Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10172v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[OctoNav: Towards Generalist Embodied Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09839v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents, which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1. Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1, we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e., Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically, we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability. Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Analytic Task Scheduler: Recursive Least Squares Based Method for Continual Learning in Embodied Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09623v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied foundation models are crucial for Artificial Intelligence (AI) interacting with the physical world by integrating multi-modal inputs, such as proprioception, vision and language, to understand human intentions and generate actions to control robots. While these models demonstrate strong generalization and few-shot learning capabilities, they face significant challenges in continually acquiring new skills without forgetting previously learned skills, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose the Analytic Task Scheduler (ATS), a novel framework for continual learning in embodied foundation models. ATS consists of a task-specific model library, where each model is fine-tuned independently on a single task, and an analytic scheduler trained using recursive least squares (RLS) to learn the mapping between language instructions and task-specific models. This architecture enables accurate task recognition and dynamic model selection while fundamentally avoiding parameter interference across tasks. The scheduler updates its parameters incrementally using only statistics (autocorrelation and cross-correlation matrices), enabling forgetting-resistant learning without the need to revisit historical data. We validate ATS on a real-world robot platform (RM65B), demonstrating superior resistance to forgetting and strong adaptability to task variations. The results highlight ATS as an effective, scalable, and deployable solution for continual learning in embodied foundation models operating in complex, dynamic environments. Our code will be available at https://github.com/MIAA-Embodied-AI/AnalyticTaskScheduler</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches suffer from a trade-off: generalist agents excel at planning but perform poorly in execution, while specialized agents demonstrate the opposite weakness. Recent compositional frameworks attempt to bridge this gap by combining a planner and an actor, but they are typically static and non-trainable, which prevents adaptation from experience. This is a critical limitation given the scarcity of high-quality data in scientific domains. To address these limitations, we introduce CODA, a novel and trainable compositional framework that integrates a generalist planner (Cerebrum) with a specialist executor (Cerebellum), trained via a dedicated two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, Specialization, we apply a decoupled GRPO approach to train an expert planner for each scientific application individually, bootstrapping from a small set of task trajectories. In the second stage, Generalization, we aggregate all successful trajectories from the specialized experts to build a consolidated dataset, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning of the final planner. This equips CODA with both robust execution and cross-domain generalization. Evaluated on four challenging applications from the ScienceBoard benchmark, CODA significantly outperforms baselines and establishes a new state of the art among open-source models.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code available at this url: https://github.com/OpenIXCLab/CODA</p></details> |

However, translating natural language instructions into effective robotic control policies remains a significant challenge, especially for tasks requiring long-horizon planning and operating under sparse reward conditions. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) provides a natural framework to address this challenge in robotics; however, it typically suffers from non-stationarity caused by the changing behavior of the lower-level policy during training, destabilizing higher-level policy learning. We introduce LGR2, a novel HRL framework that leverages LLMs to generate language-guided reward functions for the higher-level policy. By decoupling high-level reward generation from low-level policy changes, LGR2 fundamentally mitigates the non-stationarity problem in off-policy HRL, enabling stable and efficient learning. To further enhance sample efficiency in sparse environments, we integrate goal-conditioned hindsight experience relabeling. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world robotic navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate LGR2 outperforms both hierarchical and non-hierarchical baselines, achieving over 55% success rates on challenging tasks and robust transfer to real robots, without additional fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, translating multi-source human hand motions into feasible robot behaviors remains challenging, particularly for robots equipped with multi-fingered dexterous hands characterized by complex, high-dimensional action spaces. Moreover, existing approaches often struggle to produce policies capable of adapting to diverse environmental conditions. In this paper, we introduce HERMES, a human-to-robot learning framework for mobile bimanual dexterous manipulation. First, HERMES formulates a unified reinforcement learning approach capable of seamlessly transforming heterogeneous human hand motions from multiple sources into physically plausible robotic behaviors. Subsequently, to mitigate the sim2real gap, we devise an end-to-end, depth image-based sim2real transfer method for improved generalization to real-world scenarios. Furthermore, to enable autonomous operation in varied and unstructured environments, we augment the navigation foundation model with a closed-loop Perspective-n-Point (PnP) localization mechanism, ensuring precise alignment of visual goals and effectively bridging autonomous navigation and dexterous manipulation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HERMES consistently exhibits generalizable behaviors across diverse, in-the-wild scenarios, successfully performing numerous complex mobile bimanual dexterous manipulation tasks.

| **[StepWiser: Stepwise Generative Judges for Wiser Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19229v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e., meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict. Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.</p></details> |  |

This paper analyzes FDS's properties, showing that minimizing the size of its search tree guided by ranked branching decisions is closely related to the Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. Building on this insight, MAB reinforcement learning algorithms are applied to FDS, extended with problem-specific refinements and parameter tuning, and evaluated on the two most fundamental scheduling problems, the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) and Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP). The resulting enhanced FDS, using the best extended MAB algorithm and configuration, performs 1.7 times faster on the JSSP and 2.1 times faster on the RCPSP benchmarks compared to the original implementation in a new solver called OptalCP, while also being 3.5 times faster on the JSSP and 2.1 times faster on the RCPSP benchmarks than the current state-of-the-art FDS algorithm in IBM CP Optimizer 22.1. Furthermore, using only a 900-second time limit per instance, the enhanced FDS improved the existing state-of-the-art lower bounds of 78 of 84 JSSP and 226 of 393 RCPSP standard open benchmark instances while also completely closing a few of them.</p></details> |  |

While discrete multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods are broadly adopted due to their scalability, their coarse discretization severely limits trajectory quality. In contrast, continuous optimization-based planners offer higher-quality paths but suffer from the curse of dimensionality, resulting in poor scalability with respect to the number of robots. This paper tackles the limitations of these two approaches by introducing a novel framework that integrates discrete MAPF solvers with constrained generative diffusion models. The resulting framework, called Discrete-Guided Diffusion (DGD), has three key characteristics: (1) it decomposes the original nonconvex MRMP problem into tractable subproblems with convex configuration spaces, (2) it combines discrete MAPF solutions with constrained optimization techniques to guide diffusion models capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies among robots, and (3) it incorporates a lightweight constraint repair mechanism to ensure trajectory feasibility. The proposed method sets a new state-of-the-art performance in large-scale, complex environments, scaling to 100 robots while achieving planning efficiency and high success rates.</p></details> |  |

Yet existing datasets remain insufficient for robust bimanual manipulation due to (1) the lack of scalable task generation methods and (2) oversimplified simulation environments. We present RoboTwin 2.0, a scalable framework for automated, large-scale generation of diverse and realistic data, together with unified evaluation protocols for dual-arm manipulation. At its core is RoboTwin-OD, an object library of 731 instances across 147 categories with semantic and manipulation-relevant annotations. Building on this, we design an expert data synthesis pipeline that leverages multimodal language models (MLLMs) and simulation-in-the-loop refinement to automatically generate task-level execution code. To improve sim-to-real transfer, RoboTwin 2.0 applies structured domain randomization along five axes: clutter, lighting, background, tabletop height, and language, enhancing data diversity and policy robustness. The framework is instantiated across 50 dual-arm tasks and five robot embodiments. Empirically, it yields a 10.9% gain in code generation success rate. For downstream policy learning, a VLA model trained with synthetic data plus only 10 real demonstrations achieves a 367% relative improvement over the 10-demo baseline, while zero-shot models trained solely on synthetic data obtain a 228% gain. These results highlight the effectiveness of RoboTwin 2.0 in strengthening sim-to-real transfer and robustness to environmental variations.

In this work, we introduce Long-VLA, the first end-to-end VLA model specifically designed for long-horizon robotic tasks. Our approach features a novel phase-aware input masking strategy that adaptively segments each subtask into moving and interaction phases, enabling the model to focus on phase-relevant sensory cues and enhancing subtask compatibility. This unified strategy preserves the scalability and data efficiency of VLA training, and our architecture-agnostic module can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLA models. We further propose the L-CALVIN benchmark to systematically evaluate long-horizon manipulation.

Recently decentralized technologies such as smart contract and blockchain are being explored for applications in robotics. However, the limited transaction processing and high maintenance cost hinder the widespread adoption of such approaches. Moreover, blockchain transactions be they on public or private permissioned blockchain are publically readable which further fails to preserve the confidentiality of the robot's data and privacy of the robot. In this work, we propose RoboComm a Decentralized Identity based approach for privacy-preserving interaction between robots. With DID a component of Self-Sovereign Identity; robots can authenticate each other independently without relying on any third-party service. Verifiable Credentials enable private data associated with a robot to be stored within the robot's hardware, unlike existing blockchain based approaches where the data has to be on the blockchain. We improve throughput by allowing message exchange over state channels. Being a blockchain backed solution RoboComm provides a trustworthy system without relying on a single party. Moreover, we implement our proposed approach to demonstrate the feasibility of our solution.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |

We integrate multi-modal sensors, including the newest front-view and 360-degree solid-state LiDARs, 4-dimensional (4D) radar, stereo cameras, odometer, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver, and inertial measurement units (IMU) on an omnidirectional wheeled robot. Accurate timestamps are obtained through both online hardware synchronization and offline calibration for all sensors. The dataset includes ten larger-scale sequences covering diverse UGV operating scenarios, such as outdoor streets, and indoor parking lots, with a total length of about 17060 meters. High-frequency ground truth, with centimeter-level accuracy for position, is derived from post-processing integrated navigation methods using a navigation-grade IMU. The proposed i2Nav-Robot dataset is evaluated by more than ten open-sourced multi-sensor fusion systems, and it has proven to have superior data quality.</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures |

As robots become integrated into daily life, particularly in homes, the ability to anticipate and respond to environmental hazards is crucial for ensuring user safety, trust, and effective human-robot interaction. Our approach models object-level risk and context through a semantic graph-based propagation algorithm. Each object is represented as a node with an associated risk score, and risk propagates asymmetrically from high-risk to low-risk objects based on spatial proximity and accident relationship. This enables the robot to infer potential hazards even when they are not explicitly visible or labeled. Designed for interpretability and lightweight onboard deployment, our method is validated on a dataset with human-annotated risk regions, achieving a binary risk detection accuracy of 75%. The system demonstrates strong alignment with human perception, particularly in scenes involving sharp or unstable objects. These results underline the potential of context-aware risk reasoning to enhance robotic scene understanding and proactive safety behaviors in shared human-robot spaces. This framework could serve as a foundation for future systems that make context-driven safety decisions, provide real-time alerts, or autonomously assist users in avoiding or mitigating hazards within home environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, Accepted for IEEE RO-MAN 2025 Conference</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Human-Aware Task Allocation for Multi-Robot Systems in Shared Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19731v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot systems are increasingly deployed in applications, such as intralogistics or autonomous delivery, where multiple robots collaborate to complete tasks efficiently. One of the key factors enabling their efficient cooperation is Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA). Algorithms solving this problem optimize task distribution among robots to minimize the overall execution time. In shared environments, apart from the relative distance between the robots and the tasks, the execution time is also significantly impacted by the delay caused by navigating around moving people. However, most existing MRTA approaches are dynamics-agnostic, relying on static maps and neglecting human motion patterns, leading to inefficiencies and delays. In this paper, we introduce \acrfull{method name}. This method leverages Maps of Dynamics (MoDs), spatio-temporal queryable models designed to capture historical human movement patterns, to estimate the impact of humans on the task execution time during deployment. \acrshort{method name} utilizes a stochastic cost function that includes MoDs. Experimental results show that integrating MoDs enhances task allocation performance, resulting in reduced mission completion times by up to $26\%$ compared to the dynamics-agnostic method and up to $19\%$ compared to the baseline. This work underscores the importance of considering human dynamics in MRTA within shared environments and presents an efficient framework for deploying multi-robot systems in environments populated by humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages, 4 Figures, Accepted in IROS2025</p></details> |

We provide a detailed time analysis and appropriate scheduling to facilitate a real-time operation. To this end, an extensive analysis is conducted to identify the time-critical routines and their dependence on the number of obstacles. Furthermore, information about the distance to obstacles is used to compute a structure called dynamic expanded bubble of free configuration space, which is then utilized to establish sufficient conditions for a guaranteed safe motion of the robot while satisfying all kinematic constraints. An extensive randomized simulation trial is conducted to compare the proposed algorithm to a competing state-of-the-art method. Finally, an experimental study on a real robot is carried out covering a variety of scenarios including those with human presence. The results show the effectiveness and feasibility of real-time execution of the proposed motion planning algorithm within a typical sensor-based arrangement, using cheap hardware and sequential architecture, without the necessity for GPUs or heavy parallelization.</p></details> |  |

Conventional thruster-powered systems offer agility but suffer from high energy consumption, while fixed-wing designs are efficient but lack hovering and maneuvering capabilities. We present Floaty, a shape-changing robot that overcomes these limitations by passively soaring, harnessing wind energy through intelligent morphological control inspired by birds. Floaty's design is optimized for passive stability, and its control policy is derived from an experimentally learned aerodynamic model, enabling precise attitude and position control without active propulsion. Wind tunnel experiments demonstrate Floaty's ability to hover, maneuver, and reject disturbances in vertical airflows up to 10 m/s. Crucially, Floaty achieves this with a specific power consumption of 10 W/kg, an order of magnitude lower than thruster-powered systems. This introduces a paradigm for energy-efficient aerial robotics, leveraging morphological intelligence and control to operate sustainably in challenging wind conditions.</p></details> |  |

Learning such behaviors directly on physical hardware remains challenging due to safety and data efficiency constraints. Existing methods, including Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC), require manually defined skill spaces and carefully tuned heuristics, limiting real-world applicability. We propose Unsupervised Real-world Skill Acquisition (URSA), an extension of QDAC that enables robots to autonomously discover and master diverse, high-performing skills directly in the real world. We demonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on a Unitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world. Our approach supports both heuristic-driven skill discovery and fully unsupervised settings. We also show that the learned skill repertoire can be reused for downstream tasks such as real-world damage adaptation, where URSA outperforms all baselines in 5 out of 9 simulated and 3 out of 5 real-world damage scenarios. Our results establish a new framework for real-world robot learning that enables continuous skill discovery with limited human intervention, representing a significant step toward more autonomous and adaptable robotic systems.

To address the challenges of autonomous manipulation (particularly kinematic uncertainties from variable motion scaling and variation of the Remote Center of Motion (RCM) point), we propose AutoRing, an imitation learning framework for autonomous intraocular foreign body ring manipulation. Our approach integrates dynamic RCM calibration to resolve coordinate-system inconsistencies caused by intraocular instrument variation and introduces the RCM-ACT architecture, which combines action-chunking transformers with real-time kinematic realignment. Trained solely on stereo visual data and instrument kinematics from expert demonstrations in a biomimetic eye model, AutoRing successfully completes ring grasping and positioning tasks without explicit depth sensing. Experimental validation demonstrates end-to-end autonomy under uncalibrated microscopy conditions. The results provide a viable framework for developing intelligent eye-surgical systems capable of complex intraocular procedures.</p></details> |  |

Achieving this requires estimating crowd movement to avoid congested areas in real-time. Traditional microscopic models struggle to scale in dense crowds due to high computational cost, while existing macroscopic crowd prediction models tend to be either overly simplistic or computationally intensive. In this work, we propose a lightweight, real-time macroscopic crowd prediction model tailored for human motion, which balances prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Our approach simplifies both spatial and temporal processing based on the inherent characteristics of pedestrian flow, enabling robust generalization without the overhead of complex architectures. We demonstrate a 3.6 times reduction in inference time, while improving prediction accuracy by 3.1 %. Integrated into a socially aware planning framework, the model enables efficient and socially compliant robot navigation in dynamic environments. This work highlights that efficient human crowd modeling enables robots to navigate dense environments without costly computations.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, accepted in ECMR 2025</p></details> |

Second, we introduce a three-level whole-body disturbance rejection control framework (T-WB-DRC). Unlike the previous two-level approach, this three-level framework considers both the plan based on whole-body dynamics without uncertainties and the plan based on dynamics with uncertainties, significantly improving payload transportation, external disturbance rejection, and fault tolerance. Third, simulations of both humanoid and quadruped robots in the Gazebo simulator demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of T-WB-DRC.

Recent works leverage pre-trained vision-language models to measure the similarity between encoded visual observations and textual instructions, and then train a model to map this similarity to robot actions. However, this two-step approach limits the model to capture the relationship between visual observations and textual instructions, leading to reduced precision in manipulation tasks. We propose to learn visual-textual associations through a self-supervised pretext task: reconstructing a masked goal image conditioned on an input image and textual instructions. This formulation allows the model to learn visual-action representations without robot action supervision. The learned representations can then be fine-tuned for manipulation tasks with only a few demonstrations. We also introduce the \textit{Omni-Object Pick-and-Place} dataset, which consists of annotated robot tabletop manipulation episodes, including 180 object classes and 3,200 instances with corresponding textual instructions. This dataset enables the model to acquire diverse object priors and allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of its generalisation capability across object instances. Experimental results on the five benchmarks, including both simulated and real-robot validations, demonstrate that our method outperforms prior art.</p></details> |  |

Like the Jacob's Ladder toy, FlipWalker features two interconnected segments joined by flexible cables, enabling it to pivot and flip around singularities in a manner reminiscent of the toy's cascading motion. Actuation is provided by motor-driven legs within each segment that push off either the ground or the opposing segment, depending on the robot's current configuration. A physics-based model of the underactuated flipping dynamics is formulated to elucidate the critical design parameters governing forward motion and obstacle clearance or climbing. The untethered prototype weighs 0.78 kg, achieves a maximum flipping speed of 0.2 body lengths per second. Experimental trials on artificial grass, river rocks, and snow demonstrate that FlipWalker's flipping strategy, which relies on ground reaction forces applied normal to the surface, offers a promising alternative to traditional locomotion for navigating irregular outdoor terrain.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |

Cognitive science suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline.

Dojo models hard contact and friction with a nonlinear complementarity problem with second-order cone constraints. We introduce a custom primal-dual interior-point method to solve the second order cone program for stable forward simulation over a broad range of sample rates. We obtain smooth gradient approximations with this solver through the implicit function theorem, giving gradients that are useful for downstream trajectory optimization, policy optimization, and system identification applications. Specifically, we propose to use the central path parameter threshold in the interior point solver as a user-tunable design parameter. A high value gives a smooth approximation to contact dynamics with smooth gradients for optimization and learning, while a low value gives precise simulation rollouts with hard contact. We demonstrate Dojo's differentiability in trajectory optimization, policy learning, and system identification examples. We also benchmark Dojo against MuJoCo, PyBullet, Drake, and Brax on a variety of robot models, and study the stability and simulation quality over a range of sample frequencies and accuracy tolerances. Finally, we evaluate the sim-to-real gap in hardware experiments with a Ufactory xArm 6 robot. Dojo is an open source project implemented in Julia with Python bindings, with code available at https://github.com/dojo-sim/Dojo.jl.</p></details> |  |

We have developed a small, purpose-built model checking algorithm which generates plans in situ based on "core" knowledge and attention as found in biological agents. This is achieved in real-time using no pre-computed data on a low-powered device. Our approach is based on chaining temporary control systems which are spawned to counteract disturbances in the local environment that disrupt an autonomous agent from its preferred action (or resting state). A novel discretization of 2D LiDAR data sensitive to bounded variations in the local environment is used. Multi-step planning using model checking by forward depth-first search is applied to cul-de-sac and playground scenarios. Both empirical results and informal proofs of two fundamental properties of our approach demonstrate that model checking can be used to create efficient multi-step plans for local obstacle avoidance, improving on the performance of a reactive agent which can only plan one step. Our approach is an instructional case study for the development of safe, reliable and explainable planning in the context of autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages excluding references, 18 figures, submitted to Formal Aspects of Computing</p></details> |

DELIVER unifies natural language understanding, spatial decomposition, relay planning, and motion execution to enable scalable, collision-free coordination in real-world settings. Given a spoken or written instruction, a lightweight instance of LLaMA3 interprets the command to extract pickup and delivery locations. The environment is partitioned using a Voronoi tessellation to define robot-specific operating regions. Robots then compute optimal relay points along shared boundaries and coordinate handoffs. A finite-state machine governs each robot's behavior, enabling robust execution. We implement DELIVER on the MultiTRAIL simulation platform and validate it in both ROS2-based Gazebo simulations and real-world hardware using TurtleBot3 robots. Empirical results show that DELIVER maintains consistent mission cost across varying team sizes while reducing per-agent workload by up to 55% compared to a single-agent system. Moreover, the number of active relay agents remains low even as team size increases, demonstrating the system's scalability and efficient agent utilization. These findings underscore DELIVER's modular and extensible architecture for language-guided multi-robot coordination, advancing the frontiers of cyber-physical system integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission under review at the 2026 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII 2026)</p></details> |

Existing methods primarily focus on LLM training and prompt design that utilize LLMs to generate executable programs directly from user tasks in natural language. However, due to the inconsistency of the LLMs and the high complexity of the tasks, such best-effort approaches often lead to tremendous programming errors in the generated code, which significantly undermines the effectiveness especially when the light-weight LLMs are applied. This paper introduces a natural-robotic language translation framework that (i) provides correctness verification for generated control programs and (ii) enhances the performance of LLMs in program generation via feedback-based fine-tuning for the programs. To achieve this, a Robot Skill Language (RSL) is proposed to abstract away from the intricate details of the control programs, bridging the natural language tasks with the underlying robot skills. Then, the RSL compiler and debugger are constructed to verify RSL programs generated by the LLM and provide error feedback to the LLM for refining the outputs until being verified by the compiler. This provides correctness guarantees for the LLM-generated programs before being offloaded to the robots for execution, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of LLM-powered robotic applications. Experiments demonstrate NRTrans outperforms the existing method under a range of LLMs and tasks, and achieves a high success rate for light-weight LLMs.</p></details> |  |

To support this framework, we construct HPose, a context-enriched dataset featuring fine-grained situational annotations. Furthermore, we introduce a bone scaling-based data augmentation strategy that ensures millimeter-level compatibility across heterogeneous humanoid robots. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple commercial platforms demonstrate that HuBE significantly improves motion similarity, behavioral appropriateness, and computational efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a solid foundation for transferable and human-like behavior execution across diverse humanoid robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures,4 tables</p></details> |

Despite progress in pixel-level Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) control, the requirement of continuous visibility and the existence of complex disturbances, such as parameterization error, measurement noise, and uncertainties of payloads, could degrade the surgeon's visual experience and compromise procedural safety. To address these limitations, this paper proposes VisionSafeEnhanced Visual Predictive Control (VPC), a robust and uncertainty-adaptive framework for autonomous laparoscope control that guarantees Field of View (FoV) safety under uncertainty. Firstly, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is utilized to perform hybrid (deterministic + stochastic) quantification of operational uncertainties including residual model uncertainties, stochastic uncertainties, and external disturbances. Based on uncertainty quantification, a novel safety aware trajectory optimization framework with probabilistic guarantees is proposed, where a uncertainty-adaptive safety Control Barrier Function (CBF) condition is given based on uncertainty propagation, and chance constraints are simultaneously formulated based on probabilistic approximation. This uncertainty aware formulation enables adaptive control effort allocation, minimizing unnecessary camera motion while maintaining robustness. The proposed method is validated through comparative simulations and experiments on a commercial surgical robot platform (MicroPort MedBot Toumai) performing a sequential multi-target lymph node dissection.

Although advances in deep learning have made it increasingly feasible to replicate the dexterity of human teleoperation in robots, generalizing these acquired skills to previously unseen scenarios remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a novel algorithm, Gaze-based Bottleneck-aware Robot Manipulation (GazeBot), which enables high reusability of learned motions without sacrificing dexterity or reactivity. By leveraging gaze information and motion bottlenecks, both crucial features for object manipulation, GazeBot achieves high success rates compared with state-of-the-art imitation learning methods, particularly when the object positions and end-effector poses differ from those in the provided demonstrations. Furthermore, the training process of GazeBot is entirely data-driven once a demonstration dataset with gaze data is provided.

However, EIT-based tactile sensors face significant challenges during surface bending. Deformation alters the baseline impedance distribution and couples with touch-induced conductivity variations, complicating signal interpretation. To address this challenge, we present a novel sensing framework that integrates a deep neural network for interaction state classification with a dynamic adaptive reference strategy to decouple touch and deformation signals, while a data-driven regression model translates EIT voltage changes into continuous bending angles. The framework is validated using a magnetic hydrogel composite sensor that conforms to bendable surfaces. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves precise and robust bending angle estimation, high accuracy in distinguishing touch, bending, and idle states, and significantly improves touch localization quality under bending deformation compared to conventional fixed-reference methods. Real-time experiments confirm the system's capability to reliably detect multi-touch interactions and track bending angles across varying deformation conditions. This work paves the way for flexible EIT-based robotic skins capable of rich multimodal sensing in robotics and human-robot interaction.</p></details> |  |

However, many failure detection methods struggle to provide meaningful performance when applied to a variety of real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a video-based failure detection approach that uses spatio-temporal knowledge in the form of the actions the robot performs and task-relevant objects within the field of view. Both pieces of information are available in most robotic scenarios and can thus be readily obtained. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets that we amend, in part, with additional annotations of the aforementioned task-relevant knowledge. In light of the results, we also propose a data augmentation method that improves performance by applying variable frame rates to different parts of the video. We observe an improvement from 77.9 to 80.0 in F1 score on the ARMBench dataset without additional computational expense and an additional increase to 81.4 with test-time augmentation. The results emphasize the importance of spatio-temporal information during failure detection and suggest further investigation of suitable heuristics in future implementations.

Previous methods primarily focused on single-robot centralized planning strategies, which severely limited exploration efficiency. Recent research has considered decentralized planning strategies for multiple robots, assigning separate planning models to each robot, but these approaches often overlook communication costs. In this work, we propose Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Co-Navigation (MCoCoNav), a modular approach that utilizes multimodal Chain-of-Thought to plan collaborative semantic navigation for multiple robots. MCoCoNav combines visual perception with Vision Language Models (VLMs) to evaluate exploration value through probabilistic scoring, thus reducing time costs and achieving stable outputs. Additionally, a global semantic map is used as a communication bridge, minimizing communication overhead while integrating observational results. Guided by scores that reflect exploration trends, robots utilize this map to assess whether to explore new frontier points or revisit history nodes. Experiments on HM3D_v0.2 and MP3D demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/FrankZxShen/MCoCoNav.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, Extended Version of accepted AAAI 2025 Paper</p></details> |
| **[Physical Autoregressive Model for Robotic Manipulation without Action Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09822v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

Real-world learning, despite being crucial for overcoming the sim-to-real gap, faces substantial challenges related to safety, reward design, and learning efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Robot-Trains-Robot (RTR), a novel framework where a robotic arm teacher actively supports and guides a humanoid robot student. The RTR system provides protection, learning schedule, reward, perturbation, failure detection, and automatic resets. It enables efficient long-term real-world humanoid training with minimal human intervention. Furthermore, we propose a novel RL pipeline that facilitates and stabilizes sim-to-real transfer by optimizing a single dynamics-encoded latent variable in the real world. We validate our method through two challenging real-world humanoid tasks: fine-tuning a walking policy for precise speed tracking and learning a humanoid swing-up task from scratch, illustrating the promising capabilities of real-world humanoid learning realized by RTR-style systems.

| **[Integration of Robot and Scene Kinematics for Sequential Mobile Manipulation Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18627v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a Sequential Mobile Manipulation Planning (SMMP) framework that can solve long-horizon multi-step mobile manipulation tasks with coordinated whole-body motion, even when interacting with articulated objects. By abstracting environmental structures as kinematic models and integrating them with the robot's kinematics, we construct an Augmented Configuration Apace (A-Space) that unifies the previously separate task constraints for navigation and manipulation, while accounting for the joint reachability of the robot base, arm, and manipulated objects. This integration facilitates efficient planning within a tri-level framework: a task planner generates symbolic action sequences to model the evolution of A-Space, an optimization-based motion planner computes continuous trajectories within A-Space to achieve desired configurations for both the robot and scene elements, and an intermediate plan refinement stage selects action goals that ensure long-horizon feasibility. Our simulation studies first confirm that planning in A-Space achieves an 84.6\% higher task success rate compared to baseline methods. Validation on real robotic systems demonstrates fluid mobile manipulation involving (i) seven types of rigid and articulated objects across 17 distinct contexts, and (ii) long-horizon tasks of up to 14 sequential steps. Our results highlight the significance of modeling scene kinematics into planning entities, rather than encoding task-specific constraints, offering a scalable and generalizable approach to complex robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 13 figures; accepted by Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

However, the reliance on large datasets and neural networks presents challenges such as highpower consumption and limited adaptability, particularly in SWaP-constrained applications like planetary exploration. To address these issues, we propose enhancing the autonomous capabilities of intelligent robots by emulating the associative learning observed in animals. Associative learning enables animals to adapt to their environment by memorizing concurrent events. By replicating this mechanism, neuromorphic robots can navigate dynamic environments autonomously, learning from interactions to optimize performance. This paper explores the emulation of associative learning in rodents using neuromorphic robots within open-field maze environments, leveraging insights from spatial cells such as place and grid cells. By integrating these models, we aim to enable online associative learning for spatial tasks in real-time scenarios, bridging the gap between biological spatial cognition and robotics for advancements in autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods of visual affordance predictions often rely on manually annotated data or conditions only on a predefined set of tasks. We introduce UAD (Unsupervised Affordance Distillation), a method for distilling affordance knowledge from foundation models into a task-conditioned affordance model without any manual annotations. By leveraging the complementary strengths of large vision models and vision-language models, UAD automatically annotates a large-scale dataset with detailed $<$instruction, visual affordance$>$ pairs. Training only a lightweight task-conditioned decoder atop frozen features, UAD exhibits notable generalization to in-the-wild robotic scenes and to various human activities, despite only being trained on rendered objects in simulation. Using affordance provided by UAD as the observation space, we show an imitation learning policy that demonstrates promising generalization to unseen object instances, object categories, and even variations in task instructions after training on as few as 10 demonstrations.

A promising and challenging mission is the use of autonomous robot systems to automate tasks in the field of maintenance. For this purpose, the robot system must be able to plan autonomously the different manipulation tasks and the corresponding paths. Basic requirements are the development of algorithms with a low computational complexity and the possibility to deal with environmental uncertainties. In this work, an approach is presented, which is especially suited to solve the problem of maintenance automation. For this purpose, offline data from CAD is combined with online data from an RGBD vision system via a probabilistic filter, to compensate uncertainties from offline data. For planning the different tasks, a method is explained, which use a symbolic description, founded on a novel sampling-based method to compute the disassembly space. For path planning we use global state-of-the art algorithms with a method that allows the adaption of the exploration stepsize in order to reduce the planning time. Every method is experimentally validated and discussed.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

However, existing 3D world models are primarily limited to single-material dynamics using a particle-based Graph Neural Network model, and often require time-consuming 3D scene reconstruction to obtain 3D particle tracks for training. In this work, we present ParticleFormer, a Transformer-based point cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction loss, supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material, multi-object robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained multi-object interactions between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials, trained directly from real-world robot perception data without an elaborate scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness both in 3D scene forecasting tasks, and in downstream manipulation tasks using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy. In addition, we extend existing dynamics learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material, multi-object interaction scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and three real-world experiments, where it consistently outperforms leading baselines by achieving superior dynamics prediction accuracy and less rollout error in downstream visuomotor tasks.

Language driven robotic grasping (LDRG) predicts stable grasp poses from natural language queries and RGB-D images. We propose MapleGrasp, a novel framework that leverages mask-guided feature pooling for efficient vision-language driven grasping. Our two-stage training first predicts segmentation masks from CLIP-based vision-language features. The second stage pools features within these masks to generate pixel-level grasp predictions, improving efficiency, and reducing computation. Incorporating mask pooling results in a 7% improvement over prior approaches on the OCID-VLG benchmark. Furthermore, we introduce RefGraspNet, an open-source dataset eight times larger than existing alternatives, significantly enhancing model generalization for open-vocabulary grasping. MapleGrasp scores a strong grasping accuracy of 89\% when compared with competing methods in the RefGraspNet benchmark. Our method achieves comparable performance to larger Vision-Language-Action models on the LIBERO benchmark, and shows significantly better generalization to unseen tasks. Real-world experiments on a Franka arm demonstrate 73% success rate with unseen objects, surpassing competitive baselines by 11%. Code is provided in our github repository.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often treat consensus in discrete and continuous decision spaces as distinct problems. We present DANCeRS, a unified, distributed algorithm leveraging Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to achieve consensus in both domains. By representing a swarm as a factor graph our method ensures scalability and robustness in dynamic environments, relying on purely peer-to-peer message passing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our general framework through two applications where agents in a swarm must achieve consensus on global behaviour whilst relying on local communication. In the first, robots must perform path planning and collision avoidance to create shape formations. In the second, we show how the same framework can be used by a group of robots to form a consensus over a set of discrete decisions. Experimental results highlight our method's scalability and efficiency compared to recent approaches to these problems making it a promising solution for multi-robot systems requiring distributed consensus.

| **[The Effects of Communication Delay on Human Performance and Neurocognitive Responses in Mobile Robot Teleoperation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18074v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Communication delays in mobile robot teleoperation adversely affect human-machine collaboration. Understanding delay effects on human operational performance and neurocognition is essential for resolving this issue. However, no previous research has explored this. To fill this gap, we conduct a human-in-the-loop experiment involving 10 participants, integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and robot behavior data under varying delays (0-500 ms in 100 ms increments) to systematically investigate these effects. Behavior analysis reveals significant performance degradation at 200-300 ms delays, affecting both task efficiency and accuracy. EEG analysis discovers features with significant delay dependence: frontal $\theta/\beta$-band and parietal $\alpha$-band power. We also identify a threshold window (100-200 ms) for early perception of delay in humans, during which these EEG features first exhibit significant differences. When delay exceeds 400 ms, all features plateau, indicating saturation of cognitive resource allocation at physiological limits. These findings provide the first evidence of perceptual and cognitive delay thresholds during teleoperation tasks in humans, offering critical neurocognitive insights for the design of delay compensation strategies.</p></details> |  |

Locating and Grasping Objects by a Robot Arm Covered with Sensitive Skin](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17986v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locating and grasping of objects by robots is typically performed using visual sensors. Haptic feedback from contacts with the environment is only secondary if present at all. In this work, we explored an extreme case of searching for and grasping objects in complete absence of visual input, relying on haptic feedback only. The main novelty lies in the use of contacts over the complete surface of a robot manipulator covered with sensitive skin. The search is divided into two phases: (1) coarse workspace exploration with the complete robot surface, followed by (2) precise localization using the end-effector equipped with a force/torque sensor. We systematically evaluated this method in simulation and on the real robot, demonstrating that diverse objects can be located, grasped, and put in a basket. The overall success rate on the real robot for one object was 85.7\% with failures mainly while grasping specific objects. The method using whole-body contacts is six times faster compared to a baseline that uses haptic feedback only on the end-effector. We also show locating and grasping multiple objects on the table. This method is not restricted to our specific setup and can be deployed on any platform with the ability of sensing contacts over the entire body surface. This work holds promise for diverse applications in areas with challenging visual perception (due to lighting, dust, smoke, occlusion) such as in agriculture when fruits or vegetables need to be located inside foliage and picked.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for review to ICRA 2026</p></details> |

While recent efforts in robotics have leveraged LLMs both for high-level and low-level planning, these approaches often face significant challenges, such as hallucinations in long-horizon tasks and limited adaptability due to the generation of plans in a single pass without real-time feedback. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-agent LLM framework, Multi-Agent Large Language Model for Manipulation (MALMM) that distributes high-level planning and low-level control code generation across specialized LLM agents, supervised by an additional agent that dynamically manages transitions. By incorporating observations from the environment after each step, our framework effectively handles intermediate failures and enables adaptive re-planning. Unlike existing methods, our approach does not rely on pre-trained skill policies or in-context learning examples and generalizes to a variety of new tasks. We evaluate our approach on nine RLBench tasks, including long-horizon tasks, and demonstrate its ability to solve robotics manipulation in a zero-shot setting, thereby overcoming key limitations of existing LLM-based manipulation methods.</p></details> | 48 pages |

While teleoperation is effective, it depends on costly and inflexible robot platforms. In-the-wild demonstrations offer a promising alternative, but existing collection devices have key limitations: handheld setups offer limited observational coverage, and whole-body systems often require fine-tuning with robot data due to domain gaps. To address these challenges, we present AirExo-2, a low-cost exoskeleton system for large-scale in-the-wild data collection, along with several adaptors that transform collected data into pseudo-robot demonstrations suitable for policy learning. We further introduce RISE-2, a generalizable imitation learning policy that fuses 3D spatial and 2D semantic perception for robust manipulations. Experiments show that RISE-2 outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on both in-domain and generalization evaluations. Trained solely on adapted in-the-wild data produced by AirExo-2, the RISE-2 policy achieves comparable performance to the policy trained with teleoperated data, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of AirExo-2 for scalable and generalizable imitation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to CoRL 2025</p></details> |

This shift is fostering an environment in which anyone can freely develop bipedal robots and share their knowledge, rather than relying solely on commercial products. However, most existing open-source bipedal robots are designed to be fabricated using 3D printers, which limits their scalability in size and often results in fragile structures. On the other hand, some metal-based bipedal robots have been developed, but they typically involve a large number of components, making assembly difficult, and in some cases, the parts themselves are not readily available through e-commerce platforms. To address these issues, we developed MEVITA, an open-source bipedal robot that can be built entirely from components available via e-commerce. Aiming for the minimal viable configuration for a bipedal robot, we utilized sheet metal welding to integrate complex geometries into single parts, thereby significantly reducing the number of components and enabling easy assembly for anyone.

However, despite their advantages, synthetic event-based vision remains largely unexplored in mainstream robotics simulators. This lack of simulation setup hinders the evaluation of event-driven approaches for robotic manipulation and navigation tasks. This work presents an open-source, user-friendly v2e robotics operating system (ROS) package for Gazebo simulation that enables seamless event stream generation from RGB camera feeds. The package is used to investigate event-based robotic policies (ERP) for real-time navigation and manipulation. Two representative scenarios are evaluated: (1) object following with a mobile robot and (2) object detection and grasping with a robotic manipulator. Transformer-based ERPs are trained by behavior cloning and compared to RGB-based counterparts under various operating conditions. Experimental results show that event-guided policies consistently deliver competitive advantages. The results highlight the potential of event-driven perception to improve real-time robotic navigation and manipulation, providing a foundation for broader integration of event cameras into robotic policy learning.

The established image-based world models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model (GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot actions.

GWM can not only enhance the visual representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling potential of 3D world model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICCV 2025.

An analysis of existing robotics benchmarks reveals that successful task performance hinges on three key whole-body control capabilities: bimanual coordination, stable and precise navigation, and extensive end-effector reachability. Achieving these capabilities requires careful hardware design, but the resulting system complexity further complicates visuomotor policy learning. To address these challenges, we introduce the BEHAVIOR Robot Suite (BRS), a comprehensive framework for whole-body manipulation in diverse household tasks. Built on a bimanual, wheeled robot with a 4-DoF torso, BRS integrates a cost-effective whole-body teleoperation interface for data collection and a novel algorithm for learning whole-body visuomotor policies. We evaluate BRS on five challenging household tasks that not only emphasize the three core capabilities but also introduce additional complexities, such as long-range navigation, interaction with articulated and deformable objects, and manipulation in confined spaces.

Equipping these robots with manipulator arms unlocks the advanced capability of loco-manipulation to perform complex physical interaction tasks in areas ranging from industrial automation to search-and-rescue missions. However, achieving precise and adaptable grasping in such dynamic scenarios remains a significant challenge, often hindered by the need for extensive real-world calibration and pre-programmed grasp configurations. This paper introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, focusing on improved precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real methodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a pipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic dataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of interactions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated grasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was used to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes multi-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images, depth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model outputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We validated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system successfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to a target object, perceiving it with its sensors, predicting the optimal grasp pose using our model, and performing a precise grasp. This work proves that leveraging simulated training with advanced sensing offers a scalable and effective solution for object handling.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various robot tasks.

Each agent incorporates a two-layer optimization mechanism, with self-reflection for iterative refinement and human-in-the-loop for better alignment with user preferences. AutoMisty ensures a transparent reasoning process, allowing users to iteratively refine tasks through natural language feedback for precise execution. To evaluate AutoMisty's effectiveness, we designed a benchmark task set spanning four levels of complexity and conducted experiments in a real Misty robot environment. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoMisty not only consistently generates high-quality code but also enables precise code control, significantly outperforming direct reasoning with ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-o1. All code, optimized APIs, and experimental videos will be publicly released through the webpage: https://wangxiaoshawn.github.io/AutoMisty.html</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

To address the notable challenge of data acquisition due to occlusion, a COOL approach based on the Dirichlet process mixture model is proposed to efficiently extract motion distribution information by exchanging among robots selected learning structures. By leveraging the fine-grained local-moment information learned through COOL, a data-stream-driven ambiguity set for obstacle motion is constructed. We then introduce a novel ambiguity set propagation method, which theoretically admits the derivation of the ambiguity sets for obstacle positions over the entire prediction horizon by utilizing obstacle current positions and the ambiguity set for obstacle motion. Additionally, we develop a compression scheme with its safety guarantee to automatically adjust the complexity and granularity of the ambiguity set by aggregating basic ambiguity sets that are close in a measure space, thereby striking an attractive trade-off between control performance and computation time. Then the probabilistic collision-free trajectories are generated through distributionally robust optimization problems. The distributionally robust obstacle avoidance constraints based on the compressed ambiguity set are equivalently reformulated by deriving separating hyperplanes through tractable semi-definite programming. Finally, we establish the probabilistic collision avoidance guarantee and the long-term tracking performance guarantee for the proposed framework. The numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed approach compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphCoT-VLA: A 3D Spatial-Aware Reasoning Vision-Language-Action Model for Robotic Manipulation with Ambiguous Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07650v2)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action models have emerged as a crucial paradigm in robotic manipulation. However, existing VLA models exhibit notable limitations in handling ambiguous language instructions and unknown environmental states. Furthermore, their perception is largely constrained to static two-dimensional observations, lacking the capability to model three-dimensional interactions between the robot and its environment. To address these challenges, this paper proposes GraphCoT-VLA, an efficient end-to-end model. To enhance the model's ability to interpret ambiguous instructions and improve task planning, we design a structured Chain-of-Thought reasoning module that integrates high-level task understanding and planning, failed task feedback, and low-level imaginative reasoning about future object positions and robot actions. Additionally, we construct a real-time updatable 3D Pose-Object graph, which captures the spatial configuration of robot joints and the topological relationships between objects in 3D space, enabling the model to better understand and manipulate their interactions. We further integrates a dropout hybrid reasoning strategy to achieve efficient control outputs. Experimental results across multiple real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that GraphCoT-VLA significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of task success rate and response speed, exhibiting strong generalization and robustness in open environments and under uncertain instructions.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Fiducial Marker Splatting for High-Fidelity Robotics Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17012v1)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-fidelity 3D simulation is critical for training mobile robots, but its traditional reliance on mesh-based representations often struggle in complex environments, such as densely packed greenhouses featuring occlusions and repetitive structures. Recent neural rendering methods, like Gaussian Splatting (GS), achieve remarkable visual realism but lack flexibility to incorporate fiducial markers, which are essential for robotic localization and control. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the photorealism of GS with structured marker representations. Our core contribution is a novel algorithm for efficiently generating GS-based fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTags) within cluttered scenes. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional image-fitting techniques in both efficiency and pose-estimation accuracy. We further demonstrate the framework's potential in a greenhouse simulation. This agricultural setting serves as a challenging testbed, as its combination of dense foliage, similar-looking elements, and occlusions pushes the limits of perception, thereby highlighting the framework's value for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we created a benchmark and organized the ICRA 2024 Cloth Competition, a unique head-to-head evaluation focused on grasp pose selection for in-air robotic cloth unfolding. Eleven diverse teams participated in the competition, utilizing our publicly released dataset of real-world robotic cloth unfolding attempts and a variety of methods to design their unfolding approaches. Afterwards, we also expanded our dataset with 176 competition evaluation trials, resulting in a dataset of 679 unfolding demonstrations across 34 garments. Analysis of the competition results revealed insights about the trade-off between grasp success and coverage, the surprisingly strong achievements of hand-engineered methods and a significant discrepancy between competition performance and prior work, underscoring the importance of independent, out-of-the-lab evaluation in robotic cloth manipulation. The associated dataset is a valuable resource for developing and evaluating grasp selection methods, particularly for learning-based approaches. We hope that our benchmark, dataset and competition results can serve as a foundation for future benchmarks and drive further progress in data-driven robotic cloth manipulation. The dataset and benchmarking code are available at https://airo.ugent.be/cloth_competition.</p></details> | submitted to IJRR |
| **[ROS-related Robotic Systems Development with V-model-based Application of MeROS Metamodel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08706v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Systems built on the Robot Operating System (ROS) are increasingly easy to assemble, yet hard to govern and reliably coordinate. Beyond the sheer number of subsystems involved, the difficulty stems from their diversity and interaction depth. In this paper, we use a compact heterogeneous robotic system (HeROS), combining mobile and manipulation capabilities, as a demonstration vehicle under dynamically changing tasks. Notably, all its subsystems are powered by ROS. The use of compatible interfaces and other ROS integration capabilities simplifies the construction of such systems. However, this only addresses part of the complexity: the semantic coherence and structural traceability are even more important for precise coordination and call for deliberate engineering methods. The Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) discipline, which emerged from the experience of complexity management in large-scale engineering domains, offers the methodological foundations needed. Despite their strengths in complementary aspects of robotics systems engineering, the lack of a unified approach to integrate ROS and MBSE hinders the full potential of these tools. Motivated by the anticipated impact of such a synergy in robotics practice, we propose a structured methodology based on MeROS - a SysML metamodel created specifically to put the ROS-based systems into the focus of the MBSE workflow. As its methodological backbone, we adapt the well-known V-model to this context, illustrating how complex robotic systems can be designed with traceability and validation capabilities embedded into their lifecycle using practices familiar to engineering teams.</p></details> | 22 pages |

These robots are prone to undesirable behaviours like sinking and slipping on challenging terrains. To combat this issue, we propose a terrain classifier that provides information on terrain type that can be used in robotic systems to create a traversability map to plan safer paths for the robot to navigate. The work presented here is a terrain classifier developed for a Boston Dynamics Spot robot. Spot provides over 100 measured proprioceptive signals describing the motions of the robot and its four legs (e.g., foot penetration, forces, joint angles, etc.). The developed terrain classifier combines dimensionality reduction techniques to extract relevant information from the signals and then applies a classification technique to differentiate terrain based on traversability. In representative field testing, the resulting terrain classifier was able to identify three different terrain types with an accuracy of approximately 97%</p></details> |  |
| **[TAGA: A Tangent-Based Reactive Approach for Socially Compliant Robot Navigation Around Human Groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21168v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot navigation in densely populated environments presents significant challenges, particularly regarding the interplay between individual and group dynamics. Current navigation models predominantly address interactions with individual pedestrians while failing to account for human groups that naturally form in real-world settings. Conversely, the limited models implementing group-aware navigation typically prioritize group dynamics at the expense of individual interactions, both of which are essential for socially appropriate navigation. This research extends an existing simulation framework to incorporate both individual pedestrians and human groups. We present Tangent Action for Group Avoidance (TAGA), a modular reactive mechanism that can be integrated with existing navigation frameworks to enhance their group-awareness capabilities. TAGA dynamically modifies robot trajectories using tangent action-based avoidance strategies while preserving the underlying model's capacity to navigate around individuals. Additionally, we introduce Group Collision Rate (GCR), a novel metric to quantitatively assess how effectively robots maintain group integrity during navigation. Through comprehensive simulation-based benchmarking, we demonstrate that integrating TAGA with state-of-the-art navigation models (ORCA, Social Force, DS-RNN, and AG-RL) reduces group intrusions by 45.7-78.6% while maintaining comparable success rates and navigation efficiency. Future work will focus on real-world implementation and validation of this approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures.

However, creating an integrated structural system that can effectively balance the competing requirements of high packing efficiency, simple deployment, and precise morphing into multiple load-bearing configurations remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a new class of hyper-Yoshimura origami, which exhibits a wide range of kinematically admissible and locally metastable states, including newly discovered symmetric "self-packing" and asymmetric "pop-out" states. This metastability is achieved by breaking a design rule of Yoshimura origami that has been in place for many decades. To this end, this study derives a new set of mathematically rigorous design rules and geometric formulations. Based on this, forward and inverse kinematic strategies are developed to stack hyper-Yoshimura modules into deployable booms that can approximate complex 3D shapes. Finally, this study showcases the potential of hyper-Yoshimura with a meter-scale pop-up cellphone charging station deployed at our university's bus transit station, along with a 3D-printed, scaled prototype of a space crane that can function as an object manipulator, solar tracking device, or high-load-bearing structure. These results establish hyper-Yoshimura as a promising platform for deployable and adaptable robotic systems in both terrestrial and space environments.</p></details> |  |

Exploring the Effects of a Structured Interface with ChatGPT in a Graduate Robotics Course](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07767v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior research shows that how students engage with Large Language Models (LLMs) influences their problem-solving and understanding, reinforcing the need to support productive LLM-uses that promote learning. This study evaluates the impact of a structured GPT platform designed to promote 'good' prompting behavior with data from 58 students in a graduate-level robotics course. The students were assigned to either an intervention group using the structured platform or a control group using ChatGPT freely for two practice lab sessions, before a third session where all students could freely use ChatGPT. We analyzed student perception (pre-post surveys), prompting behavior (logs), performance (task scores), and learning (pre-post tests). Although we found no differences in performance or learning between groups, we identified prompting behaviors - such as having clear prompts focused on understanding code - that were linked with higher learning gains and were more prominent when students used the structured platform. However, such behaviors did not transfer once students were no longer constrained to use the structured platform. Qualitative survey data showed mixed perceptions: some students perceived the value of the structured platform, but most did not perceive its relevance and resisted changing their habits. These findings contribute to ongoing efforts to identify effective strategies for integrating LLMs into learning and question the effectiveness of bottom-up approaches that temporarily alter user interfaces to influence students' interaction. Future research could instead explore top-down strategies that address students' motivations and explicitly demonstrate how certain interaction patterns support learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted, to appear in the proceedings of the EC-TEL 2025 conference</p></details> |

The proposed approach addresses the challenges of chattering, unknown disturbances, and rotational motion tracking, making it suited for high-DOF manipulators in dexterous manipulation tasks. A rigorous boundedness proof is provided, offering gain selection guidelines for practical implementation. Simulations and hardware experiments with external disturbances demonstrate the proposed controller's robust, accurate tracking with reduced control effort under unknown disturbances compared to other NT-STSM and conventional controllers. The results demonstrated that the proposed NT-STSM controller mitigates chattering and instability in complex motions, making it a viable solution for dexterous robotic manipulations and various industrial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics. 12 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |

However, it comes with a significant increase in the time spent on its planning, which intensifies when using complex technologies, such as social robots. Furthermore, addressing multicultural integration is commonly embedded in regular activities due to the already tight curriculum. Addressing these issues with a single solution, we implemented an intuitive interface that allows teachers to create scenario-based activities from their regular curriculum using LLMs and social robots. We co-designed different frameworks of activities with 4 teachers and deployed it in a study with 27 students for 1 week. Beyond validating the system's efficacy, our findings highlight the positive impact of integration policies perceived by the children and demonstrate the importance of scenario-based activities in students' enjoyment, observed to be significantly higher when applying storytelling. Additionally, several implications of using LLMs and social robots in long-term classroom activities are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published in the proceedings of 34th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN) in 2025</p></details> |
| **[Neural Robot Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15755v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators, capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world data; however, existing neural simulators typically require application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state. In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.</p></details> |  |
| **[ILeSiA: Interactive Learning of Robot Situational Awareness from Camera Input](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20173v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from demonstration is a promising approach for teaching robots new skills. However, a central challenge in the execution of acquired skills is the ability to recognize faults and prevent failures. This is essential because demonstrations typically cover only a limited set of scenarios and often only the successful ones. During task execution, unforeseen situations may arise, such as changes in the robot's environment or interaction with human operators. To recognize such situations, this paper focuses on teaching the robot situational awareness by using a camera input and labeling frames as safe or risky. We train a Gaussian Process (GP) regression model fed by a low-dimensional latent space representation of the input images. The model outputs a continuous risk score ranging from zero to one, quantifying the degree of risk at each timestep. This allows for pausing task execution in unsafe situations and directly adding new training data, labeled by the human user. Our experiments on a robotic manipulator show that the proposed method can reliably detect both known and novel faults using only a single example for each new fault. In contrast, a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) performs well only on faults it has encountered during training. Our method enables the next generation of cobots to be rapidly deployed with easy-to-set-up, vision-based risk assessment, proactively safeguarding humans and detecting misaligned parts or missing objects before failures occur. We provide all the code and data required to reproduce our experiments at imitrob.ciirc.cvut.cz/publications/ilesia.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Universal Dancing by Luminous Robots under Sequential Schedulers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15484v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Dancing problem requires a swarm of $n$ autonomous mobile robots to form a sequence of patterns, aka perform a choreography. Existing work has proven that some crucial restrictions on choreographies and initial configurations (e.g., on repetitions of patterns, periodicity, symmetries, contractions/expansions) must hold so that the Dancing problem can be solved under certain robot models. Here, we prove that these necessary constraints can be dropped by considering the LUMI model (i.e., where robots are endowed with a light whose color can be chosen from a constant-size palette) under the quite unexplored sequential scheduler. We formalize the class of Universal Dancing problems which require a swarm of $n$ robots starting from any initial configuration to perform a (periodic or finite) sequence of arbitrary patterns, only provided that each pattern consists of $n$ vertices (including multiplicities). However, we prove that, to be solvable under LUMI, the length of the feasible choreographies is bounded by the compositions of $n$ into the number of colors available to the robots. We provide an algorithm solving the Universal Dancing problem by exploiting the peculiar capability of sequential robots to implement a distributed counter mechanism. Even assuming non-rigid movements, our algorithm ensures spatial homogeneity of the performed choreography.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Policy: Guiding Visuomotor Robotic Manipulation with Spatial-Aware Modeling and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15874v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-centric hierarchical embodied models have demonstrated strong potential for long-horizon robotic control. However, existing methods lack spatial awareness capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in bridging visual plans to actionable control in complex environments. To address this problem, we propose Spatial Policy (SP), a unified spatial-aware visuomotor robotic manipulation framework via explicit spatial modeling and reasoning. Specifically, we first design a spatial-conditioned embodied video generation module to model spatially guided predictions through a spatial plan table. Then, we propose a spatial-based action prediction module to infer executable actions with coordination. Finally, we propose a spatial reasoning feedback policy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning. Extensive experiments show that SP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 33.0% average improvement over the best baseline. With an 86.7% average success rate across 11 diverse tasks, SP substantially enhances the practicality of embodied models for robotic control applications.

Among these, quadruped robots with manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations. However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces. Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot, demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.</p></details> |  |

To explore this future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots, and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these, Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>websi...</summary><p>website https://virtual-community-ai.github.io/</p></details> |

This remains challenging in traditional approaches, especially with arbitrarily shaped predictions and real-time constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Risk-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral control (DRA-MPPI), a motion planner that incorporates uncertain future motions modelled with potentially non-Gaussian stochastic predictions. By leveraging MPPI's gradient-free nature, we propose a method that efficiently approximates the joint Collision Probability (CP) among multiple dynamic obstacles for several hundred sampled trajectories in real-time via a Monte Carlo (MC) approach. This enables the rejection of samples exceeding a predefined CP threshold or the integration of CP as a weighted objective within the navigation cost function. Consequently, DRA-MPPI mitigates the freezing robot problem while enhancing safety. Real-world and simulated experiments with multiple dynamic obstacles demonstrate DRA-MPPI's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, including Scenario-based Model Predictive Control (S-MPC), Frenet planner, and vanilla MPPI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at IROS 2025.

Automated technology has the potential to support the meat industry, assist workers, and enhance job quality. However, existing automation in meat processing is highly specialized, inflexible, and cost intensive. Instead of forcing manufacturers to buy a separate device for each step of the process, our objective is to develop general-purpose robotic systems that work alongside humans to perform multiple meat processing tasks. Through a recently conducted survey of industry experts, we identified two main challenges associated with integrating these collaborative robots alongside human workers. First, there must be measures to ensure the safety of human coworkers; second, the coworkers need to understand what the robot is doing. This paper addresses both challenges by introducing a safety and transparency framework for general-purpose meat processing robots. For safety, we implement a hand-detection system that continuously monitors nearby humans. This system can halt the robot in situations where the human comes into close proximity of the operating robot. We also develop an instrumented knife equipped with a force sensor that can differentiate contact between objects such as meat, bone, or fixtures. For transparency, we introduce a method that detects the robot's uncertainty about its performance and uses an LED interface to communicate that uncertainty to the human. Additionally, we design a graphical interface that displays the robot's plans and allows the human to provide feedback on the planned cut. Overall, our framework can ensure safe operation while keeping human workers in-the-loop about the robot's actions which we validate through a user study.</p></details> |  |

Calibrating UWB anchors manually can be time-consuming and even impossible in emergencies or those situations without special calibration tools. Therefore, automatic estimation of the anchor positions becomes a necessity. The proposed method enables the creation of a soft sensor providing the position information of the anchors in a UWB network. This soft sensor requires only UWB and LiDAR measurements measured from a moving robot. The proposed FGO framework is suitable for the calibration of an extendable large UWB network. Moreover, the anchor calibration problem and robot localization problem can be solved simultaneously, which saves time for UWB network deployment. The proposed framework also helps to avoid artificial errors in the UWB-anchor position estimation and improves the accuracy and robustness of the robot-pose. The experimental results of the robot localization using LiDAR and a UWB network in a 3D environment are discussed, demonstrating the performance of the proposed method. More specifically, the anchor calibration problem with four anchors and the robot localization problem can be solved simultaneously and automatically within 30 seconds by the proposed framework. The supplementary video and codes can be accessed via https://github.com/LiuxhRobotAI/Simultaneous_calibration_localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submit to IEEE SMC 2025.

However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity, offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of visual-language models across reasoning levels.</p></details> |  |

Recent large language model (LLMs)-based approaches for scene reasoning and planning primarily focus on one-shot, end-to-end solutions in known environments, lacking both dynamic adaptation capabilities for online operation and explainability in the processes of planning. To address these issues, a novel framework (DEXTER-LLM) for dynamic task planning in unknown environments, integrates four modules: (i) a mission comprehension module that resolves partial ordering of tasks specified by natural languages or linear temporal logic formulas (LTL); (ii) an online subtask generator based on LLMs that improves the accuracy and explainability of task decomposition via multi-stage reasoning; (iii) an optimal subtask assigner and scheduler that allocates subtasks to robots via search-based optimization; and (iv) a dynamic adaptation and human-in-the-loop verification module that implements multi-rate, event-based updates for both subtasks and their assignments, to cope with new features and tasks detected online. The framework effectively combines LLMs' open-world reasoning capabilities with the optimality of model-based assignment methods, simultaneously addressing the critical issue of online adaptability and explainability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate exceptional performances, with 100% success rates across all scenarios, 160 tasks and 480 subtasks completed on average (3 times the baselines), 62% less queries to LLMs during adaptation, and superior plan quality (2 times higher) for compound tasks.

| **[Multi-Robot Navigation in Social Mini-Games: Definitions, Taxonomy, and Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13459v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ``Last Mile Challenge'' has long been considered an important, yet unsolved, challenge for autonomous vehicles, public service robots, and delivery robots. A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to navigate constrained and cluttered environments that have high agency (e.g., doorways, hallways, corridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and humans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). Traditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs, which has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers. However, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on centralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation, etc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described informally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc representation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting to start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own taxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research moving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a well-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly. It also discusses the essential properties of SMG solvers, defines what SMGs are and how they appear in practice, outlines how to evaluate SMG solvers, and highlights the differences between SMG solvers and general navigation systems. The survey concludes with an overview of future directions and open challenges in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-optimal Asynchronous Minimal Vertex Covering by Myopic Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14247v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a connected graph with an autonomous robot swarm with limited visibility, it is natural to ask whether the robots can be deployed to certain vertices satisfying a given property using only local knowledge. This paper affirmatively answers the question with a set of \emph{myopic} (finite visibility range) luminous robots with the aim of \emph{filling a minimal vertex cover} (MVC) of a given graph $G = (V, E)$. The graph has special vertices, called \emph{doors}, through which robots enter sequentially. Starting from the doors, the goal of the robots is to settle on a set of vertices that forms a minimal vertex cover of $G$ under the asynchronous ($\mathcal{ASYNC}$) scheduler. We are also interested in achieving the \emph{minimum vertex cover} (MinVC, which is NP-hard \cite{Karp1972} for general graphs) for a specific graph class using the myopic robots. We establish lower bounds on the visibility range for the robots and on the time complexity (which is $\Omega(|E|)$). We present two algorithms for trees: one for single door, which is both time and memory-optimal, and the other for multiple doors, which is memory-optimal and achieves time-optimality when the number of doors is a constant. Interestingly, our technique achieves MinVC on trees with a single door. We then move to the general graph, where we present two algorithms, one for the single door and the other for the multiple doors with an extra memory of $O(\log \Delta)$ for the robots, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of $G$. All our algorithms run in $O(|E|)$ epochs.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm, offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action gap in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Embod...</summary><p>Embodied-R1 technical report</p></details> |
| **[The Social Context of Human-Robot Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13982v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) community often highlights the social context of an interaction as a key consideration when designing, implementing, and evaluating robot behavior. Unfortunately, researchers use the term "social context" in varied ways. This can lead to miscommunication, making it challenging to draw connections between related work on understanding and modeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions. To address this gap, we survey the HRI literature for existing definitions and uses of the term "social context". Then, we propose a conceptual model for describing the social context of a human-robot interaction. We apply this model to existing work, and we discuss a range of attributes of social contexts that can help researchers plan for interactions, develop behavior models for robots, and gain insights after interactions have taken place. We conclude with a discussion of open research questions in relation to understanding and modeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Annual Review of Control, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems</p></details> |

To achieve that, HRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. To achieve that, HRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. In this position paper, we outline an interaction-based framework for building trust through mutual understanding between humans and robots. We emphasize two main pillars: human awareness and transparency, referring to the robot ability to interpret human actions accurately and to clearly communicate its intentions and goals, respectively. By integrating these two pillars, robots can behave in a manner that aligns with human expectations and needs while providing their human partners with both comprehension and control over their actions. We also introduce four components that we think are important for bridging the gap between a human-perceived sense of trust and a robot true capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, presented at TRUST workshop, organised in conjunction with the IEEE RO-MAN 2025 conference, held in Eindhoven, Netherlands</p></details> |
| **[Toward Deployable Multi-Robot Collaboration via a Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13877v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential in robotic operations. However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such as multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a promising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence modeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations still remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a neuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable multi-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic planner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic subgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer (GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot manipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable, and generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks. We evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work to explore DT-based technology for multi-robot manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blast Hole Seeking and Dipping -- The Navigation and Perception Framework in a Mine Site Inspection Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13785v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In open-pit mining, holes are drilled into the surface of the excavation site and detonated with explosives to facilitate digging. These blast holes need to be inspected internally for investigation of downhole material types and properties. Knowing these properties can lead to significant savings in material handling costs in downstream processes. Manual hole inspection is slow and expensive, with major limitations in revealing the geometric and geological properties of the holes and their contents. This has been the motivation for the development of our autonomous mine-site inspection robot - "DIPPeR". In this paper, the automation aspect of the project is explained. We present a robust blast hole seeking and detection framework that enables target-based navigation and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. The pipeline first processes point-cloud data collected by the on-board LiDAR sensors, extracting the cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above the ground. By projecting the 3D cone points into a virtual depth image, segmentation is achieved in the 2D domain, yielding a circular hole at the image centre and a collared cone face. We then identify the hole centre using a robust detection module while suppressing non-maximum candidates, ensuring precise sensor placement for down-hole inspection and avoiding collisions with the cavity wall. To enable autonomous hole-seeking, the pipeline automatically adjusts its projection parameters during robot navigation to account for variations in point sparsity and hole opening size, ensuring a consistent hole appearance in 2D images. This allows continuous tracking of the target hole as the robot approaches the goal point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our navigation and perception system in both high-fidelity simulation environments and on-site field tests.

Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators, interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/anas-gouda/mr6d.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted CVPR 2025 Workshop on Recovering 6D Object Pose (R6D)</p></details> |

However, current gaze-based assistive systems mainly help users with basic grasping actions, offering limited support. Moreover, the restricted intent recognition capability constrains the assistive system's ability to provide diverse assistance functions. In this paper, we propose an open implicit intention recognition framework powered by Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Foundation Model (VFM), which can process gaze input and recognize user intents that are not confined to predefined or specific scenarios. Furthermore, we implement a gaze-driven LLM-enhanced assistive robot system (MindEye-OmniAssist) that recognizes user's intentions through gaze and assists in completing task. To achieve this, the system utilizes open vocabulary object detector, intention recognition network and LLM to infer their full intentions. By integrating eye movement feedback and LLM, it generates action sequences to assist the user in completing tasks. Real-world experiments have been conducted for assistive tasks, and the system achieved an overall success rate of 41/55 across various undefined tasks. Preliminary results show that the proposed method holds the potential to provide a more user-friendly human-computer interaction interface and significantly enhance the versatility and effectiveness of assistive systems by supporting more complex and diverse task.</p></details> |  |

| **[Assessing Pedestrian Behavior Around Autonomous Cleaning Robots in Public Spaces: Findings from a Field Observation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13699v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As autonomous robots become more common in public spaces, spontaneous encounters with laypersons are more frequent. For this, robots need to be equipped with communication strategies that enhance momentary transparency and reduce the probability of critical situations. Adapting these robotic strategies requires consideration of robot movements, environmental conditions, and user characteristics and states. While numerous studies have investigated the impact of distraction on pedestrians' movement behavior, limited research has examined this behavior in the presence of autonomous robots. This research addresses the impact of robot type and robot movement pattern on distracted and undistracted pedestrians' movement behavior. In a field setting, unaware pedestrians were videotaped while moving past two working, autonomous cleaning robots. Out of N=498 observed pedestrians, approximately 8% were distracted by smartphones. Distracted and undistracted pedestrians did not exhibit significant differences in their movement behaviors around the robots. Instead, both the larger sweeping robot and the offset rectangular movement pattern significantly increased the number of lateral adaptations compared to the smaller cleaning robot and the circular movement pattern. The offset rectangular movement pattern also led to significantly more close lateral adaptations. Depending on the robot type, the movement patterns led to differences in the distances of lateral adaptations. The study provides initial insights into pedestrian movement behavior around an autonomous cleaning robot in public spaces, contributing to the growing field of HRI research.</p></details> |  |

However, standardized benchmarks for evaluating robotic athletic performance in real-world settings and in direct comparison to humans remain scarce. We present Switch4EAI(Switch-for-Embodied-AI), a low-cost and easily deployable pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games to evaluate whole-body robot control policies. Using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch as a representative example, our system captures, reconstructs, and retargets in-game choreography for robotic execution. We validate the system on a Unitree G1 humanoid with an open-source whole-body controller, establishing a quantitative baseline for the robot's performance against a human player. In the paper, we discuss these results, which demonstrate the feasibility of using commercial games platform as physically grounded benchmarks and motivate future work to for benchmarking embodied AI.</p></details> | Workshop Submission |
| **[Integrating emotional intelligence, memory architecture, and gestures to achieve empathetic humanoid robot interaction in an educational setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19803v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the integration of individual human traits into an empathetically adaptive educational robot tutor system designed to improve student engagement and learning outcomes with corresponding Engagement Vector measurement. While prior research in the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has examined the integration of the traits, such as emotional intelligence, memory-driven personalization, and non-verbal communication, by themselves, they have thus-far neglected to consider their synchronized integration into a cohesive, operational education framework. To address this gap, we customize a Multi-Modal Large Language Model (LLaMa 3.2 from Meta) deployed with modules for human-like traits (emotion, memory and gestures) into an AI-Agent framework. This constitutes to the robot's intelligent core mimicing the human emotional system, memory architecture and gesture control to allow the robot to behave more empathetically while recognizing and responding appropriately to the student's emotional state. It can also recall the student's past learning record and adapt its style of interaction accordingly. This allows the robot tutor to react to the student in a more sympathetic manner by delivering personalized verbal feedback synchronized with relevant gestures. Our study investigates the extent of this effect through the introduction of Engagement Vector Model which can be a surveyor's pole for judging the quality of HRI experience. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that such an empathetic responsive approach significantly improves student engagement and learning outcomes compared with a baseline humanoid robot without these human-like traits. This indicates that robot tutors with empathetic capabilities can create a more supportive, interactive learning experience that ultimately leads to better outcomes for the student.</p></details> |  |

The system uses two Raspberry Pi 4 units: a front unit on a differential drive base with camera, mic, and speaker, and a central unit that serves the live feed and runs perception. Video is sent with FFmpeg. Objects in the scene are detected using YOLOv3 to support navigation and event awareness. For voice interaction, we use Python libraries for speech recognition, multilingual translation, and text-to-speech, so the robot can take spoken commands and read back responses in the requested language. A Kinect RGB-D sensor provides visual input and obstacle cues. In indoor tests the robot detects common objects at interactive frame rates on CPU, recognises commands reliably, and translates them to actions without manual control. The design relies on off-the-shelf hardware and open software, making it easy to reproduce. We discuss limits and practical extensions, including sensor fusion with ultrasonic range data, GPU acceleration, and adding face and text recognition.</p></details> | 4 pages, 5 figures |

In this research, HRL is evaluated and contrasted with traditional RL in complex robotic navigation tasks. We evaluate unique characteristics of HRL, including its ability to create sub-goals and the termination functions. We constructed a number of experiments to test: 1) the differences between RL proximal policy optimization (PPO) and HRL, 2) different ways of creating sub-goals in HRL, 3) manual vs automatic sub-goal creation in HRL, and 4) the effects of the frequency of termination on performance in HRL. These experiments highlight the advantages of HRL over RL and how it achieves these advantages.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the "sub"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at https://weirdlabuw.github.io/strap/</p></details> |

In contrast, most existing robotic systems rely on carefully positioned fixed or multi-camera setups with complete scene visibility, which limits adaptability and incurs high hardware costs. We present \textbf{RoboRetriever}, a novel framework for real-world object retrieval that operates using only a \textbf{single} wrist-mounted RGB-D camera and free-form natural language instructions. RoboRetriever grounds visual observations to build and update a \textbf{dynamic hierarchical scene graph} that encodes object semantics, geometry, and inter-object relations over time. The supervisor module reasons over this memory and task instruction to infer the target object and coordinate an integrated action module combining \textbf{active perception}, \textbf{interactive perception}, and \textbf{manipulation}. To enable task-aware scene-grounded active perception, we introduce a novel visual prompting scheme that leverages large reasoning vision-language models to determine 6-DoF camera poses aligned with the semantic task goal and geometry scene context. We evaluate RoboRetriever on diverse real-world object retrieval tasks, including scenarios with human intervention, demonstrating strong adaptability and robustness in cluttered scenes with only one RGB-D camera.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Model-Predictive Control of a Soft Continuum Robot Using a Physics-Informed Neural Network Based on Cosserat Rod Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12681v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic control of soft continuum robots (SCRs) holds great potential for expanding their applications, but remains a challenging problem due to the high computational demands of accurate dynamic models. While data-driven approaches like Koopman-operator-based methods have been proposed, they typically lack adaptability and cannot capture the full robot shape, limiting their applicability. This work introduces a real-time-capable nonlinear model-predictive control (MPC) framework for SCRs based on a domain-decoupled physics-informed neural network (DD-PINN) with adaptable bending stiffness. The DD-PINN serves as a surrogate for the dynamic Cosserat rod model with a speed-up factor of 44000. It is also used within an unscented Kalman filter for estimating the model states and bending compliance from end-effector position measurements. We implement a nonlinear evolutionary MPC running at 70 Hz on the GPU. In simulation, it demonstrates accurate tracking of dynamic trajectories and setpoint control with end-effector position errors below 3 mm (2.3% of the actuator's length). In real-world experiments, the controller achieves similar accuracy and accelerations up to 3.55 m/s2.</p></details> | 20 pages, 15 figures |

However, does the the image quality of Robot-Generated Content (RGC) demonstrate traits consistent with the Moravec paradox, potentially conflicting with human perceptual norms? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the perception mechanism of embodied robots for image quality. We propose the first Embodied Preference Database (EPD), which contains 12,500 distorted image annotations. We establish assessment metrics based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, there is a gap between UGC and RGC. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-scale Attention Embodied Image Quality Assessment called MA-EIQA. For the proposed EPD dataset, this is the first no-reference IQA model designed for embodied robot. Finally, the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment.
