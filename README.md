| **[SceneGen: Single-Image 3D Scene Generation in One Feedforward Pass](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15769v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture. Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval; (ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of 3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass; (iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation, potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code and model will be publicly available at: https://mengmouxu.github.io/SceneGen.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report; Project Page: https://mengmouxu.github.io/SceneGen</p></details> |
| **[Mind and Motion Aligned: A Joint Evaluation IsaacSim Benchmark for Task Planning and Low-Level Policies in Mobile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15663v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI. However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution, and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands. This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500 complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot. We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Survey of Vision-Language-Action Models for Embodied Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15201v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied intelligence systems, which enhance agent capabilities through continuous environment interactions, have garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. Vision-Language-Action models, inspired by advancements in large foundation models, serve as universal robotic control frameworks that substantially improve agent-environment interaction capabilities in embodied intelligence systems. This expansion has broadened application scenarios for embodied AI robots. This survey comprehensively reviews VLA models for embodied manipulation. Firstly, it chronicles the developmental trajectory of VLA architectures. Subsequently, we conduct a detailed analysis of current research across 5 critical dimensions: VLA model structures, training datasets, pre-training methods, post-training methods, and model evaluation. Finally, we synthesize key challenges in VLA development and real-world deployment, while outlining promising future research directions.</p></details> | in Chinese language |
| **[Open-Universe Assistance Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15119v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting, we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by both LLM-based and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages + 2 pages references + 7 pages appendix</p></details> |
| **[JRDB-Reasoning: A Difficulty-Graded Benchmark for Visual Reasoning in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10287v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity, offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of visual-language models across reasoning levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied-R1: Reinforced Embodied Reasoning for General Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13998v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalization in embodied AI is hindered by the "seeing-to-doing gap," which stems from data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity. To address this, we pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm, offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action gap in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Embod...</summary><p>Embodied-R1 technical report</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Data Storage and Retrieval for Embodied AI: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13901v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI (EAI) agents continuously interact with the physical world, generating vast, heterogeneous multimodal data streams that traditional management systems are ill-equipped to handle. In this survey, we first systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases, Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than 180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust, high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation of autonomous embodied systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528v5)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p></details> | CoRL 2025 |
| **[Switch4EAI: Leveraging Console Game Platform for Benchmarking Robotic Athletics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13444v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in whole-body robot control have enabled humanoid and legged robots to execute increasingly agile and coordinated movements. However, standardized benchmarks for evaluating robotic athletic performance in real-world settings and in direct comparison to humans remain scarce. We present Switch4EAI(Switch-for-Embodied-AI), a low-cost and easily deployable pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games to evaluate whole-body robot control policies. Using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch as a representative example, our system captures, reconstructs, and retargets in-game choreography for robotic execution. We validate the system on a Unitree G1 humanoid with an open-source whole-body controller, establishing a quantitative baseline for the robot's performance against a human player. In the paper, we discuss these results, which demonstrate the feasibility of using commercial games platform as physically grounded benchmarks and motivate future work to for benchmarking embodied AI.</p></details> | Workshop Submission |
| **[Virtuous Machines: Towards Artificial General Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13421v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness, executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments, accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored. It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and the attribution of scientific credit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large VLM-based Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13073v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation, a key frontier in robotics and embodied AI, requires precise motor control and multimodal understanding, yet traditional rule-based methods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured, novel environments. In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation. We provide a regularly updated project page to document ongoing progress: https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/Large-VLM-based-VLA-for-Robotic-Manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/Large-VLM-based-VLA-for-Robotic-Manipulation</p></details> |
| **[Embodied Image Quality Assessment for Robotic Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18774v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Quality Assessment (IQA) of User-Generated Content (UGC) is a critical technique for human Quality of Experience (QoE). However, does the the image quality of Robot-Generated Content (RGC) demonstrate traits consistent with the Moravec paradox, potentially conflicting with human perceptual norms? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the perception mechanism of embodied robots for image quality. We propose the first Embodied Preference Database (EPD), which contains 12,500 distorted image annotations. We establish assessment metrics based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, there is a gap between UGC and RGC. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-scale Attention Embodied Image Quality Assessment called MA-EIQA. For the proposed EPD dataset, this is the first no-reference IQA model designed for embodied robot. Finally, the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Jianbo-maker/EPD_benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[FormCoach: Lift Smarter, Not Harder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07501v2)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Good form is the difference between strength and strain, yet for the fast-growing community of at-home fitness enthusiasts, expert feedback is often out of reach. FormCoach transforms a simple camera into an always-on, interactive AI training partner, capable of spotting subtle form errors and delivering tailored corrections in real time, leveraging vision-language models (VLMs). We showcase this capability through a web interface and benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs on a dataset of 1,700 expert-annotated user-reference video pairs spanning 22 strength and mobility exercises. To accelerate research in AI-driven coaching, we release both the dataset and an automated, rubric-based evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized comparison across models. Our benchmarks reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level coaching, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in integrating nuanced, context-aware movement analysis into interactive AI systems. By framing form correction as a collaborative and creative process between humans and machines, FormCoach opens a new frontier in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Affordance-Aware Robotic Dexterous Grasping with Human-like Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08896v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A dexterous hand capable of generalizable grasping objects is fundamental for the development of general-purpose embodied AI. However, previous methods focus narrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordance-aware positioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, a novel framework with two-stage training that learns a universal grasping policy with an inherent understanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage, a trajectory imitator is pre-trained on a large corpus of human hand motions to instill a strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, a residual module is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object instances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative Affordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally inappropriate contact regions, and a privileged teacher-student distillation process that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal dexterous grasping but also remains remarkably human-like in posture and functionally appropriate in contact location. As a result, AffordDex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seen objects, unseen instances, and even entirely novel categories.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Large Model Empowered Embodied AI: A Survey on Decision-Making and Embodied Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10399v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI aims to develop intelligent systems with physical forms capable of perceiving, decision-making, acting, and learning in real-world environments, providing a promising way to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite decades of explorations, it remains challenging for embodied agents to achieve human-level intelligence for general-purpose tasks in open dynamic environments. Recent breakthroughs in large models have revolutionized embodied AI by enhancing perception, interaction, planning and learning. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on large model empowered embodied AI, focusing on autonomous decision-making and embodied learning. We investigate both hierarchical and end-to-end decision-making paradigms, detailing how large models enhance high-level planning, low-level execution, and feedback for hierarchical decision-making, and how large models enhance Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end decision making. For embodied learning, we introduce mainstream learning methodologies, elaborating on how large models enhance imitation learning and reinforcement learning in-depth. For the first time, we integrate world models into the survey of embodied AI, presenting their design methods and critical roles in enhancing decision-making and learning. Though solid advances have been achieved, challenges still exist, which are discussed at the end of this survey, potentially as the further research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoSE: Skill-by-Skill Mixture-of-Experts Learning for Embodied Autonomous Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07818v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To meet the growing demand for smarter, faster, and more efficient embodied AI solutions, we introduce a novel Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) method that significantly boosts reasoning and learning efficiency for embodied autonomous systems. General MoE models demand extensive training data and complex optimization, which limits their applicability in embodied AI such as autonomous driving (AD) and robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose a skill-oriented MoE called MoSE, which mimics the human learning and reasoning process skill-by-skill, step-by-step. We introduce a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the necessary competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks, thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. To better align with multi-step planning in human reasoning and in end-to-end driving models, we build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the model to think step-by-step. Unlike other multi-round dialogues, MoSE integrates valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g. perception-prediction-planning for AD, and high-level and low-level planning for robots) in one single forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model effectively grows more diverse expertise and outperforms models on both AD corner-case reasoning tasks and robot reasoning tasks with less than 40% of the parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[UnrealZoo: Enriching Photo-realistic Virtual Worlds for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20977v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce UnrealZoo, a collection of over 100 photo-realistic 3D virtual worlds built on Unreal Engine, designed to reflect the complexity and variability of open-world environments. We also provide a rich variety of playable entities, including humans, animals, robots, and vehicles for embodied AI research. We extend UnrealCV with optimized APIs and tools for data collection, environment augmentation, distributed training, and benchmarking. These improvements achieve significant improvements in the efficiency of rendering and communication, enabling advanced applications such as multi-agent interactions. Our experimental evaluation across visual navigation and tracking tasks reveals two key insights: 1) environmental diversity provides substantial benefits for developing generalizable reinforcement learning (RL) agents, and 2) current embodied agents face persistent challenges in open-world scenarios, including navigation in unstructured terrain, adaptation to unseen morphologies, and managing latency in the close-loop control systems for interacting in highly dynamic objects. UnrealZoo thus serves as both a comprehensive testing ground and a pathway toward developing more capable embodied AI systems for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlight), Project page: http://unrealzoo.site/</p></details> |
| **[DiffPhysCam: Differentiable Physics-Based Camera Simulation for Inverse Rendering and Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08831v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce DiffPhysCam, a differentiable camera simulator designed to support robotics and embodied AI applications by enabling gradient-based optimization in visual perception pipelines. Generating synthetic images that closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins, facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using images generated by DiffPhysCam.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 17 figures, and 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[MEReQ: Max-Ent Residual-Q Inverse RL for Sample-Efficient Alignment from Intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16258v3)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning robot behavior with human preferences is crucial for deploying embodied AI agents in human-centered environments. A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |

This task requires the model to identify newly described objects that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view, posing a significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF. Our analysis reveals that 3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key challenges for R3DGS. To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language expressions in a spatially aware paradigm. ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the newly proposed R3DGS task and 3D open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks.

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[PANAMA: A Network-Aware MARL Framework for Multi-Agent Path Finding in Digital Twin Ecosystems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06767v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital Twins (DTs) are transforming industries through advanced data processing and analysis, positioning the world of DTs, Digital World, as a cornerstone of nextgeneration technologies including embodied AI. As robotics and automated systems scale, efficient data-sharing frameworks and robust algorithms become critical. We explore the pivotal role of data handling in next-gen networks, focusing on dynamics between application and network providers (AP/NP) in DT ecosystems. We introduce PANAMA, a novel algorithm with Priority Asymmetry for Network Aware Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based multi-agent path finding (MAPF). By adopting a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework and asynchronous actor-learner architectures, PANAMA accelerates training while enabling autonomous task execution by embodied AI. Our approach demonstrates superior pathfinding performance in accuracy, speed, and scalability compared to existing benchmarks. Through simulations, we highlight optimized data-sharing strategies for scalable, automated systems, ensuring resilience in complex, real-world environments. PANAMA bridges the gap between network-aware decision-making and robust multi-agent coordination, advancing the synergy between DTs, wireless networks, and AI-driven automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety of Embodied Navigation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05855v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain influence, the development of embodied AI has accelerated, drawing significant attention, particularly in navigation scenarios. Embodied navigation requires an agent to perceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a specified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied navigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development of safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the findings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety and increasing industrial efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniEAR: Benchmarking Agent Reasoning in Embodied Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05614v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to 56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically (0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zju-real.github.io/OmniEmbodied Code: https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/OmniEmbodied</p></details> |

In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentSense: Virtual Sensor Data Generation Using LLM Agents in Simulated Home Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11773v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge in developing robust and generalizable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems for smart homes is the lack of large and diverse labeled datasets. Variations in home layouts, sensor configurations, and individual behaviors further exacerbate this issue. To address this, we leverage the idea of embodied AI agents-virtual agents that perceive and act within simulated environments guided by internal world models. We introduce AgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline in which agents live out daily routines in simulated smart homes, with behavior guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM generates diverse synthetic personas and realistic routines grounded in the environment, which are then decomposed into fine-grained actions. These actions are executed in an extended version of the VirtualHome simulator, which we augment with virtual ambient sensors that record the agents' activities. Our approach produces rich, privacy-preserving sensor data that reflects real-world diversity. We evaluate AgentSense on five real HAR datasets. Models pretrained on the generated data consistently outperform baselines, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore, combining the generated virtual sensor data with a small amount of real data achieves performance comparable to training on full real-world datasets. These results highlight the potential of using LLM-guided embodied agents for scalable and cost-effective sensor data generation in HAR.</p></details> |  |
| **[IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16402v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.

It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents.

These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI, which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally, existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes (e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints. We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D spatial intelligence.

| **[Exploring 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Activity Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D task planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advances in multimodal learning. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v4)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Robotic Manipulation Generalization with Minimal Costly Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19516v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied AI intensifies the demand for diverse manipulation demonstrations. However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the RoboTron-Craft, a stage-divided and cost-effective pipeline for realistic manipulation generation. Base on this, the RoboTron-Platter method is introduced, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.

| **[Object Affordance Recognition and Grounding via Multi-scale Cross-modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01184v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification). Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance grounding and classification.</p></details> |  |

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising various rendering engines, a versatile toolchain, and a large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we integrate diverse rendering engines and advanced techniques for environment simulation, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of our environments. Secondly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for aerial VLN data collection, streamlining point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Thirdly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. Moreover, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model emphasizing key observations during flight. For benchmarking, extensive experiments and analyses are conducted, evaluating several recent VLN methods and showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |

We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Exploring the Link Between Bayesian Inference and Embodied Intelligence: Toward Open Physical-World Embodied AI Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21589v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open physical-world embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Robots with soft bodies are examples of such physical systems, and their nonlinear body-environment dynamics can be used to compute and generate the motor signals necessary for the control of their own behavior. In this simulation study, we extend this approach to control and embed not only one but also multiple behaviors into a type of soft robot called a tensegrity robot. The resulting system, consisting of the robot and the environment, is a multistable dynamical system that converges to different attractors from varying initial conditions. Furthermore, attractor analysis reveals that there exist "untrained attractors" in the state space of the system outside the training data. These untrained attractors reflect the intrinsic properties and structures of the tensegrity robot and its interactions with the environment. The impacts of these recent findings in PRC remain unexplored in embodied AI research. We here illustrate their potential to understand various features of embodied cognition that have not been fully addressed to date.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 12 figures.

Despite advances in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$, other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100% of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English, suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable navigation across linguistic contexts.</p></details> |  |

While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive, expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types, combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation) generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive humanoid motion generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://rosielab.github.io/compas3d</p></details> |

As a burgeoning research frontier, 4D generation enables richer interactive and immersive experiences, with applications ranging from digital humans to autonomous driving. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks a unified understanding of 4D representations, generative frameworks, basic paradigms, and the core technical challenges it faces. This survey provides a systematic and in-depth review of the 4D generation landscape. To comprehensively characterize 4D generation, we first categorize fundamental 4D representations and outline associated techniques for 4D generation. We then present an in-depth analysis of representative generative pipelines based on conditions and representation methods. Subsequently, we discuss how motion and geometry priors are integrated into 4D outputs to ensure spatio-temporal consistency under various control schemes. From an application perspective, this paper summarizes 4D generation tasks in areas such as dynamic object/scene generation, digital human synthesis, editable 4D content, and embodied AI. Furthermore, we summarize and multi-dimensionally compare four basic paradigms for 4D generation: End-to-End, Generated-Data-Based, Implicit-Distillation-Based, and Explicit-Supervision-Based. Concluding our analysis, we highlight five key challenges-consistency, controllability, diversity, efficiency, and fidelity-and contextualize these with current approaches.By distilling recent advances and outlining open problems, this work offers a comprehensive and forward-looking perspective to guide future research in 4D generation.</p></details> |  |

Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lanlan96.github.io/BoxFusion/</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jasper0314-huang.github.io/thinkact-vla/</p></details> |

Due to the rarity of system failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable embodied AI systems. Instead, empirical safety evaluation is employed as an alternative, but the absence of provable guarantees imposes significant limitations. To address these issues, we argue for a paradigm shift to provable probabilistic safety that integrates provable guarantees with progressive achievement toward a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance. The new paradigm better leverages statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability, and a well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be deployed at scale. In this Perspective, we outline a roadmap for provable probabilistic safety, along with corresponding challenges and potential solutions. By bridging the gap between theoretical safety assurance and practical deployment, this Perspective offers a pathway toward safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical applications.</p></details> |  |

| **[EgoPrune: Efficient Token Pruning for Egomotion Video Reasoning in Embodied Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15428v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egomotion videos are first-person recordings where the view changes continuously due to the agent's movement. As they serve as the primary visual input for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient is therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, but their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video inputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person videos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints inherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a training-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning. EgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR for temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering (PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and removes redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token selector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame diversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune consistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning ratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover, we deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB edge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for on-device egomotion video reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Existing 3D generation primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models, the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we propose \textbf{PhysX-3D}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material, affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models, which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2) Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research in generative physical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://physx-3d.github.io/</p></details> |

Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

As a result, we are seeing similar advancements in embodied AI and robotics for control policy generation. Our review paper examines the integration of generative AI models with RL to advance robotics. Our primary focus is on the duality between generative AI and RL for robotics downstream tasks. Specifically, we investigate: (1) The role of prominent generative AI tools as modular priors for multi-modal input fusion in RL tasks. (2) How RL can train, fine-tune and distill generative models for policy generation, such as VLA models, similarly to RL applications in large language models. We then propose a new taxonomy based on a considerable amount of selected papers. Lastly, we identify open challenges accounting for model scalability, adaptation and grounding, giving recommendations and insights on future research directions. We reflect on which generative AI models best fit the RL tasks and why. On the other side, we reflect on important issues inherent to RL-enhanced generative policies, such as safety concerns and failure modes, and what are the limitations of current methods.

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.

Embodied intelligence focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the physical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only advanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract cognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest. Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the integration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their complementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in intelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and internal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment. By synthesizing current progress and identifying open challenges, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the path toward more capable and generalizable embodied AI systems.

| **[View Invariant Learning for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08831v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training method.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[NavComposer: Composing Language Instructions for Navigation Trajectories through Action-Scene-Object Modularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10894v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-guided navigation is a cornerstone of embodied AI, enabling agents to interpret language instructions and navigate complex environments. However, expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects, and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training. Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively activates more neuron values in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Reasoning for Embodied Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22050v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied planning requires agents to make coherent multi-step decisions based on dynamic visual observations and natural language goals. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) excel at static perception tasks, they struggle with the temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and commonsense grounding needed for planning in interactive environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that brings R1-style reasoning enhancement into embodied planning. We first distill a high-quality dataset from a powerful closed-source model and perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with structured decision-making priors. We then design a rule-based reward function tailored to multi-step action quality and optimize the policy via Generalized Reinforced Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our approach is evaluated on Embench, a recent benchmark for interactive embodied tasks, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms models of similar or larger scale, including GPT-4o-mini and 70B+ open-source baselines, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen environments. This work highlights the potential of reinforcement-driven reasoning to advance long-horizon planning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Long-term Point Tracking in the Foundation Model Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09217v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However, real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets, offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines. However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time. Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks, demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2501.18487</p></details> |

To tackle these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models.

| **[SURPRISE3D: A Dataset for Spatial Understanding and Reasoning in Complex 3D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07781v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world. Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research. Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite. S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic planning.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoramic images, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 48 sequences, both indoors and outdoors.

| **[A Neural Representation Framework with LLM-Driven Spatial Reasoning for Open-Vocabulary 3D Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06719v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical feature field. This field represents language and instance features using distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations, outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their spatial reasoning capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attribution Regularization for Multimodal Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02359v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal machine learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for integrating information from multiple modalities to enhance learning and decision-making processes. However, it is commonly observed that unimodal models outperform multimodal models, despite the latter having access to richer information. Additionally, the influence of a single modality often dominates the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions. The focus of this project lies in the video-audio domain, although the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved. By leveraging this regularization term, the proposed approach aims to mitigate the issue of unimodal dominance and improve the performance of multimodal machine learning systems. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed technique will be assessed. The findings of this research project have the potential to significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal machine learning and facilitate its application in various domains, including multimedia analysis, human-computer interaction, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |

Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture, neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated asset generation.

With PAPRLE, a user can change the arrangement of the robotic limbs, and control them using a variety of input devices, including puppeteers, gaming controllers, and VR-based interfaces. This versatility supports a wide range of teleoperation scenarios and promotes adaptability to different task requirements. To further enhance configurability, we introduce a pluggable puppeteer device that can be easily mounted and adapted to match the target robot configurations. PAPRLE supports bilateral teleoperation through these puppeteer devices, agnostic to the type or configuration of the follower robot. By supporting both joint-space and task-space control, the system provides real-time force feedback, improving user fidelity and physical interaction awareness. The modular design of PAPRLE facilitates novel spatial arrangements of the limbs and enables scalable data collection, thereby advancing research in embodied AI and learning-based control. We validate PAPRLE in various real-world settings, demonstrating its versatility across diverse combinations of leader devices and follower robots. The system will be released as open source, including both hardware and software components, to support broader adoption and community-driven extension.

However, collecting such embodied data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner, a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap. It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74% compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by 89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning. Code, model and data will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://embodiedreamer.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Embodied AI Agents: Modeling the World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22355v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes our research on AI agents embodied in visual, virtual or physical forms, enabling them to interact with both users and their environments. These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices, and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings, which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents, allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-free Generation of Temporally Consistent Rewards from VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04789v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in embodied tasks such as goal decomposition and visual comprehension. However, providing accurate rewards for robotic manipulation without fine-tuning VLMs remains challenging due to the absence of domain-specific robotic knowledge in pre-trained datasets and high computational costs that hinder real-time applicability. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM, a novel training-free, temporally consistent framework that generates accurate rewards through tracking the status changes in VLM-derived subgoals. Specifically, our method first queries the VLM to establish spatially aware subgoals and an initial completion estimate before each round of interaction. We then employ a Bayesian tracking algorithm to update the goal completion status dynamically, using subgoal hidden states to generate structured rewards for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. This approach enhances long-horizon decision-making and improves failure recovery capabilities with RL. Extensive experiments indicate that $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in two robot manipulation benchmarks, demonstrating superior reward accuracy with reduced computation consumption. We believe our approach not only advances reward generation techniques but also contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://t2-vlm.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimLauncher: Launching Sample-Efficient Real-world Robotic Reinforcement Learning via Simulation Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04452v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous learning of dexterous, long-horizon robotic skills has been a longstanding pursuit of embodied AI. Recent advances in robotic reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable performance and robustness in real-world visuomotor control tasks. However, applying RL in the real world faces challenges such as low sample efficiency, slow exploration, and significant reliance on human intervention. In contrast, simulators offer a safe and efficient environment for extensive exploration and data collection, while the visual sim-to-real gap, often a limiting factor, can be mitigated using real-to-sim techniques. Building on these, we propose SimLauncher, a novel framework that combines the strengths of real-world RL and real-to-sim-to-real approaches to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we first pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment, which then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values using extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived from pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from the pre-trained policy for better exploration. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multi-stage, contact-rich, and dexterous hand manipulation tasks. Compared to prior real-world RL approaches, SimLauncher significantly improves sample efficiency and achieves near-perfect success rates. We hope this work serves as a proof of concept and inspires further research on leveraging large-scale simulation pre-training to benefit real-world robotic RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic 3D Scene Generation with Spatially Contextualized VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20129v3)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints. Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.

While single-arm systems have shown strong task performance, collaborative dual-arm systems are essential for handling more intricate tasks involving rigid, deformable, and tactile-sensitive objects. To advance this goal, we launched the RoboTwin Dual-Arm Collaboration Challenge at the 2nd MEIS Workshop, CVPR 2025. Built on the RoboTwin Simulation platform (1.0 and 2.0) and the AgileX COBOT-Magic Robot platform, the competition consisted of three stages: Simulation Round 1, Simulation Round 2, and a final Real-World Round. Participants totally tackled 17 dual-arm manipulation tasks, covering rigid, deformable, and tactile-based scenarios. The challenge attracted 64 global teams and over 400 participants, producing top-performing solutions like SEM and AnchorDP3 and generating valuable insights into generalizable bimanual policy learning. This report outlines the competition setup, task design, evaluation methodology, key findings and future direction, aiming to support future research on robust and generalizable bimanual manipulation policies.

Existing techniques generatively re-render the input video to realize the transfer, such as video relighting models and conditioned world generation models. Nevertheless, these models are predominantly limited to the domain of training data (e.g., portrait) or fall into the bottleneck of temporal consistency and computation efficiency, especially when the input video involves complex dynamics and long durations. In this paper, we propose TC-Light, a novel generative renderer to overcome these problems. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark. Extensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible re-rendering results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.

Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose estimation from reward for navigation alone. In a large study we investigate the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking, space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings, leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extend. We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.</p></details> |  |

Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets and algorithms approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered in the research field. In this work, we address this shortcoming by introducing: (1) Articulate3D, an expertly curated 3D dataset featuring high-quality manual annotations on 280 indoor scenes. Articulate3D provides 8 types of annotations for articulated objects, covering parts and detailed motion information, all stored in a standardized scene representation format designed for scalable 3D content creation, exchange and seamless integration into simulation environments. (2) USDNet, a novel unified framework capable of simultaneously predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes for articulated objects. We evaluate USDNet on Articulate3D as well as two existing datasets, demonstrating the advantage of our unified dense prediction approach. Furthermore, we highlight the value of Articulate3D through cross-dataset and cross-domain evaluations and showcase its applicability in downstream tasks such as scene editing through LLM prompting and robotic policy training for articulated object manipulation. We provide open access to our dataset, benchmark, and method's source code.</p></details> |  |

As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats, which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused, local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art.

Current language model-based navigation systems operate on discrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node connections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams into continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by DeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego dataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling to balance historical and current observations. While large language models can supervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level control. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with expert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced with a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights multi-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong performance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied navigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient, reward-driven post-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: vlnr1.github.io</p></details> |

While early efforts focused on 2D visual perception and simulation, recent 3D-aware generative world models have demonstrated the ability to synthesize geometrically consistent, interactive 3D environments, marking a shift toward 3D spatial cognition. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks systematic analysis to categorize emerging techniques and clarify their roles in advancing 3D cognitive world models. This survey addresses this need by introducing a conceptual framework, providing a structured and forward-looking review of world models transitioning from 2D perception to 3D cognition. Within this framework, we highlight two key technological drivers, particularly advances in 3D representations and the incorporation of world knowledge, as fundamental pillars. Building on these, we dissect three core cognitive capabilities that underpin 3D world modeling: 3D physical scene generation, 3D spatial reasoning, and 3D spatial interaction. We further examine the deployment of these capabilities in real-world applications, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, digital twin, and gaming/VR. Finally, we identify challenges across data, modeling, and deployment, and outline future directions for advancing more robust and generalizable 3D world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Multi-sensor Fusion Perception for Embodied AI: Background, Methods, Challenges and Prospects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19769v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-sensor fusion perception (MSFP) is a key technology for embodied AI, which can serve a variety of downstream tasks (e.g., 3D object detection and semantic segmentation) and application scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving and swarm robotics). Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion, while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods. A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

The recent rise of AI scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning, and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration, and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven science.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce InternSpatial, the largest open-source dataset for spatial reasoning in VLMs, along with InternSpatial-Bench, a corresponding evaluation benchmark designed to assess spatial understanding under diverse instruction formats. InternSpatial comprises 12 million QA pairs spanning both single-view and multi-view settings, drawn from diverse visual environments and supporting 19 instruction formats that reflect varied query styles. For evaluation, we propose InternSpatial-Bench for single-view tasks and expand multi-view reasoning by introducing a novel rotation angle prediction task that has not been explored in prior work. Experimental results show that models trained on InternSpatial achieve 12.1% improvement on InternSpatial-Bench and 10.7% on VSI-Bench, while maintaining strong performance on general-purpose benchmarks. We hope these resources will support the development of spatially capable VLMs in practical applications such as robotics and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, evaluating their rollouts remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable, semantics-aware evaluator for world models.</p></details> |  |

Through the use of sensors for input and actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges presented by real-world applications. To fill this gap and foster further development in the field, this paper reviews the current state of research, analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions, providing insights to guide innovation and progress in this field.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in simulation platforms have greatly enhanced task diversity to train embodied Vision Language Models (VLMs), most platforms rely on simplified robot morphologies and bypass the stochastic nature of low-level execution, which limits their transferability to real-world robots. To address these issues, we present a physics-based simulation platform DualTHOR for complex dual-arm humanoid robots, built upon an extended version of AI2-THOR. Our simulator includes real-world robot assets, a task suite for dual-arm collaboration, and inverse kinematics solvers for humanoid robots. We also introduce a contingency mechanism that incorporates potential failures through physics-based low-level execution, bridging the gap to real-world scenarios. Our simulator enables a more comprehensive evaluation of the robustness and generalization of VLMs in household environments. Extensive evaluations reveal that current VLMs struggle with dual-arm coordination and exhibit limited robustness in realistic environments with contingencies, highlighting the importance of using our simulator to develop more capable VLMs for embodied tasks.

Across diverse settings within Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality, introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

Despite the progress made by existing methods, these methods often present some common challenges. First, they rely on pre-trained backbone models for visual perception, which struggle with the dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios. Second, the performance is limited when using pre-trained LLMs or VLMs without fine-tuning, due to the absence of VLN domain knowledge. Third, while fine-tuning LLMs and VLMs can improve results, their computational costs are higher than those without fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning (WPCL), a method that enhances an agent's ability to identify objects from dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios by effectively integrating pre-trained VLM knowledge into the perception process, without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Our method enhances the agent's ability to interpret and respond to environmental cues while ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results have shown that our method outperforms the baseline methods on multiple benchmarks, which validate the effectiveness, robustness and generalizability of our method.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in robotic hardware and embodied AI have expanded their capabilities, current systems still struggle with handling thin, flat, and deformable objects such as paper and fabric. This limitation arises from the lack of suitable perception techniques for robust state estimation under diverse object appearances, as well as the absence of planning techniques for generating appropriate grasp motions. To bridge these gaps, this paper introduces PP-Tac, a robotic system for picking up paper-like objects. PP-Tac features a multi-fingered robotic hand with high-resolution omnidirectional tactile sensors \sensorname. This hardware configuration enables real-time slip detection and online frictional force control that mitigates such slips. Furthermore, grasp motion generation is achieved through a trajectory synthesis pipeline, which first constructs a dataset of finger's pinching motions. Based on this dataset, a diffusion-based policy is trained to control the hand-arm robotic system.

The diversity, realism, low cost accessibility and affordability of 3D data assets are critical for achieving generalization and scalability in embodied AI. However, most current embodied intelligence tasks still rely heavily on traditional 3D computer graphics assets manually created and annotated, which suffer from high production costs and limited realism. These limitations significantly hinder the scalability of data driven approaches. We present EmbodiedGen, a foundational platform for interactive 3D world generation. It enables the scalable generation of high-quality, controllable and photorealistic 3D assets with accurate physical properties and real-world scale in the Unified Robotics Description Format (URDF) at low cost. These assets can be directly imported into various physics simulation engines for fine-grained physical control, supporting downstream tasks in training and evaluation. EmbodiedGen is an easy-to-use, full-featured toolkit composed of six key modules: Image-to-3D, Text-to-3D, Texture Generation, Articulated Object Generation, Scene Generation and Layout Generation. EmbodiedGen generates diverse and interactive 3D worlds composed of generative 3D assets, leveraging generative AI to address the challenges of generalization and evaluation to the needs of embodied intelligence related research.

| **[Object-Centric Latent Action Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09680v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging vast amounts of unlabeled internet video data for embodied AI is currently bottlenecked by the lack of action labels and the presence of action-correlated visual distractors. Although recent latent action policy optimization (LAPO) has shown promise in inferring proxy-action labels from visual observations, its performance degrades significantly when distractors are present. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric latent action learning framework that centers on objects rather than pixels. We leverage self-supervised object-centric pretraining to disentangle action-related and distracting dynamics. This allows LAPO to focus on task-relevant interactions, resulting in more robust proxy-action labels, enabling better imitation learning and efficient adaptation of the agent with just a few action-labeled trajectories. We evaluated our method in eight visually complex tasks across the Distracting Control Suite (DCS) and Distracting MetaWorld (DMW). Our results show that object-centric pretraining mitigates the negative effects of distractors by 50%, as measured by downstream task performance: average return (DCS) and success rate (DMW).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Workshop on World Models at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Latent Action Learning Requires Supervision in the Presence of Distractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00379v5)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, latent action learning, pioneered by Latent Action Policies (LAPO), have shown remarkable pre-training efficiency on observation-only data, offering potential for leveraging vast amounts of video available on the web for embodied AI. However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025, Poster, Project Page: https://laom.dunnolab.ai/, Source code: https://github.com/dunnolab/laom</p></details> |
| **[A Navigation Framework Utilizing Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10172v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[OctoNav: Towards Generalist Embodied Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09839v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents, which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1. Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1, we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e., Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically, we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability. Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Analytic Task Scheduler: Recursive Least Squares Based Method for Continual Learning in Embodied Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09623v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied foundation models are crucial for Artificial Intelligence (AI) interacting with the physical world by integrating multi-modal inputs, such as proprioception, vision and language, to understand human intentions and generate actions to control robots. While these models demonstrate strong generalization and few-shot learning capabilities, they face significant challenges in continually acquiring new skills without forgetting previously learned skills, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose the Analytic Task Scheduler (ATS), a novel framework for continual learning in embodied foundation models. ATS consists of a task-specific model library, where each model is fine-tuned independently on a single task, and an analytic scheduler trained using recursive least squares (RLS) to learn the mapping between language instructions and task-specific models. This architecture enables accurate task recognition and dynamic model selection while fundamentally avoiding parameter interference across tasks. The scheduler updates its parameters incrementally using only statistics (autocorrelation and cross-correlation matrices), enabling forgetting-resistant learning without the need to revisit historical data. We validate ATS on a real-world robot platform (RM65B), demonstrating superior resistance to forgetting and strong adaptability to task variations. The results highlight ATS as an effective, scalable, and deployable solution for continual learning in embodied foundation models operating in complex, dynamic environments. Our code will be available at https://github.com/MIAA-Embodied-AI/AnalyticTaskScheduler</p></details> |  |
| **[What Can RL Bring to VLA Generalization? An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://faceong.github.io/VIKI-R/</p></details> |

Understanding their kinematic structure and reconstructing them have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. However, current methods require carefully captured data for training or inference, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable reconstruction of articulated objects. We focus on reconstruction of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to acquire at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is quite challenging, as the object and camera move simultaneously and there are significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a 20$\times$ larger synthetic dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories. We compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Experiments show that our method can reconstruct synthetic and real articulated objects across different categories from dynamic RGBD videos, outperforming existing methods significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website can be found at https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/video2articulation/</p></details> |

| **[Hierarchical Decision-Making for Autonomous Navigation: Integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning and Fuzzy Logic in Four-Wheel Independent Steering and Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16574v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a hierarchical decision-making framework for autonomous navigation in four-wheel independent steering and driving (4WISD) systems. The proposed approach integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for high-level navigation with fuzzy logic for low-level control to ensure both task performance and physical feasibility. The DRL agent generates global motion commands, while the fuzzy logic controller enforces kinematic constraints to prevent mechanical strain and wheel slippage. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms traditional navigation methods, offering enhanced training efficiency and stability and mitigating erratic behaviors compared to purely DRL-based solutions. Real-world validations further confirm the framework's ability to navigate safely and effectively in dynamic industrial settings. Overall, this work provides a scalable and reliable solution for deploying 4WISD mobile robots in complex, real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game and new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape model representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can restore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to 15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and a clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2) Direction shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value magnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and smallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and shallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top 20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4) Stronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones resist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD performance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than finding new solutions. Our spectrum-aware analysis highlights inexpensive recovery knobs low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets that practitioners can use before costly RL fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple "Try Again" Can Elicit Multi-Turn LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14295v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-turn problem solving is critical yet challenging for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to reflect on their reasoning and revise from feedback. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a single-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models trained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems across multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual feedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect their answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training models with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., "Let's try again") after wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn reasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement learning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative problem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training setups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn performance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling language models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To further minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while encouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures that guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn.

| **[Guiding Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning for Stable Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16521v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating physically realistic 3D molecular structures remains a core challenge in molecular generative modeling. While diffusion models equipped with equivariant neural networks have made progress in capturing molecular geometries, they often struggle to produce equilibrium structures that adhere to physical principles such as force field consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework that extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular generation. RLPF formulates the task as a Markov decision process and applies proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models. Crucially, RLPF introduces reward functions derived from force-field evaluations, providing direct physical feedback to guide the generation toward energetically stable and physically meaningful structures. Experiments on the QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets demonstrate that RLPF significantly improves molecular stability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the value of incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling. The code is available at: https://github.com/ZhijianZhou/RLPF/tree/verl_diffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16496v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general, human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply, these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.</p></details> | PhD thesis |
| **[Multi-agent Robust and Optimal Policy Learning for Data Harvesting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16490v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of using multiple agents to harvest data from a collection of sensor nodes (targets) scattered across a two-dimensional environment. These targets transmit their data to the agents that move in the space above them, and our goal is for the agents to collect data from the targets as efficiently as possible while moving to their final destinations. The agents are assumed to have a continuous control action, and we leverage reinforcement learning, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Lagrangian Penalty (LP), to identify highly effective solutions. Additionally, we enhance the controller's robustness by incorporating regularization at each state to smooth the learned policy. We conduct a series of simulations to demonstrate our approach and validate its performance and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning-based Control via Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16474v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs). YANNs provide an interpretable neural network which can exactly represent known piecewise affine functions of arbitrary input and output dimensions defined on any amount of polytopic subdomains. One representative application of YANNs is to reformulate explicit solutions of multi-parametric linear model predictive control. Built on this, we propose the use of YANNs to initialize RL actor and critic networks, which enables the resulting YANN-RL control algorithm to start with the confidence of linear optimal control. The YANN-actor is initialized by representing the multi-parametric control solutions obtained via offline computation using an approximated linear system model. The YANN-critic represents the explicit form of the state-action value function for the linear system and the reward function as the objective in an optimal control problem (OCP). Additional network layers are injected to extend YANNs for nonlinear expressions, which can be trained online by directly interacting with the true complex nonlinear system. In this way, both the policy and state-value functions exactly represent a linear OCP initially and are able to eventually learn the solution of a general nonlinear OCP. Continuous policy improvement is also implemented to provide heuristic confidence that the linear OCP solution serves as an effective lower bound to the performance of RL policy. The YANN-RL algorithm is demonstrated on a clipped pendulum and a safety-critical chemical-reactive system. Our results show that YANN-RL significantly outperforms the modern RL algorithm using deep deterministic policy gradient, especially when considering safety constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Your Reward Function for RL is Your Best PRM for Search: Unifying RL and Search-Based TTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14313v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model, matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms, our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data. These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex reasoning tasks in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, UAM faces critical operational challenges, particularly the balance between minimizing noise exposure and maintaining safe separation in low-altitude urban airspace, two objectives that are often addressed separately. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based air traffic management system that integrates both noise and safety considerations within a unified, decentralized framework. Under this scalable air traffic coordination solution, agents operate in a structured, multi-layered airspace and learn altitude adjustment policies to jointly manage noise impact and separation constraints. The system demonstrates strong performance across both objectives and reveals tradeoffs among separation, noise exposure, and energy efficiency under high traffic density. The findings highlight the potential of RL and multi-objective coordination strategies in enhancing the safety, quietness, and efficiency of UAM operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[OPERA: A Reinforcement Learning--Enhanced Orchestrated Planner-Executor Architecture for Reasoning-Oriented Multi-Hop Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16438v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and dense retrievers have driven significant progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, existing approaches face significant challenges in complex reasoning-oriented multi-hop retrieval tasks: 1) Ineffective reasoning-oriented planning: Prior methods struggle to generate robust multi-step plans for complex queries, as rule-based decomposers perform poorly on out-of-template questions. 2) Suboptimal reasoning-driven retrieval: Related methods employ limited query reformulation, leading to iterative retrieval loops that often fail to locate golden documents. 3) Insufficient reasoning-guided filtering: Prevailing methods lack the fine-grained reasoning to effectively filter salient information from noisy results, hindering utilization of retrieved knowledge. Fundamentally, these limitations all stem from the weak coupling between retrieval and reasoning in current RAG architectures. We introduce the Orchestrated Planner-Executor Reasoning Architecture (OPERA), a novel reasoning-driven retrieval framework. OPERA's Goal Planning Module (GPM) decomposes questions into sub-goals, which are executed by a Reason-Execute Module (REM) with specialized components for precise reasoning and effective retrieval. To train OPERA, we propose Multi-Agents Progressive Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAPGRPO), a novel variant of GRPO. Experiments on complex multi-hop benchmarks show OPERA's superior performance, validating both the MAPGRPO method and OPERA's design. Code is available at https://github.com/Ameame1/OPERA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Double Check My Desired Return: Transformer with Target Alignment for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16420v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task, enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target alignment for Offline RL. Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within and beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over policy performance. Notably, on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark, EpiCare, our approach effectively modulates treatment policy aggressiveness, balancing therapeutic returns against adverse event risk.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Bridging the Reward-Generation Gap in Direct Alignment Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09457v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO), have emerged as efficient alternatives to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) algorithms for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, DAAs suffer from a fundamental limitation we identify as the "reward-generation gap" -- a misalignment between optimization objectives during training and actual generation performance during inference. In this paper, we find a contributor to the reward-generation gap is the mismatch between the inherent importance of prefix tokens during the LLM generation process and how this importance is reflected in the implicit reward functions of DAAs. To bridge the gap, we adopt a token-level MDP perspective of DAAs to analyze its limitations and introduce a simple yet effective approach called Prefix-Oriented Equal-length Training (POET), which truncates both preferred and dispreferred responses to match the shorter one's length. Training with \mname, where both responses in each sample are truncated to equal length, resulting in diverse truncated lengths across samples, the optimization of DAAs objective is implicitly constrained to converge across all timesteps of token-level MDP, thus paying more attention to prefix tokens than the standard DAAs. We conduct experiments with DPO and SimPO, two representative DAAs, demonstrating that POET improves over their standard implementations, achieving up to 15.6 points in AlpacaEval 2 and overall improvements across downstream tasks. Our results highlight the importance of addressing the misalignment between reward optimization and generation performance in DAAs.</p></details> |  |
| **[OwkinZero: Accelerating Biological Discovery with AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16315v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing scientific research, they continue to struggle with core biological reasoning tasks essential for translational and biomedical discovery. To address this limitation, we created and curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000 verifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in drug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug perturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by post-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero models substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on these biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently outperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were trained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task improvements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable performance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological discovery.</p></details> | Preprint |

To fully leverage the advantages of collaborative edge computing, joint optimization of service deployment and task scheduling is necessary. Existing optimization methods insufficiently address the collaboration across spatial and temporal dimensions, which hinders their adaptability to the spatiotemporally varying nature of user demands and system states. This paper focuses on optimizing the expected task processing delay in edge networks. We propose a two-timescale online optimization framework to jointly determine: i) service deployment decisions at each large timescale; and ii) task scheduling decisions at each small timescale. Specifically, the convex optimization technique is used to solve the task scheduling problem, while a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning technique is employed for the service deployment problem. These two methods are combined for spatiotemporal co-optimization through a two-timescale alternating optimization approach. Compared to the baseline algorithms, the proposed scheme achieves better delay performance, while also exhibiting low running time and favorable convergence behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by IEEE Globecom 2025</p></details> |
| **[Representation Learning of Auxiliary Concepts for Improved Student Modeling and Exercise Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16269v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems, typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing (KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete, error-prone, or overly general. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep learning KT architectures. We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes within a simulated student environment.</p></details> |  |

With the development of Large Reasoning Models, many studies have demonstrated that step-by-step reasoning during test-time helps improve listwise ranking performance. However, due to the scarcity of reasoning-intensive training data, existing rerankers perform poorly in many complex ranking scenarios and the ranking ability of reasoning-intensive rerankers remains largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we first propose an automated reasoning-intensive training data synthesis framework, which sources training queries and passages from diverse domains and applies DeepSeek-R1 to generate high-quality training labels. A self-consistency data filtering mechanism is designed to ensure the data quality. To empower the listwise reranker with strong reasoning ability, we further propose a two-stage post-training approach, which includes a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage for reasoning pattern learning and a reinforcement learning (RL) stage for further ranking ability enhancement. During the RL stage, based on the nature of listwise ranking, we design a multi-view ranking reward, which is more effective than a ranking metric-based reward. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our trained reasoning-intensive reranker \textbf{ReasonRank} outperforms existing baselines significantly and also achieves much lower latency than pointwise reranker Rank1. \textbf{Through further experiments, our ReasonRank has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance 40.6 on the BRIGHT leaderboard\footnote{https://brightbenchmark.github.io/}.} Our codes are available at https://github.com/8421BCD/ReasonRank.</p></details> | 21 pages |

We formulate an entropy-regularized exploratory control problem with stochastic policies to capture the exploration--exploitation balance essential for RL. Unlike the pure diffusion case initially studied by Wang et al. (2020), the derivation of the exploratory dynamics under jump-diffusions calls for a careful formulation of the jump part. Through a theoretical analysis, we find that one can simply use the same policy evaluation and $q$-learning algorithms in Jia and Zhou (2022a, 2023), originally developed for controlled diffusions, without needing to check a priori whether the underlying data come from a pure diffusion or a jump-diffusion. However, we show that the presence of jumps ought to affect parameterizations of actors and critics in general. We investigate as an application the mean--variance portfolio selection problem with stock price modelled as a jump-diffusion, and show that both RL algorithms and parameterizations are invariant with respect to jumps. Finally, we present a detailed study on applying the general theory to option hedging.</p></details> |  |

To handle the challenges arising from dynamic low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite topologies and heterogeneous content demands, we propose a learning-based framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The satellite network is represented as a dynamic graph, where GNNs are embedded within the DRL agent to capture spatial and topological dependencies and support routing-aware decision-making. The caching strategy is optimized by formulating the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and applying soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the delivery success rate and reduces communication traffic cost.</p></details> | 5 pages, 6 figures |
| **[AgentFly: Fine-tuning LLM Agents without Fine-tuning LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16153v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static, handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning. We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP), equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches $66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to $9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios.

| **[Bayesian-Driven Graph Reasoning for Active Radio Map Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09142v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of the low-altitude economy, radio maps have become essential for ensuring reliable wireless connectivity to aerial platforms. Autonomous aerial agents are commonly deployed for data collection using waypoint-based navigation; however, their limited battery capacity significantly constrains coverage and efficiency. To address this, we propose an uncertainty-aware radio map (URAM) reconstruction framework that explicitly leverages graph-based reasoning tailored for waypoint navigation. Our approach integrates two key deep learning components: (1) a Bayesian neural network that estimates spatial uncertainty in real time, and (2) an attention-based reinforcement learning policy that performs global reasoning over a probabilistic roadmap, using uncertainty estimates to plan informative and energy-efficient trajectories. This graph-based reasoning enables intelligent, non-myopic trajectory planning, guiding agents toward the most informative regions while satisfying safety constraints. Experimental results show that URAM improves reconstruction accuracy by up to 34% over existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging the Gap in Ophthalmic AI: MM-Retinal-Reason Dataset and OphthaReason Model toward Dynamic Multimodal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16129v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities with reinforcement learning paradigm. Although several multimodal reasoning models have been explored in the medical domain, most of them focus exclusively on basic reasoning, which refers to shallow inference based on visual feature matching. However, real-world clinical diagnosis extends beyond basic reasoning, demanding reasoning processes that integrate heterogeneous clinical information (such as chief complaints and medical history) with multimodal medical imaging data. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Retinal-Reason, the first ophthalmic multimodal dataset with the full spectrum of perception and reasoning. It encompasses both basic reasoning tasks and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance visual-centric fundamental reasoning capabilities and emulate realistic clinical thinking patterns. Building upon MM-Retinal-Reason, we propose OphthaReason, the first ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning traces. To enable flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning tasks, we specifically design a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Thinking (UADT), which estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and dynamically modulates the model's exploration depth using a shaped advantage mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks, outperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and ophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92\%, 15.00\%, 21.20\%, and 17.66\%.

| **[Efficient RL Training for Reasoning Models via Length-Aware Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12284v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 or DeepSeek R1, have demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning tasks but often incur a long reasoning path with significant memory and time costs. Existing methods primarily aim to shorten reasoning paths by introducing additional training data and stages. In this paper, we propose three critical reward designs integrated directly into the reinforcement learning process of large reasoning models, which reduce the response length without extra training stages. Experiments on four settings show that our method significantly decreases response length while maintaining or even improving performance. Specifically, in a logic reasoning setting, we achieve a 40% reduction in response length averaged by steps alongside a 14% gain in performance. For math problems, we reduce response length averaged by steps by 33% while preserving performance.</p></details> | Under review |

It is the core challenge for robotic deployments in large-scale logistics and transportation. Decentralized learning-based approaches have shown great potential for addressing the MAPF problems, offering more reactive and scalable solutions. However, existing learning-based MAPF methods usually rely on agents making decisions based on a limited field of view (FOV), resulting in short-sighted policies and inefficient cooperation in complex scenarios. There, a critical challenge is to achieve consensus on potential movements between agents based on limited observations and communications. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new framework that applies sheaf theory to decentralized deep reinforcement learning, enabling agents to learn geometric cross-dependencies between each other through local consensus and utilize them for tightly cooperative decision-making. In particular, sheaf theory provides a mathematical proof of conditions for achieving global consensus through local observation. Inspired by this, we incorporate a neural network to approximately model the consensus in latent space based on sheaf theory and train it through self-supervised learning. During the task, in addition to normal features for MAPF as in previous works, each agent distributedly reasons about a learned consensus feature, leading to efficient cooperation on pathfinding and collision avoidance. As a result, our proposed method demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art learning-based MAPF planners, especially in relatively large and complex scenarios, demonstrating its superiority over baselines in various simulations and real-world robot experiments.

Traditional heuristics employed for storage performance optimization often fail to adapt to the variability and complexity of contemporary workloads, leading to significant performance bottlenecks and resource inefficiencies. To address these challenges, this paper introduces RL-Storage, a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework designed to dynamically optimize storage system configurations. RL-Storage leverages deep Q-learning algorithms to continuously learn from real-time I/O patterns and predict optimal storage parameters, such as cache size, queue depths, and readahead settings[1].This work underscores the transformative potential of reinforcement learning techniques in addressing the dynamic nature of modern storage systems. By autonomously adapting to workload variations in real time, RL-Storage provides a robust and scalable solution for optimizing storage performance, paving the way for next-generation intelligent storage infrastructures.</p></details> |  |

Yet, proactive engagement, prioritizing resource optimization with planning and assessment capabilities, is often overlooked in current ITS designs. In this work, we investigate a new task, named Goal-oriented Intelligent Tutoring Systems (GITS), which aims to enable the student's mastery of a designated concept by strategically planning a customized sequence of exercises and assessment. To address the problem of goal-oriented policy learning in GITS, we propose a novel graph-based reinforcement learning framework, named Planning-Assessment-Interaction (PAI). Specifically, we first leverage cognitive structure information to improve state representation learning and action selection for planning the next action, which can be either to tutor an exercise or to assess the target concept. Further, we use a dynamically updated cognitive diagnosis model to simulate student responses to exercises and concepts. Three benchmark datasets across different subjects are constructed for enabling offline academic research on GITS. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of PAI and extensive analyses of various types of students are conducted to showcase the challenges in this task.</p></details> | Accepted by ACM TOIS |
| **[Balancing Act: Prioritization Strategies for LLM-Designed Restless Bandit Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12112v5)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly used to design reward functions based on human preferences in Reinforcement Learning (RL). We focus on LLM-designed rewards for Restless Multi-Armed Bandits, a framework for allocating limited resources among agents. In applications such as public health, this approach empowers grassroots health workers to tailor automated allocation decisions to community needs. In the presence of multiple agents, altering the reward function based on human preferences can impact subpopulations very differently, leading to complex tradeoffs and a multi-objective resource allocation problem. We are the first to present a principled method termed Social Choice Language Model for dealing with these tradeoffs for LLM-designed rewards for multiagent planners in general and restless bandits in particular. The novel part of our model is a transparent and configurable selection component, called an adjudicator, external to the LLM that controls complex tradeoffs via a user-selected social welfare function. Our experiments demonstrate that our model reliably selects more effective, aligned, and balanced reward functions compared to purely LLM-based approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pareto Actor-Critic for Communication and Computation Co-Optimization in Non-Cooperative Federated Learning Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16037v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL, a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic (PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2% improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively, over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.</p></details> |  |

While their ability to perform reinforcement learning in-context has been established both theoretically and empirically, their behavior in non-stationary environments remains less understood. In this study, we address this gap by showing that transformers can achieve nearly optimal dynamic regret bounds in non-stationary settings. We prove that transformers are capable of approximating strategies used to handle non-stationary environments and can learn the approximator in the in-context learning setup. Our experiments further show that transformers can match or even outperform existing expert algorithms in such environments.</p></details> | 28 pages |

This paper presents an AI-driven framework that automates test case generation and validation using natural language processing (NLP), reinforcement learning (RL), and predictive models, embedded within a policy-driven trust and fairness model. The approach translates natural language requirements into executable tests, continuously optimizes them through learning, and validates outcomes with real-time analysis while mitigating bias. Case studies demonstrate measurable gains in defect detection, reduced testing effort, and faster release cycles, showing that AI-enhanced testing improves both efficiency and reliability. By addressing integration and scalability challenges, the framework illustrates how AI can shift testing from a reactive, manual process to a proactive, adaptive system that strengthens software quality in increasingly complex environments.</p></details> | 10 Pages |

However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that enables efficient per-step annotation by jointly aligning solution steps to reference solutions and determine its accuracy with explicit reasoning in single generation. We demonstrate SPARE's effectiveness across four diverse datasets spanning mathematical reasoning (GSM8K, MATH), multi-hop question answering (MuSiQue-Ans), and spatial reasoning (SpaRP), showing consistent improvements in two applications: (1) training Process Reward Models (PRMs) for ranking and aggregating multiple generations, and (2) fine-tuning models via offline reinforcement learning for greedy decoding. On ProcessBench, SPARE demonstrates data-efficient out-of-distribution generalization, using only $\sim$16% of training samples compared to human-labeled and other synthetically trained baselines. Additionally, it achieves competitive performance with MCTS-based methods while offering 2.3$\times$ speedup in terms of total token count. Manual analysis reveals complementary precision-recall characteristics with MCTS approaches, suggesting potential for ensemble methods. These results establish SPARE as a practical and scalable solution for automatic process supervision in LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages main content, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Most works in this area use a discrete-time formulation, which is prone to induced discretization errors, and often not applicable to models with higher-order/black-box solvers. The objective of this study is to develop a disciplined approach to fine-tune diffusion models using continuous-time RL, formulated as a stochastic control problem with a reward function that aligns the end result (terminal state) with input prompt. The key idea is to treat score matching as controls or actions, and thereby making connections to policy optimization and regularization in continuous-time RL. To carry out this idea, we lay out a new policy optimization framework for continuous-time RL, and illustrate its potential in enhancing the value networks design space via leveraging the structural property of diffusion models. We validate the advantages of our method by experiments in downstream tasks of fine-tuning large-scale Text2Image models of Stable Diffusion v1.5.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.08400</p></details> |
| **[Partially Decentralized Multi-Agent Q-Learning via Digital Cousins for Wireless Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05970v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Q-learning is a widely used reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for optimizing wireless networks, but faces challenges with large state-spaces. Recently proposed multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ) algorithm addresses these challenges by employing multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple synthetically generated, distinct but structurally related environments, so-called digital cousins. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ (M-MEMQ) for cooperative decentralized wireless networks with multiple networked transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs). TXs do not have access to global information (joint state and actions). The new concept of coordinated and uncoordinated states is introduced. In uncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs and update local Q-functions. In coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state and update the joint Q-functions. The cost of information-sharing scales linearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. Several theoretical guarantees, including deterministic and probabilistic convergence, bounds on estimation error variance, and the probability of misdetecting the joint states, are given. Numerical simulations show that M-MEMQ outperforms several decentralized and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent RL algorithms by achieving 60% lower average policy error (APE), 40% faster convergence, 45% reduced runtime complexity, and 40% less sample complexity. Furthermore, M-MEMQ achieves comparable APE with significantly lower complexity than centralized methods. Simulations validate the theoretical analyses.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This treatment involves patients observing virtual spiders in order to become desensitized and decrease their phobia, which requires that the spiders elicit specific anxiety responses. However, VRET approaches tend to require therapists to hand-select the appropriate spider for each patient, which is a time-consuming process and takes significant technical knowledge and patient insight. While automated methods exist, they tend to employ rules-based approaches with minimal ability to adapt to specific users. To address these challenges, we present a framework for VRET utilizing procedural content generation (PCG) and reinforcement learning (RL), which automatically adapts a spider to elicit a desired anxiety response. We demonstrate the superior performance of this system compared to a more common rules-based VRET method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS).

Many attempts employ supervised or reinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods. However, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not competitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization between metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the latent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For such, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a hierarchical graph visualization problem. There is limited literature on methods for this problem, for which Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP) heuristics have shown promising results. In line with this, this paper investigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of GRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational experiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node embedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out. The evaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of the solutions according to the required time for such. According to this measure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than state-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem. A scalability test on newly generated denser instances under a fixed time limit further confirmed the robustness of the GL-GRASP heuristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted for publication in the European Journal of Operational Research.

Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have further improved performance in System-2 reasoning domains like mathematics and programming by harnessing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, while longer CoT reasoning sequences improve performance, they also introduce significant computational overhead due to verbose and redundant outputs, known as the "overthinking phenomenon". In this paper, we provide the first structured survey to systematically investigate and explore the current progress toward achieving efficient reasoning in LLMs. Overall, relying on the inherent mechanism of LLMs, we categorize existing works into several key directions: (1) model-based efficient reasoning, which considers optimizing full-length reasoning models into more concise reasoning models or directly training efficient reasoning models; (2) reasoning output-based efficient reasoning, which aims to dynamically reduce reasoning steps and length during inference; (3) input prompts-based efficient reasoning, which seeks to enhance reasoning efficiency based on input prompt properties such as difficulty or length control. Additionally, we introduce the use of efficient data for training reasoning models, explore the reasoning capabilities of small language models, and discuss evaluation methods and benchmarking.

While general-purpose deep research agents have shown impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored for medical contexts. We present a medical deep research agent that addresses these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool interactions. Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we investigate their capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity. Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability. Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems. Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to half, resulting in approximately 75% lower inference compute.

We propose a decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all evaluated environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ECAI 2025</p></details> |

However, in high-value but more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters, continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic stabilities for crystals.

Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help, but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from large-scale data through RL. Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

This paper demystifies reward function design by systematically analyzing the impact of effort minimization, task completion bonuses, and target proximity incentives on typical HCI tasks such as pointing, tracking, and choice reaction. We show that proximity incentives are essential for guiding movement, while completion bonuses ensure task success. Effort terms, though optional, help refine motion regularity when appropriately scaled. We perform an extensive analysis of how sensitive task success and completion time depend on the weights of these three reward components. From these results we derive practical guidelines to create plausible biomechanical simulations without the need for reinforcement learning expertise, which we then validate on remote control and keyboard typing tasks. This paper advances simulation-based interaction design and evaluation in HCI by improving the efficiency and applicability of biomechanical user modeling for real-world interface development.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 14 figures, 1 table, ACM UIST 2025</p></details> |

NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be transformed into an online interface, supporting both single-agent and multi-agent environments. As such, NiceWebRL enables AI researchers to compare their algorithms to human performance, cognitive scientists to test ML algorithms as theories for human cognition, and multi-agent researchers to develop algorithms for human-AI collaboration. We showcase NiceWebRL with 3 case studies that demonstrate its potential to help develop Human-like AI, Human-compatible AI, and Human-assistive AI. In the first case study (Human-like AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel RL model of cognition. Here, NiceWebRL facilitates testing this model against human participants in both a grid world and Craftax, a 2D Minecraft domain. In our second case study (Human-compatible AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel multi-agent RL algorithm that can generalize to human partners in the Overcooked domain. Finally, in our third case study (Human-assistive AI), we show how NiceWebRL can allow researchers to study how an LLM can assist humans on complex tasks in XLand-Minigrid, an environment with millions of hierarchical tasks.

| **[Pairwise or Pointwise? Evaluating Feedback Protocols for Bias in LLM-Based Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14716v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as proxies for human labelers in both training (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback) and large-scale response evaluation (LLM-as-a-judge). Alignment and evaluation are critical components in the development of reliable LLMs, and the choice of feedback protocol plays a central role in both but remains understudied. In this work, we show that the choice of feedback protocol for evaluation (absolute scores versus relative preferences) can significantly affect evaluation reliability and induce systematic biases. In the context of LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, we show that pairwise protocols are more vulnerable to distracted evaluation. Generator models can exploit spurious attributes (or distractor features) favored by the LLM judge, resulting in inflated scores for lower-quality outputs. We find that absolute scoring is more robust to such manipulation, producing judgments that better reflect response quality and are less influenced by distractor features. Our results demonstrate that generator models can flip preferences by embedding distractor features, skewing LLM-as-a-judge comparisons and leading to inaccurate conclusions about model quality in benchmark evaluations. Pairwise preferences flip in about 35% of the cases, compared to only 9% for absolute scores. We offer recommendations for choosing feedback protocols based on dataset characteristics and evaluation objectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Understanding Action Effects through Instrumental Empowerment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15652v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment. Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances explainability in MARL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Europ...</summary><p>European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI) 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks. By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025, 15 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Dynamical Systems Framework for Reinforcement Learning Safety and Robustness Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15588v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty. Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that appear successful based on reward alone.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Seed-X, a family of open-source LLMs comprising instruct and reasoning models, pushing the limits of translation capability with 7B parameter size. The base model is pre-trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset encompassing both monolingual and bilingual content across 28 languages, harnessing the full potential of multilingual data. The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs. Seed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models, including Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly outperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We share the best practices through our optimization process, and make the parameter public available for advancing translation research and applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Think in Blocks: Adaptive Reasoning from Direct Response to Deep Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15507v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReconDreamer-RL: Enhancing Reinforcement Learning via Diffusion-based Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08170v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning for training end-to-end autonomous driving models in closed-loop simulations is gaining growing attention. However, most simulation environments differ significantly from real-world conditions, creating a substantial simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap. To bridge this gap, some approaches utilize scene reconstruction techniques to create photorealistic environments as a simulator. While this improves realistic sensor simulation, these methods are inherently constrained by the distribution of the training data, making it difficult to render high-quality sensor data for novel trajectories or corner case scenarios. Therefore, we propose ReconDreamer-RL, a framework designed to integrate video diffusion priors into scene reconstruction to aid reinforcement learning, thereby enhancing end-to-end autonomous driving training. Specifically, in ReconDreamer-RL, we introduce ReconSimulator, which combines the video diffusion prior for appearance modeling and incorporates a kinematic model for physical modeling, thereby reconstructing driving scenarios from real-world data. This narrows the sim2real gap for closed-loop evaluation and reinforcement learning. To cover more corner-case scenarios, we introduce the Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA), which adjusts the trajectories of surrounding vehicles relative to the ego vehicle, autonomously generating corner-case traffic scenarios (e.g., cut-in). Finally, the Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) is proposed to address the issue of training data distribution, which is often biased toward simple straight-line movements. Experiments show that ReconDreamer-RL improves end-to-end autonomous driving training, outperforming imitation learning methods with a 5x reduction in the Collision Ratio.</p></details> |  |

We leverage large language models (LLMs) to interpret the input instructions into detailed execution plans. Unlike prior work, our system is capable of generating detailed finger-object interactions, in seamless coordination with full-body movements. We also train a policy to track generated motions in physics simulation via reinforcement learning (RL) to ensure physical plausibility of the motion. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in synthesizing realistic interactions with diverse objects in complex environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, project page: https://hoifhli.github.io/</p></details> |

Existing theories and models have been developed to explain and predict these diverse patterns. While users often experience uncomfortable sensations, such as cybersickness, during virtual reality (VR) use, they do not always make optimal decisions to mitigate these effects. Although methods like reinforcement learning have been used to model decision-making processes, they typically rely on random selection to simulate actions, failing to capture the complexities of real navigation behavior. In this study, we propose curiosity as a key factor driving irrational decision-making, suggesting that users continuously balance exploration and cybersickness according to the free energy principle during virtual navigation. Our findings show that VR users generally adopt conservative strategies when navigating, with most participants displaying negative curiosity across trials. However, curiosity levels tend to rise when the virtual environment changes, illustrating the dynamic interplay between exploration and discomfort. This study provides a quantitative approach to decoding curiosity-driven behavior during virtual navigation, offering insights into how users balance exploration and the avoidance of cybersickness. Future research will further refine this model by incorporating additional psychological and environmental factors to improve the accuracy of navigation pattern predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, submitted to the IEEE</p></details> |

However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast, preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved. In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, under review</p></details> |

Distributing samples across nodes usually yields the best performance, but poses scaling challenges due to global information dissemination and load imbalance across uneven sample lengths. State-of-the-art decentralized optimizers mitigate the problem, but require more iterations to achieve the same accuracy as their globally-communicating counterparts. We present Wait-Avoiding Group Model Averaging (WAGMA) SGD, a wait-avoiding stochastic optimizer that reduces global communication via subgroup weight exchange. The key insight is a combination of algorithmic changes to the averaging scheme and the use of a group allreduce operation. We prove the convergence of WAGMA-SGD, and empirically show that it retains convergence rates similar to Allreduce-SGD. For evaluation, we train ResNet-50 on ImageNet; Transformer for machine translation; and deep reinforcement learning for navigation at scale. Compared with state-of-the-art decentralized SGD variants, WAGMA-SGD significantly improves training throughput (e.g., 2.1x on 1,024 GPUs for reinforcement learning), and achieves the fastest time-to-solution (e.g., the highest score using the shortest training time for Transformer).</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (IEEE TPDS), vol. 32, no. 7, pp. 1725-1739, 1 July 2021, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2020.3040606</p></details> |

Reliable Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication is critical to achieving efficient cooperative control. However, in the real-world traffic environment, V2V communication may suffer from time-varying delay and packet loss, leading to degraded control performance and even safety risks. To mitigate the adverse effects of non-ideal communication, this paper proposes a Dynamic Communication Topology based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (DCT-MARL) algorithm for robust cooperative platoon control. Specifically, the state space is augmented with historical control action and delay to enhance robustness against communication delay. To mitigate the impact of packet loss, a multi-key gated communication mechanism is introduced, which dynamically adjusts the communication topology based on the correlation between vehicles and their current communication status. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DCT-MARL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of string stability and driving comfort, validating its superior robustness and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM}, a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i) selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time. Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning.

However, our investigation reveals that the MISO architecture exhibits fundamental limitations in "Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output" (MIMO) (e.g., parallel multi-tasks output processing): the architecture generates task mutual exclusion effects, leading to resource contention among different tasks when sharing output channels, and consequently resulting in optimization imbalance and performance degradation. In contrast, human MIMO processing inherently enables concurrent task execution (e.g., while dialogue and decision-making) without interference. Inspired by this, in this work, we propose a unified MIMO training model with parallel multi-tasks output capabilities termed Visual Language Action Model for Simultaneously Chatting and Decision Making. We refer to this method as VLASCD or MIMO-VLA, and in the following, we will use these two names interchangeably. We evaluate the model on the CARLA autonomous driving platform. The results show that, compared to LLM models with MISO dialogue capabilities, reinforcement learning models, and VLA models with MISO decision-making capabilities, MIMO-VLA significantly outperforms existing MISO models in simultaneously handling dialogue generation and decision-making tasks within the MIMO scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely employed for automated scheduling policy design. However, the performance of DRL is heavily influenced by the design of the problem-tailored policy network and is highly sensitive to hyperparameters and the design of reward feedback. Considering the above-mentioned issues, this study proposes a novel DRL method combining Graph Attention Networks-based policy network and Evolution Strategy, referred to as GATES. The contributions of GATES are summarized as follows: (1) GATES can capture the impact of current task scheduling on subsequent tasks by learning the topological relationships between tasks in a DAG. (2) GATES can assess the importance of each VM to the ready task, enabling it to adapt to dynamically changing VM resources. (3) Utilizing Evolution Strategy's robustness, exploratory nature, and tolerance for delayed rewards, GATES achieves stable policy learning in CADWS. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GATES in CADWS, outperforming several state-of-the-art algorithms.

To enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First, vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second, existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations. Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%).

In the first half of the paper, we review the basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL, showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras, extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action) value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.</p></details> | 45 pages |
| **[One Subgoal at a Time: Zero-Shot Generalization to Arbitrary Linear Temporal Logic Requirements in Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01561v3)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizing to complex and temporally extended task objectives and safety constraints remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Linear temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements, yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mirror Descent for Stochastic Control Problems with Measure-valued Controls](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01198v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the convergence of the mirror descent algorithm for finite horizon stochastic control problems with measure-valued control processes. The control objective involves a convex regularisation function, denoted as $h$, with regularisation strength determined by the weight $\tau\ge 0$. The setting covers regularised relaxed control problems. Under suitable conditions, we establish the relative smoothness and convexity of the control objective with respect to the Bregman divergence of $h$, and prove linear convergence of the algorithm for $\tau=0$ and exponential convergence for $\tau>0$. The results apply to common regularisers including relative entropy, $\chi^2$-divergence, and entropic Wasserstein costs. This validates recent reinforcement learning heuristics that adding regularisation accelerates the convergence of gradient methods. The proof exploits careful regularity estimates of backward stochastic differential equations in the bounded mean oscillation norm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deceptive Sequential Decision-Making via Regularized Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18803v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems are increasingly expected to operate in the presence of adversaries, though adversaries may infer sensitive information simply by observing a system. Therefore, present a deceptive sequential decision-making framework that not only conceals sensitive information, but actively misleads adversaries about it. We model autonomous systems as Markov decision processes, with adversaries using inverse reinforcement learning to recover reward functions. To counter them, we present three regularization strategies for policy synthesis problems that actively deceive an adversary about a system's reward. ``Diversionary deception'' leads an adversary to draw any false conclusion about the system's reward function. ``Targeted deception'' leads an adversary to draw a specific false conclusion about the system's reward function. ``Equivocal deception'' leads an adversary to infer that the real reward and a false reward both explain the system's behavior. We show how each form of deception can be implemented in policy optimization problems and analytically bound the loss in total accumulated reward induced by deception. Next, we evaluate these developments in a multi-agent setting. We show that diversionary, targeted, and equivocal deception all steer the adversary to false beliefs while still attaining a total accumulated reward that is at least 97% of its optimal, non-deceptive value.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Goals and the Structure of Experience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15013v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning, posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation (descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal. Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral, phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse substrates.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaRL: Learning Scalable Planning Policies with Simple Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17838v3)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate reinforcement learning (RL) for privileged planning in autonomous driving. State-of-the-art approaches for this task are rule-based, but these methods do not scale to the long tail. RL, on the other hand, is scalable and does not suffer from compounding errors like imitation learning. Contemporary RL approaches for driving use complex shaped rewards that sum multiple individual rewards, \eg~progress, position, or orientation rewards. We show that PPO fails to optimize a popular version of these rewards when the mini-batch size is increased, which limits the scalability of these approaches. Instead, we propose a new reward design based primarily on optimizing a single intuitive reward term: route completion. Infractions are penalized by terminating the episode or multiplicatively reducing route completion. We find that PPO scales well with higher mini-batch sizes when trained with our simple reward, even improving performance. Training with large mini-batch sizes enables efficient scaling via distributed data parallelism. We scale PPO to 300M samples in CARLA and 500M samples in nuPlan with a single 8-GPU node. The resulting model achieves 64 DS on the CARLA longest6 v2 benchmark, outperforming other RL methods with more complex rewards by a large margin. Requiring only minimal adaptations from its use in CARLA, the same method is the best learning-based approach on nuPlan. It scores 91.3 in non-reactive and 90.6 in reactive traffic on the Val14 benchmark while being an order of magnitude faster than prior work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Conference on Robot Learning 2025</p></details> |

The design integrated Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating dynamic image challenges, Reinforcement Learning (RL) for adaptive difficulty tuning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) for creating text and audio prompts. Visual challenges included 3x3 grid selections with at least three correct images, while audio challenges combined randomized numbers and words into a single task. RL adjusted difficulty based on incorrect attempts, response time, and suspicious user behavior. Evaluations on real-world traffic demonstrated a 92% human success rate and a 10% bot bypass rate, significantly outperforming existing CAPTCHA systems. The system provided a robust and scalable approach for securing online applications while remaining accessible to users, addressing gaps highlighted in previous research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compute-Optimal Scaling for Value-Based Deep RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14881v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As models grow larger and training them becomes expensive, it becomes increasingly important to scale training recipes not just to larger models and more data, but to do so in a compute-optimal manner that extracts maximal performance per unit of compute. While such scaling has been well studied for language modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in this regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online, value-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute allocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed compute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes to maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between model size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we call TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for small models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use of large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this phenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize compute usage. Our findings provide a grounded starting point for compute-optimal scaling in deep RL, mirroring studies in supervised learning but adapted to TD learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attack on Large Language Models Using Exponentiated Gradient Descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14853v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical applications, ensuring their robustness and safety alignment remains a major challenge. Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers appended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on inefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of continuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to selected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary models. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete tokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness. We propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed one-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot encoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We provide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement an efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs. Our method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to three state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four adversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In addition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial suffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of optimized suffixes to different LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by synaptic plasticity in neuroscience, synaptic filtering introduces internal stress by selectively perturbing parameters, while adversarial attacks apply external stress through modified agent observations. This dual approach enables the classification of parameters as fragile, robust, or antifragile, based on their influence on policy performance in clean and adversarial settings. Parameter scores are defined to quantify these characteristics, and the framework is validated on PPO-trained agents in Mujoco continuous control environments. The results highlight the presence of antifragile parameters that enhance policy performance under stress, demonstrating the potential of targeted filtering techniques to improve RL policy adaptability. These insights provide a foundation for future advancements in the design of robust and antifragile RL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Withd...</summary><p>Withdrawn pending a review of attribution and overlap with Pravin et al., Artificial Intelligence (2024), DOI: 10.1016/j.artint.2023.104060.

To address this, we propose DiffQAS-QLSTM, an end-to-end differentiable framework that optimizes both VQC parameters and architecture selection during training.

In this work, we investigate whether LLM judges truly benefit from enhanced reasoning capabilities. Through a detailed analysis of reasoning requirements across evaluation tasks, we reveal a negative correlation between SFT performance gains and the proportion of reasoning-demanding samples - highlighting the limitations of SFT in such scenarios. To address this, we introduce JudgeLRM, a family of judgment-oriented LLMs trained using reinforcement learning (RL) with judge-wise, outcome-driven rewards. JudgeLRM models consistently outperform both SFT-tuned and state-of-the-art reasoning models. Notably, JudgeLRM-3B surpasses GPT-4, and JudgeLRM-7B outperforms DeepSeek-R1 by 2.79% in F1 score, particularly excelling in judge tasks requiring deep reasoning.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[TransLLM: A Unified Multi-Task Foundation Framework for Urban Transportation via Learnable Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14782v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban transportation systems encounter diverse challenges across multiple tasks, such as traffic forecasting, electric vehicle (EV) charging demand prediction, and taxi dispatch. Existing approaches suffer from two key limitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and data-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while large language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural language interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical reasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose TransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal modeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our approach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex dependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph attention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured embeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via reinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input characteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework operates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations, dynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and projecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to generate task-specific predictions. Experiments across seven datasets and three tasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised and zero-shot settings. Compared to ten baseline models, it delivers competitive performance on both regression and planning problems, showing strong generalization and cross-task adaptability.

To address these challenges, we introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.</p></details> |  |

However, this task is inherently under-constrained: multiple valid code implementations can produce the same visual chart, and evaluation must consider both code correctness and visual fidelity across diverse dimensions. This makes it difficult to learn accurate and generalizable mappings through standard supervised fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose a dual preference-guided refinement framework that combines a feedback-driven, dual-modality reward mechanism with iterative preference learning. Our approach introduces a structured variant generation strategy and a visual reward model to efficiently produce high-quality, aspect-aware preference pairs-making preference collection scalable and supervision more targeted. These preferences are used in an offline reinforcement learning setup to optimize the model toward multi-dimensional fidelity. Experimental results show that our framework significantly enhances the performance of general-purpose open-source MLLMs, enabling them to generate high-quality plotting code that rivals specialized chart-centric models and even some proprietary systems.

Beyond sampling efficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to keep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated growth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent approaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and language, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization capabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing approaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a hierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such designs are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally diversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a framework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously compile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast neural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the high-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the high-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and generalization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We evaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill compilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over time.</p></details> | 42 pages |

Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) addresses this challenge by dynamically selecting a subset of informative features for each data instance, trading predictive performance against acquisition cost. While numerous methods have been proposed for AFA, ranging from greedy information-theoretic strategies to non-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of these methods has been hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our benchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports a wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that enables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate representative algorithms from all major categories, including static, greedy, and reinforcement learning-based approaches. To test the lookahead capabilities of AFA policies, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset, AFAContext, designed to expose the limitations of greedy selection. Our results highlight key trade-offs between different AFA strategies and provide actionable insights for future research.

| **[Energy-Efficient Routing Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14679v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient energy management is essential in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to extend network lifetime and ensure reliable data transmission. This paper presents a novel method using reinforcement learning-based cluster-head selection and a hybrid multi-hop routing algorithm, which leverages Q-learning within a multi-agent system to dynamically adapt transmission paths based on the energy distribution across sensor nodes. Each sensor node is modeled as an autonomous agent that observes local state parameters, such as residual energy, distance to sink, hop count, and hotspot proximity, and selects routing actions that maximize long-term energy efficiency. After computing the optimal paths, each sensor aggregates sensed data and forwards it through intermediate nodes to a selected transmitter node, chosen based on the highest remaining State of Charge (SoC), thereby avoiding premature node depletion. To promote efficient learning, a carefully designed reward function incentivizes balanced load distribution, hotspot avoidance, and energy-aware forwarding while maintaining signal quality. The learning process occurs either in a decentralized manner or via a cloud-based controller that offloads computation in large-scale deployments. Moreover, the RL-driven routing decisions are fused with classical graph-based methods, Minimum Energy Routing Algorithm (MERA) and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), to optimize energy consumption and load balancing. Simulations confirm that the proposed approach significantly improves node survival rate, reduces SoC variance, and enhances network resilience, making it a scalable and adaptive solution for energy-constrained WSNs in dynamic sensor deployments and IoT applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Vision-Based Coverage Optimization in Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks: A Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14676v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) typically rely on pre-analysis of the target area, network size, and sensor coverage to determine initial deployment. This often results in significant overlap to ensure continued network operation despite sensor energy depletion. With the emergence of Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs), issues such as sensor failure and static coverage limitations can be more effectively addressed through mobility. This paper proposes a novel deployment strategy in which mobile sensors autonomously position themselves to maximize area coverage, eliminating the need for predefined policies. A live camera system, combined with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), monitors the network by detecting sensor LED indicators and evaluating real-time coverage. Rewards based on coverage efficiency and sensor movement are computed at each learning step and shared across the network through a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework, enabling decentralized, cooperative sensor control. Key contributions include a vision-based, low-cost coverage evaluation method; a scalable MARL-DRL framework for autonomous deployment; and a self-reconfigurable system that adjusts sensor positioning in response to energy depletion. Compared to traditional distance-based localization, the proposed method achieves a 26.5% improvement in coverage, a 32% reduction in energy consumption, and a 22% decrease in redundancy, extending network lifetime by 45%. This approach significantly enhances adaptability, energy efficiency, and robustness in MWSNs, offering a practical deployment solution within the IoT framework.</p></details> |  |

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible benchmark for future studies.

Urban flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions, threatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation) requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency. Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent coordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven optimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily light rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and system robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware, knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban flood response.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages including appendix, 6 figures</p></details> |

Thus, recommendation in our scenario is challenging because we should take into account user's interest and real-time location at the same time. In the face of such complex scenarios, end-to-end generative recommendation has emerged as a new paradigm, such as OneRec in the short video scenario, OneSug in the search scenario, and EGA in the advertising scenario. However, in local life service, an end-to-end generative recommendation model has not yet been developed as there are some key challenges to be solved. The first challenge is how to make full use of geographic information. The second challenge is how to balance multiple objectives, including user interests, the distance between user and stores, and some other business objectives. To address the challenges, we propose OneLoc. Specifically, we leverage geographic information from different perspectives: (1) geo-aware semantic ID incorporates both video and geographic information for tokenization, (2) geo-aware self-attention in the encoder leverages both video location similarity and user's real-time location, and (3) neighbor-aware prompt captures rich context information surrounding users for generation. To balance multiple objectives, we use reinforcement learning and propose two reward functions, i.e., geographic reward and GMV reward. With the above design, OneLoc achieves outstanding offline and online performance. In fact, OneLoc has been deployed in local life service of Kuaishou App. It serves 400 million active users daily, achieving 21.016% and 17.891% improvements in terms of gross merchandise value (GMV) and orders numbers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Language Multi-Agent Learning with Credit Re-Assignment for Interactive Environment Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14496v3)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agents have made significant advancements in interactive environments, such as mobile operations and web browsing, and other domains beyond computer using. Current multi-agent systems universally excel in performance, compared to single agents, but struggle with generalization across environments due to predefined roles and inadequate strategies for generalizing language agents. The challenge of achieving both strong performance and good generalization has hindered the progress of multi-agent systems for interactive environments. To address these issues, we propose CollabUIAgents, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with a novel multi-agent credit re-assignment (CR) strategy, assigning process rewards with LLMs rather than environment-specific rewards and learning with synthesized preference data, in order to foster generalizable, collaborative behaviors among the role-free agents' policies. Empirical results show that our framework improves both performance and cross-environment generalizability of multi-agent systems. Moreover, our 7B-parameter system achieves results on par with or exceed strong closed-source models, and the LLM that guides the CR. We also provide insights in using granular CR rewards effectively for environment generalization, and accommodating trained LLMs in multi-agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in COLM2025</p></details> |

Despite this success, we identify three key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback: performance plateaus, limited effectiveness of spontaneous self-reflection, and persistent failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques. Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and critique-guided self-refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration. Additionally, we employ a shaping function to amplify learning from correct, especially unfamiliar, refinements and penalize incorrect ones. Extensive experiments with Qwen2.5-7B-Base, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base, and Qwen3-8B demonstrate that Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning and RL-based fine-tuning methods across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general reasoning tasks. Specifically, Critique-GRPO improves average pass@1 scores across all compared methods by approximately +4.4% on Qwen2.5-7B-Base and +3.8% on Qwen3-8B. Notably, Critique-GRPO enables effective self-improvement through self-critiquing, achieving significant gains over GRPO, e.g., +16.7% pass@1 improvement on AIME 2024.</p></details> | <details><summary>52 pa...</summary><p>52 pages, updated with new experimental results and implementation details</p></details> |

This limitation can be mitigated by leveraging suboptimal, open-ended play data, often easier to collect and offering greater diversity. This work builds upon recent advances in generative modeling, specifically Flow Matching, an alternative to Diffusion models. We introduce a method for estimating the minimum or maximum of the learned distribution by leveraging the unique properties of Flow Matching, namely, deterministic transport and support for arbitrary source distributions. We apply this method to develop several goal-conditioned imitation and reinforcement learning algorithms based on Flow Matching, where policies are conditioned on both current and goal observations. We explore and compare different architectural configurations by combining core components, such as critic, planner, actor, or world model, in various ways. We evaluated our agents on the OGBench benchmark and analyzed how different demonstration behaviors during data collection affect performance in a 2D non-prehensile pushing task. Furthermore, we validated our approach on real hardware by deploying it on the Talos humanoid robot to perform complex manipulation tasks based on high-dimensional image observations, featuring a sequence of pick-and-place and articulated object manipulation in a realistic kitchen environment. Experimental videos and code are available at: https://hucebot.github.io/extremum_flow_matching_website/</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE-RAS 24th International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids), Sep 2025, Seoul, South Korea</p></details> |
| **[Beyond ReLU: Chebyshev-DQN for Enhanced Deep Q-Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14536v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is critically dependent on the ability of its underlying neural network to accurately approximate the action-value function. Standard function approximators, such as multi-layer perceptrons, may struggle to efficiently represent the complex value landscapes inherent in many reinforcement learning problems. This paper introduces a novel architecture, the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates a Chebyshev polynomial basis into the DQN framework to create a more effective feature representation. By leveraging the powerful function approximation properties of Chebyshev polynomials, we hypothesize that the Ch-DQN can learn more efficiently and achieve higher performance. We evaluate our proposed model on the CartPole-v1 benchmark and compare it against a standard DQN with a comparable number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that the Ch-DQN with a moderate polynomial degree (N=4) achieves significantly better asymptotic performance, outperforming the baseline by approximately 39\%. However, we also find that the choice of polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter, as a high degree (N=8) can be detrimental to learning. This work validates the potential of using orthogonal polynomial bases in deep reinforcement learning while also highlighting the trade-offs involved in model complexity.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches largely rely on predefined threat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose diverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a framework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning novel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows. Given a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario Generation, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving knowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is both plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then specified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently, Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat introduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to identify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are designed to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and create critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple reinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe collision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our ScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different simulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios improves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through real-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated scenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope our paper can build up a critical step towards building public trust and ensuring their safe deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Actor-Critic Training with Steerable Action-Value Approximation Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03890v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy actor-critic algorithms have shown strong potential in deep reinforcement learning for continuous control tasks. Their success primarily comes from leveraging pessimistic state-action value function updates, which reduce function approximation errors and stabilize learning. However, excessive pessimism can limit exploration, preventing the agent from effectively refining its policies. Conversely, optimism can encourage exploration but may lead to high-risk behaviors and unstable learning if not carefully managed. To address this trade-off, we propose Utility Soft Actor-Critic (USAC), a novel framework that allows independent, interpretable control of pessimism and optimism for both the actor and the critic. USAC dynamically adapts its exploration strategy based on the uncertainty of critics using a utility function, enabling a task-specific balance between optimism and pessimism. This approach goes beyond binary choices of pessimism or optimism, making the method both theoretically meaningful and practically feasible. Experiments across a variety of continuous control tasks show that adjusting the degree of pessimism or optimism significantly impacts performance. When configured appropriately, USAC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating its practical utility and feasibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Exploration with PAC-Bayes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03055v5)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous control under delayed rewards is an under-explored problem despite its significance in real-world applications. Many complex skills are based on intermediate ones as prerequisites. For instance, a humanoid locomotor must learn how to stand before it can learn to walk. To cope with delayed reward, an agent must perform deep exploration. However, existing deep exploration methods are designed for small discrete action spaces, and their generalization to state-of-the-art continuous control remains unproven. We address the deep exploration problem for the first time from a PAC-Bayesian perspective in the context of actor-critic learning. To do this, we quantify the error of the Bellman operator through a PAC-Bayes bound, where a bootstrapped ensemble of critic networks represents the posterior distribution, and their targets serve as a data-informed function-space prior. We derive an objective function from this bound and use it to train the critic ensemble. Each critic trains an individual soft actor network, implemented as a shared trunk and critic-specific heads. The agent performs deep exploration by acting epsilon-softly on a randomly chosen actor head. Our proposed algorithm, named {\it PAC-Bayesian Actor-Critic (PBAC)}, is the only algorithm to consistently discover delayed rewards on continuous control tasks with varying difficulty.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECAI ...</summary><p>ECAI camera-ready version; fixed acknowledgements; fixed github reference</p></details> |

Modern vehicular environments demand low-latency and high-throughput communication, yet real-time network selection is hindered by diverse application requirements and the coexistence of multiple Radio Access Technologies (RATs) such as 4G, 5G, and ad hoc links. ANS-V2X employs a heuristic-driven approach to assign vehicles to networks by considering application sensitivity, latency, computational load, and directionality constraints. The framework is benchmarked against a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for optimal solutions and a Q-learning-based method representing reinforcement learning. Simulation results demonstrate that ANS-V2X achieves near-optimal performance, typically within 5 to 10% of the utility achieved by MILP-V2X, while reducing execution time by more than 85%. Although MILP-V2X offers globally optimal results, its computation time often exceeds 100 milliseconds, making it unsuitable for real-time applications. The Q-learning-based method is more adaptable but requires extensive training and converges slowly in dynamic scenarios. In contrast, ANS-V2X completes decisions in under 15 milliseconds and consistently delivers lower latency than both alternatives. This confirms its suitability for real-time, edge-level deployment in latency-critical V2X systems</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for IEEE Access</p></details> |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in handling such scenarios by providing high-level scene understanding and user-aligned decisions. However, existing VLMs often exhibit a misalignment between their language-based reasoning and the low-level trajectories required for action-level planning. In this paper, we propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to fine-tune VLMs using planning-oriented metrics. Experimental results show that LaViPlan improves planning performance across both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. While linguistic fidelity slightly decreases after RLVR-based fine-tuning, qualitative evaluation indicates that the outputs remain coherent. We also conduct ablation studies to analyze the effects of sampling ratio and reasoning guidance, highlighting how these design choices influence performance. These findings demonstrate the potential of RLVR as a post-training paradigm for aligning language-guided reasoning with action-level planning in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2nd ICCV 2025 Workshop on the Challenge of Out-of-Label Hazards in Autonomous Driving (13 pages, 6 figures)</p></details> |

DuPO addresses two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g., translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information (e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically, DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks, and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general, and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures, |
| **[When Good Sounds Go Adversarial: Jailbreaking Audio-Language Models with Benign Inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03365v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models become increasingly integrated into daily life, audio has emerged as a key interface for human-AI interaction. However, this convenience also introduces new vulnerabilities, making audio a potential attack surface for adversaries. Our research introduces WhisperInject, a two-stage adversarial audio attack framework that can manipulate state-of-the-art audio language models to generate harmful content. Our method uses imperceptible perturbations in audio inputs that remain benign to human listeners. The first stage uses a novel reward-based optimization method, Reinforcement Learning with Projected Gradient Descent (RL-PGD), to guide the target model to circumvent its own safety protocols and generate harmful native responses. This native harmful response then serves as the target for Stage 2, Payload Injection, where we use Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to optimize subtle perturbations that are embedded into benign audio carriers, such as weather queries or greeting messages. Validated under the rigorous StrongREJECT, LlamaGuard, as well as Human Evaluation safety evaluation framework, our experiments demonstrate a success rate exceeding 86% across Qwen2.5-Omni-3B, Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, and Phi-4-Multimodal. Our work demonstrates a new class of practical, audio-native threats, moving beyond theoretical exploits to reveal a feasible and covert method for manipulating AI behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[DEPTH: Hallucination-Free Relation Extraction via Dependency-Aware Sentence Simplification and Two-tiered Hierarchical Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14391v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relation extraction enables the construction of structured knowledge for many downstream applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation classification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related entity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine whether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence structures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such hallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the integrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these challenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware sEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the relation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs, DEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for each pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence into a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise while preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local predictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence, correcting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a causality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling spurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning with human feedback. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DEPTH reduces the average hallucination rate to 7.0\% while achieving a 17.2\% improvement in average F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRINN: Contrastive Reinforcement Learning for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02091v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual refinement.

Beyond the sheer number of subsystems involved, the difficulty stems from their diversity and interaction depth. In this paper, we use a compact heterogeneous robotic system (HeROS), combining mobile and manipulation capabilities, as a demonstration vehicle under dynamically changing tasks. Notably, all its subsystems are powered by ROS. The use of compatible interfaces and other ROS integration capabilities simplifies the construction of such systems. However, this only addresses part of the complexity: the semantic coherence and structural traceability are even more important for precise coordination and call for deliberate engineering methods. The Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) discipline, which emerged from the experience of complexity management in large-scale engineering domains, offers the methodological foundations needed. Despite their strengths in complementary aspects of robotics systems engineering, the lack of a unified approach to integrate ROS and MBSE hinders the full potential of these tools. Motivated by the anticipated impact of such a synergy in robotics practice, we propose a structured methodology based on MeROS - a SysML metamodel created specifically to put the ROS-based systems into the focus of the MBSE workflow. As its methodological backbone, we adapt the well-known V-model to this context, illustrating how complex robotic systems can be designed with traceability and validation capabilities embedded into their lifecycle using practices familiar to engineering teams.</p></details> | 22 pages |

These robots are prone to undesirable behaviours like sinking and slipping on challenging terrains. To combat this issue, we propose a terrain classifier that provides information on terrain type that can be used in robotic systems to create a traversability map to plan safer paths for the robot to navigate. The work presented here is a terrain classifier developed for a Boston Dynamics Spot robot. Spot provides over 100 measured proprioceptive signals describing the motions of the robot and its four legs (e.g., foot penetration, forces, joint angles, etc.). The developed terrain classifier combines dimensionality reduction techniques to extract relevant information from the signals and then applies a classification technique to differentiate terrain based on traversability. In representative field testing, the resulting terrain classifier was able to identify three different terrain types with an accuracy of approximately 97%</p></details> |  |

Current navigation models predominantly address interactions with individual pedestrians while failing to account for human groups that naturally form in real-world settings. Conversely, the limited models implementing group-aware navigation typically prioritize group dynamics at the expense of individual interactions, both of which are essential for socially appropriate navigation. This research extends an existing simulation framework to incorporate both individual pedestrians and human groups. We present Tangent Action for Group Avoidance (TAGA), a modular reactive mechanism that can be integrated with existing navigation frameworks to enhance their group-awareness capabilities. TAGA dynamically modifies robot trajectories using tangent action-based avoidance strategies while preserving the underlying model's capacity to navigate around individuals. Additionally, we introduce Group Collision Rate (GCR), a novel metric to quantitatively assess how effectively robots maintain group integrity during navigation. Through comprehensive simulation-based benchmarking, we demonstrate that integrating TAGA with state-of-the-art navigation models (ORCA, Social Force, DS-RNN, and AG-RL) reduces group intrusions by 45.7-78.6% while maintaining comparable success rates and navigation efficiency. Future work will focus on real-world implementation and validation of this approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures.

However, creating an integrated structural system that can effectively balance the competing requirements of high packing efficiency, simple deployment, and precise morphing into multiple load-bearing configurations remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a new class of hyper-Yoshimura origami, which exhibits a wide range of kinematically admissible and locally metastable states, including newly discovered symmetric "self-packing" and asymmetric "pop-out" states. This metastability is achieved by breaking a design rule of Yoshimura origami that has been in place for many decades. To this end, this study derives a new set of mathematically rigorous design rules and geometric formulations. Based on this, forward and inverse kinematic strategies are developed to stack hyper-Yoshimura modules into deployable booms that can approximate complex 3D shapes. Finally, this study showcases the potential of hyper-Yoshimura with a meter-scale pop-up cellphone charging station deployed at our university's bus transit station, along with a 3D-printed, scaled prototype of a space crane that can function as an object manipulator, solar tracking device, or high-load-bearing structure. These results establish hyper-Yoshimura as a promising platform for deployable and adaptable robotic systems in both terrestrial and space environments.</p></details> |  |

Exploring the Effects of a Structured Interface with ChatGPT in a Graduate Robotics Course](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07767v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior research shows that how students engage with Large Language Models (LLMs) influences their problem-solving and understanding, reinforcing the need to support productive LLM-uses that promote learning. This study evaluates the impact of a structured GPT platform designed to promote 'good' prompting behavior with data from 58 students in a graduate-level robotics course. The students were assigned to either an intervention group using the structured platform or a control group using ChatGPT freely for two practice lab sessions, before a third session where all students could freely use ChatGPT. We analyzed student perception (pre-post surveys), prompting behavior (logs), performance (task scores), and learning (pre-post tests). Although we found no differences in performance or learning between groups, we identified prompting behaviors - such as having clear prompts focused on understanding code - that were linked with higher learning gains and were more prominent when students used the structured platform. However, such behaviors did not transfer once students were no longer constrained to use the structured platform. Qualitative survey data showed mixed perceptions: some students perceived the value of the structured platform, but most did not perceive its relevance and resisted changing their habits. These findings contribute to ongoing efforts to identify effective strategies for integrating LLMs into learning and question the effectiveness of bottom-up approaches that temporarily alter user interfaces to influence students' interaction. Future research could instead explore top-down strategies that address students' motivations and explicitly demonstrate how certain interaction patterns support learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted, to appear in the proceedings of the EC-TEL 2025 conference</p></details> |

| **[Neural Robot Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15755v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators, capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world data; however, existing neural simulators typically require application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state. In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.</p></details> |  |
| **[ILeSiA: Interactive Learning of Robot Situational Awareness from Camera Input](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20173v2)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from demonstration is a promising approach for teaching robots new skills. However, a central challenge in the execution of acquired skills is the ability to recognize faults and prevent failures. This is essential because demonstrations typically cover only a limited set of scenarios and often only the successful ones. During task execution, unforeseen situations may arise, such as changes in the robot's environment or interaction with human operators. To recognize such situations, this paper focuses on teaching the robot situational awareness by using a camera input and labeling frames as safe or risky. We train a Gaussian Process (GP) regression model fed by a low-dimensional latent space representation of the input images. The model outputs a continuous risk score ranging from zero to one, quantifying the degree of risk at each timestep. This allows for pausing task execution in unsafe situations and directly adding new training data, labeled by the human user. Our experiments on a robotic manipulator show that the proposed method can reliably detect both known and novel faults using only a single example for each new fault. In contrast, a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) performs well only on faults it has encountered during training. Our method enables the next generation of cobots to be rapidly deployed with easy-to-set-up, vision-based risk assessment, proactively safeguarding humans and detecting misaligned parts or missing objects before failures occur. We provide all the code and data required to reproduce our experiments at imitrob.ciirc.cvut.cz/publications/ilesia.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures.

Existing work has proven that some crucial restrictions on choreographies and initial configurations (e.g., on repetitions of patterns, periodicity, symmetries, contractions/expansions) must hold so that the Dancing problem can be solved under certain robot models. Here, we prove that these necessary constraints can be dropped by considering the LUMI model (i.e., where robots are endowed with a light whose color can be chosen from a constant-size palette) under the quite unexplored sequential scheduler. We formalize the class of Universal Dancing problems which require a swarm of $n$ robots starting from any initial configuration to perform a (periodic or finite) sequence of arbitrary patterns, only provided that each pattern consists of $n$ vertices (including multiplicities). However, we prove that, to be solvable under LUMI, the length of the feasible choreographies is bounded by the compositions of $n$ into the number of colors available to the robots. We provide an algorithm solving the Universal Dancing problem by exploiting the peculiar capability of sequential robots to implement a distributed counter mechanism. Even assuming non-rigid movements, our algorithm ensures spatial homogeneity of the performed choreography.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Policy: Guiding Visuomotor Robotic Manipulation with Spatial-Aware Modeling and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15874v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-centric hierarchical embodied models have demonstrated strong potential for long-horizon robotic control. However, existing methods lack spatial awareness capabilities, limiting their effectiveness in bridging visual plans to actionable control in complex environments. To address this problem, we propose Spatial Policy (SP), a unified spatial-aware visuomotor robotic manipulation framework via explicit spatial modeling and reasoning. Specifically, we first design a spatial-conditioned embodied video generation module to model spatially guided predictions through a spatial plan table. Then, we propose a spatial-based action prediction module to infer executable actions with coordination. Finally, we propose a spatial reasoning feedback policy to refine the spatial plan table via dual-stage replanning. Extensive experiments show that SP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 33.0% average improvement over the best baseline. With an 86.7% average success rate across 11 diverse tasks, SP substantially enhances the practicality of embodied models for robotic control applications.

| **[A Vision-Based Shared-Control Teleoperation Scheme for Controlling the Robotic Arm of a Four-Legged Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14994v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations. However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces. Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot, demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.</p></details> |  |

To explore this future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots, and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these, Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>websi...</summary><p>website https://virtual-community-ai.github.io/</p></details> |

This remains challenging in traditional approaches, especially with arbitrarily shaped predictions and real-time constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Risk-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral control (DRA-MPPI), a motion planner that incorporates uncertain future motions modelled with potentially non-Gaussian stochastic predictions. By leveraging MPPI's gradient-free nature, we propose a method that efficiently approximates the joint Collision Probability (CP) among multiple dynamic obstacles for several hundred sampled trajectories in real-time via a Monte Carlo (MC) approach. This enables the rejection of samples exceeding a predefined CP threshold or the integration of CP as a weighted objective within the navigation cost function. Consequently, DRA-MPPI mitigates the freezing robot problem while enhancing safety. Real-world and simulated experiments with multiple dynamic obstacles demonstrate DRA-MPPI's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, including Scenario-based Model Predictive Control (S-MPC), Frenet planner, and vanilla MPPI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at IROS 2025.

| **[Safe and Transparent Robots for Human-in-the-Loop Meat Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14763v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Labor shortages have severely affected the meat processing sector. Automated technology has the potential to support the meat industry, assist workers, and enhance job quality. However, existing automation in meat processing is highly specialized, inflexible, and cost intensive. Instead of forcing manufacturers to buy a separate device for each step of the process, our objective is to develop general-purpose robotic systems that work alongside humans to perform multiple meat processing tasks. Through a recently conducted survey of industry experts, we identified two main challenges associated with integrating these collaborative robots alongside human workers. First, there must be measures to ensure the safety of human coworkers; second, the coworkers need to understand what the robot is doing. This paper addresses both challenges by introducing a safety and transparency framework for general-purpose meat processing robots. For safety, we implement a hand-detection system that continuously monitors nearby humans. This system can halt the robot in situations where the human comes into close proximity of the operating robot. We also develop an instrumented knife equipped with a force sensor that can differentiate contact between objects such as meat, bone, or fixtures. For transparency, we introduce a method that detects the robot's uncertainty about its performance and uses an LED interface to communicate that uncertainty to the human. Additionally, we design a graphical interface that displays the robot's plans and allows the human to provide feedback on the planned cut. Overall, our framework can ensure safe operation while keeping human workers in-the-loop about the robot's actions which we validate through a user study.</p></details> |  |

Calibrating UWB anchors manually can be time-consuming and even impossible in emergencies or those situations without special calibration tools. Therefore, automatic estimation of the anchor positions becomes a necessity. The proposed method enables the creation of a soft sensor providing the position information of the anchors in a UWB network. This soft sensor requires only UWB and LiDAR measurements measured from a moving robot. The proposed FGO framework is suitable for the calibration of an extendable large UWB network. Moreover, the anchor calibration problem and robot localization problem can be solved simultaneously, which saves time for UWB network deployment. The proposed framework also helps to avoid artificial errors in the UWB-anchor position estimation and improves the accuracy and robustness of the robot-pose. The experimental results of the robot localization using LiDAR and a UWB network in a 3D environment are discussed, demonstrating the performance of the proposed method. More specifically, the anchor calibration problem with four anchors and the robot localization problem can be solved simultaneously and automatically within 30 seconds by the proposed framework. The supplementary video and codes can be accessed via https://github.com/LiuxhRobotAI/Simultaneous_calibration_localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submit to IEEE SMC 2025.

However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity, offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of visual-language models across reasoning levels.</p></details> |  |

Recent large language model (LLMs)-based approaches for scene reasoning and planning primarily focus on one-shot, end-to-end solutions in known environments, lacking both dynamic adaptation capabilities for online operation and explainability in the processes of planning. To address these issues, a novel framework (DEXTER-LLM) for dynamic task planning in unknown environments, integrates four modules: (i) a mission comprehension module that resolves partial ordering of tasks specified by natural languages or linear temporal logic formulas (LTL); (ii) an online subtask generator based on LLMs that improves the accuracy and explainability of task decomposition via multi-stage reasoning; (iii) an optimal subtask assigner and scheduler that allocates subtasks to robots via search-based optimization; and (iv) a dynamic adaptation and human-in-the-loop verification module that implements multi-rate, event-based updates for both subtasks and their assignments, to cope with new features and tasks detected online. The framework effectively combines LLMs' open-world reasoning capabilities with the optimality of model-based assignment methods, simultaneously addressing the critical issue of online adaptability and explainability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate exceptional performances, with 100% success rates across all scenarios, 160 tasks and 480 subtasks completed on average (3 times the baselines), 62% less queries to LLMs during adaptation, and superior plan quality (2 times higher) for compound tasks.

| **[Multi-Robot Navigation in Social Mini-Games: Definitions, Taxonomy, and Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13459v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ``Last Mile Challenge'' has long been considered an important, yet unsolved, challenge for autonomous vehicles, public service robots, and delivery robots. A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to navigate constrained and cluttered environments that have high agency (e.g., doorways, hallways, corridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and humans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). Traditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs, which has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers. However, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on centralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation, etc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described informally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc representation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting to start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own taxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research moving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a well-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly. It also discusses the essential properties of SMG solvers, defines what SMGs are and how they appear in practice, outlines how to evaluate SMG solvers, and highlights the differences between SMG solvers and general navigation systems. The survey concludes with an overview of future directions and open challenges in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-optimal Asynchronous Minimal Vertex Covering by Myopic Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14247v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a connected graph with an autonomous robot swarm with limited visibility, it is natural to ask whether the robots can be deployed to certain vertices satisfying a given property using only local knowledge. This paper affirmatively answers the question with a set of \emph{myopic} (finite visibility range) luminous robots with the aim of \emph{filling a minimal vertex cover} (MVC) of a given graph $G = (V, E)$. The graph has special vertices, called \emph{doors}, through which robots enter sequentially. Starting from the doors, the goal of the robots is to settle on a set of vertices that forms a minimal vertex cover of $G$ under the asynchronous ($\mathcal{ASYNC}$) scheduler. We are also interested in achieving the \emph{minimum vertex cover} (MinVC, which is NP-hard \cite{Karp1972} for general graphs) for a specific graph class using the myopic robots. We establish lower bounds on the visibility range for the robots and on the time complexity (which is $\Omega(|E|)$). We present two algorithms for trees: one for single door, which is both time and memory-optimal, and the other for multiple doors, which is memory-optimal and achieves time-optimality when the number of doors is a constant. Interestingly, our technique achieves MinVC on trees with a single door. We then move to the general graph, where we present two algorithms, one for the single door and the other for the multiple doors with an extra memory of $O(\log \Delta)$ for the robots, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of $G$. All our algorithms run in $O(|E|)$ epochs.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm, offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action gap in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Embod...</summary><p>Embodied-R1 technical report</p></details> |
| **[The Social Context of Human-Robot Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13982v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) community often highlights the social context of an interaction as a key consideration when designing, implementing, and evaluating robot behavior. Unfortunately, researchers use the term "social context" in varied ways. This can lead to miscommunication, making it challenging to draw connections between related work on understanding and modeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions. To address this gap, we survey the HRI literature for existing definitions and uses of the term "social context". Then, we propose a conceptual model for describing the social context of a human-robot interaction. We apply this model to existing work, and we discuss a range of attributes of social contexts that can help researchers plan for interactions, develop behavior models for robots, and gain insights after interactions have taken place. We conclude with a discussion of open research questions in relation to understanding and modeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Annual Review of Control, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems</p></details> |

To achieve that, HRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. To achieve that, HRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. In this position paper, we outline an interaction-based framework for building trust through mutual understanding between humans and robots. We emphasize two main pillars: human awareness and transparency, referring to the robot ability to interpret human actions accurately and to clearly communicate its intentions and goals, respectively. By integrating these two pillars, robots can behave in a manner that aligns with human expectations and needs while providing their human partners with both comprehension and control over their actions. We also introduce four components that we think are important for bridging the gap between a human-perceived sense of trust and a robot true capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, presented at TRUST workshop, organised in conjunction with the IEEE RO-MAN 2025 conference, held in Eindhoven, Netherlands</p></details> |
| **[Toward Deployable Multi-Robot Collaboration via a Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13877v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential in robotic operations. However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such as multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a promising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence modeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations still remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a neuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable multi-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic planner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic subgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer (GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot manipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable, and generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks. We evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work to explore DT-based technology for multi-robot manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blast Hole Seeking and Dipping -- The Navigation and Perception Framework in a Mine Site Inspection Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13785v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In open-pit mining, holes are drilled into the surface of the excavation site and detonated with explosives to facilitate digging. These blast holes need to be inspected internally for investigation of downhole material types and properties. Knowing these properties can lead to significant savings in material handling costs in downstream processes. Manual hole inspection is slow and expensive, with major limitations in revealing the geometric and geological properties of the holes and their contents. This has been the motivation for the development of our autonomous mine-site inspection robot - "DIPPeR". In this paper, the automation aspect of the project is explained. We present a robust blast hole seeking and detection framework that enables target-based navigation and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. The pipeline first processes point-cloud data collected by the on-board LiDAR sensors, extracting the cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above the ground. By projecting the 3D cone points into a virtual depth image, segmentation is achieved in the 2D domain, yielding a circular hole at the image centre and a collared cone face. We then identify the hole centre using a robust detection module while suppressing non-maximum candidates, ensuring precise sensor placement for down-hole inspection and avoiding collisions with the cavity wall. To enable autonomous hole-seeking, the pipeline automatically adjusts its projection parameters during robot navigation to account for variations in point sparsity and hole opening size, ensuring a consistent hole appearance in 2D images. This allows continuous tracking of the target hole as the robot approaches the goal point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our navigation and perception system in both high-fidelity simulation environments and on-site field tests.

Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators, interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to the demands of mobile robotics.

However, current gaze-based assistive systems mainly help users with basic grasping actions, offering limited support. Moreover, the restricted intent recognition capability constrains the assistive system's ability to provide diverse assistance functions. In this paper, we propose an open implicit intention recognition framework powered by Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Foundation Model (VFM), which can process gaze input and recognize user intents that are not confined to predefined or specific scenarios. Furthermore, we implement a gaze-driven LLM-enhanced assistive robot system (MindEye-OmniAssist) that recognizes user's intentions through gaze and assists in completing task. To achieve this, the system utilizes open vocabulary object detector, intention recognition network and LLM to infer their full intentions. By integrating eye movement feedback and LLM, it generates action sequences to assist the user in completing tasks. Real-world experiments have been conducted for assistive tasks, and the system achieved an overall success rate of 41/55 across various undefined tasks. Preliminary results show that the proposed method holds the potential to provide a more user-friendly human-computer interaction interface and significantly enhance the versatility and effectiveness of assistive systems by supporting more complex and diverse task.</p></details> |  |

For this, robots need to be equipped with communication strategies that enhance momentary transparency and reduce the probability of critical situations. Adapting these robotic strategies requires consideration of robot movements, environmental conditions, and user characteristics and states. While numerous studies have investigated the impact of distraction on pedestrians' movement behavior, limited research has examined this behavior in the presence of autonomous robots. This research addresses the impact of robot type and robot movement pattern on distracted and undistracted pedestrians' movement behavior. In a field setting, unaware pedestrians were videotaped while moving past two working, autonomous cleaning robots. Out of N=498 observed pedestrians, approximately 8% were distracted by smartphones. Distracted and undistracted pedestrians did not exhibit significant differences in their movement behaviors around the robots. Instead, both the larger sweeping robot and the offset rectangular movement pattern significantly increased the number of lateral adaptations compared to the smaller cleaning robot and the circular movement pattern. The offset rectangular movement pattern also led to significantly more close lateral adaptations. Depending on the robot type, the movement patterns led to differences in the distances of lateral adaptations. The study provides initial insights into pedestrian movement behavior around an autonomous cleaning robot in public spaces, contributing to the growing field of HRI research.</p></details> |  |

The framework enables the full-state feedback estimator to estimate and compensate for uncertainties in whole-body dynamics of the legged robots. First, we propose a novel moving horizon extended state observer (MH-ESO) to estimate uncertainties and mitigate noise in legged systems, which can be integrated into the framework for disturbance compensation. Second, we introduce a three-level whole-body disturbance rejection control framework (T-WB-DRC). Unlike the previous two-level approach, this three-level framework considers both the plan based on whole-body dynamics without uncertainties and the plan based on dynamics with uncertainties, significantly improving payload transportation, external disturbance rejection, and fault tolerance. Third, simulations of both humanoid and quadruped robots in the Gazebo simulator demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of T-WB-DRC. Finally, extensive experimental trials on a quadruped robot validate the robustness and stability of the system when using T-WB-DRC under various disturbance conditions.</p></details> |  |

We validate the system on a Unitree G1 humanoid with an open-source whole-body controller, establishing a quantitative baseline for the robot's performance against a human player. In the paper, we discuss these results, which demonstrate the feasibility of using commercial games platform as physically grounded benchmarks and motivate future work to for benchmarking embodied AI.</p></details> | Workshop Submission |
| **[Integrating emotional intelligence, memory architecture, and gestures to achieve empathetic humanoid robot interaction in an educational setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19803v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the integration of individual human traits into an empathetically adaptive educational robot tutor system designed to improve student engagement and learning outcomes with corresponding Engagement Vector measurement. While prior research in the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has examined the integration of the traits, such as emotional intelligence, memory-driven personalization, and non-verbal communication, by themselves, they have thus-far neglected to consider their synchronized integration into a cohesive, operational education framework. To address this gap, we customize a Multi-Modal Large Language Model (LLaMa 3.2 from Meta) deployed with modules for human-like traits (emotion, memory and gestures) into an AI-Agent framework. This constitutes to the robot's intelligent core mimicing the human emotional system, memory architecture and gesture control to allow the robot to behave more empathetically while recognizing and responding appropriately to the student's emotional state. It can also recall the student's past learning record and adapt its style of interaction accordingly. This allows the robot tutor to react to the student in a more sympathetic manner by delivering personalized verbal feedback synchronized with relevant gestures. Our study investigates the extent of this effect through the introduction of Engagement Vector Model which can be a surveyor's pole for judging the quality of HRI experience. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that such an empathetic responsive approach significantly improves student engagement and learning outcomes compared with a baseline humanoid robot without these human-like traits. This indicates that robot tutors with empathetic capabilities can create a more supportive, interactive learning experience that ultimately leads to better outcomes for the student.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Surveillance Based Interactive Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13319v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We build a mobile surveillance robot that streams video in real time and responds to speech so a user can monitor and steer it from a phone or browser. The system uses two Raspberry Pi 4 units: a front unit on a differential drive base with camera, mic, and speaker, and a central unit that serves the live feed and runs perception. Video is sent with FFmpeg. Objects in the scene are detected using YOLOv3 to support navigation and event awareness. For voice interaction, we use Python libraries for speech recognition, multilingual translation, and text-to-speech, so the robot can take spoken commands and read back responses in the requested language. A Kinect RGB-D sensor provides visual input and obstacle cues. In indoor tests the robot detects common objects at interactive frame rates on CPU, recognises commands reliably, and translates them to actions without manual control. The design relies on off-the-shelf hardware and open software, making it easy to reproduce. We discuss limits and practical extensions, including sensor fusion with ultrasonic range data, GPU acceleration, and adding face and text recognition.</p></details> | 4 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning in Multi-Goal Spatial Navigation with Autonomous Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18794v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is hypothesized to be able to leverage the inherent hierarchy in learning tasks where traditional reinforcement learning (RL) often fails. In this research, HRL is evaluated and contrasted with traditional RL in complex robotic navigation tasks. We evaluate unique characteristics of HRL, including its ability to create sub-goals and the termination functions. We constructed a number of experiments to test: 1) the differences between RL proximal policy optimization (PPO) and HRL, 2) different ways of creating sub-goals in HRL, 3) manual vs automatic sub-goal creation in HRL, and 4) the effects of the frequency of termination on performance in HRL. These experiments highlight the advantages of HRL over RL and how it achieves these advantages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large VLM-based Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13073v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation, a key frontier in robotics and embodied AI, requires precise motor control and multimodal understanding, yet traditional rule-based methods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured, novel environments. In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation. We provide a regularly updated project page to document ongoing progress: https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/Large-VLM-based-VLA-for-Robotic-Manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/Large-VLM-based-VLA-for-Robotic-Manipulation</p></details> |

However, they are still missing a fundamental social skill: making use of the multiple modalities that carry social interactions. While previous work has focused on task-oriented interactions that require referencing the environment or specific phenomena in social interactions such as dialogue breakdowns, we outline the overall needs of a multimodal system for social conversations with robots. We then argue that vision-language models are able to process this wide range of visual information in a sufficiently general manner for autonomous social robots. We describe how to adapt them to this setting, which technical challenges remain, and briefly discuss evaluation practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the workshop "Human - Foundation Models Interaction: A Focus On Multimodal Information" (FoMo-HRI) at IEEE RO-MAN 2025 (Camera-ready version)</p></details> |
| **[STRAP: Robot Sub-Trajectory Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15182v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning is witnessing a significant increase in the size, diversity, and complexity of pre-collected datasets, mirroring trends in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the "sub"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at https://weirdlabuw.github.io/strap/</p></details> |
| **[RoboRetriever: Single-Camera Robot Object Retrieval via Active and Interactive Perception with Dynamic Scene Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12916v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans effortlessly retrieve objects in cluttered, partially observable environments by combining visual reasoning, active viewpoint adjustment, and physical interaction-with only a single pair of eyes. In contrast, most existing robotic systems rely on carefully positioned fixed or multi-camera setups with complete scene visibility, which limits adaptability and incurs high hardware costs. We present \textbf{RoboRetriever}, a novel framework for real-world object retrieval that operates using only a \textbf{single} wrist-mounted RGB-D camera and free-form natural language instructions. RoboRetriever grounds visual observations to build and update a \textbf{dynamic hierarchical scene graph} that encodes object semantics, geometry, and inter-object relations over time. The supervisor module reasons over this memory and task instruction to infer the target object and coordinate an integrated action module combining \textbf{active perception}, \textbf{interactive perception}, and \textbf{manipulation}. To enable task-aware scene-grounded active perception, we introduce a novel visual prompting scheme that leverages large reasoning vision-language models to determine 6-DoF camera poses aligned with the semantic task goal and geometry scene context. We evaluate RoboRetriever on diverse real-world object retrieval tasks, including scenarios with human intervention, demonstrating strong adaptability and robustness in cluttered scenes with only one RGB-D camera.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Model-Predictive Control of a Soft Continuum Robot Using a Physics-Informed Neural Network Based on Cosserat Rod Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12681v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic control of soft continuum robots (SCRs) holds great potential for expanding their applications, but remains a challenging problem due to the high computational demands of accurate dynamic models. While data-driven approaches like Koopman-operator-based methods have been proposed, they typically lack adaptability and cannot capture the full robot shape, limiting their applicability. This work introduces a real-time-capable nonlinear model-predictive control (MPC) framework for SCRs based on a domain-decoupled physics-informed neural network (DD-PINN) with adaptable bending stiffness. The DD-PINN serves as a surrogate for the dynamic Cosserat rod model with a speed-up factor of 44000. It is also used within an unscented Kalman filter for estimating the model states and bending compliance from end-effector position measurements. We implement a nonlinear evolutionary MPC running at 70 Hz on the GPU. In simulation, it demonstrates accurate tracking of dynamic trajectories and setpoint control with end-effector position errors below 3 mm (2.3% of the actuator's length). In real-world experiments, the controller achieves similar accuracy and accelerations up to 3.55 m/s2.</p></details> | 20 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Embodied Image Quality Assessment for Robotic Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18774v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Quality Assessment (IQA) of User-Generated Content (UGC) is a critical technique for human Quality of Experience (QoE). However, does the the image quality of Robot-Generated Content (RGC) demonstrate traits consistent with the Moravec paradox, potentially conflicting with human perceptual norms? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the perception mechanism of embodied robots for image quality. We propose the first Embodied Preference Database (EPD), which contains 12,500 distorted image annotations. We establish assessment metrics based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, there is a gap between UGC and RGC. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-scale Attention Embodied Image Quality Assessment called MA-EIQA. For the proposed EPD dataset, this is the first no-reference IQA model designed for embodied robot. Finally, the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Jianbo-maker/EPD_benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vibration-Based Energy Metric for Restoring Needle Alignment in Autonomous Robotic Ultrasound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06921v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise needle alignment is essential for percutaneous needle insertion in robotic ultrasound-guided procedures. However, inherent challenges such as speckle noise, needle-like artifacts, and low image resolution make robust needle detection difficult, particularly when visibility is reduced or lost. In this paper, we propose a method to restore needle alignment when the ultrasound imaging plane and the needle insertion plane are misaligned. Unlike many existing approaches that rely heavily on needle visibility in ultrasound images, our method uses a more robust feature by periodically vibrating the needle using a mechanical system. Specifically, we propose a vibration-based energy metric that remains effective even when the needle is fully out of plane. Using this metric, we develop a control strategy to reposition the ultrasound probe in response to misalignments between the imaging plane and the needle insertion plane in both translation and rotation. Experiments conducted on ex-vivo porcine tissue samples using a dual-arm robotic ultrasound-guided needle insertion system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experimental results show the translational error of 0.41$\pm$0.27 mm and the rotational error of 0.51$\pm$0.19 degrees.</p></details> | Accepted by IROS2025 |
| **[Visual Perception Engine: Fast and Flexible Multi-Head Inference for Robotic Vision Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11584v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying multiple machine learning models on resource-constrained robotic platforms for different perception tasks often results in redundant computations, large memory footprints, and complex integration challenges. In response, this work presents Visual Perception Engine (VPEngine), a modular framework designed to enable efficient GPU usage for visual multitasking while maintaining extensibility and developer accessibility. Our framework architecture leverages a shared foundation model backbone that extracts image representations, which are efficiently shared, without any unnecessary GPU-CPU memory transfers, across multiple specialized task-specific model heads running in parallel. This design eliminates the computational redundancy inherent in feature extraction component when deploying traditional sequential models while enabling dynamic task prioritization based on application demands. We demonstrate our framework's capabilities through an example implementation using DINOv2 as the foundation model with multiple task (depth, object detection and semantic segmentation) heads, achieving up to 3x speedup compared to sequential execution. Building on CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS), VPEngine offers efficient GPU utilization and maintains a constant memory footprint while allowing per-task inference frequencies to be adjusted dynamically during runtime. The framework is written in Python and is open source with ROS2 C++ (Humble) bindings for ease of use by the robotics community across diverse robotic platforms. Our example implementation demonstrates end-to-end real-time performance at $\geq$50 Hz on NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX for TensorRT optimized models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[RNBF: Real-Time RGB-D Based Neural Barrier Functions for Safe Robotic Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02294v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous safe navigation in unstructured and novel environments poses significant challenges, especially when environment information can only be provided through low-cost vision sensors. Although safe reactive approaches have been proposed to ensure robot safety in complex environments, many base their theory off the assumption that the robot has prior knowledge on obstacle locations and geometries. In this paper, we present a real-time, vision-based framework that constructs continuous, first-order differentiable Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) of unknown environments entirely online, without any pre-training, and is fully compatible with established SDF-based reactive controllers. To achieve robust performance under practical sensing conditions, our approach explicitly accounts for noise in affordable RGB-D cameras, refining the neural SDF representation online for smoother geometry and stable gradient estimates. We validate the proposed method in simulation and real-world experiments using a Fetch robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autonomous Oil Spill Response Through Liquid Neural Trajectory Modeling and Coordinated Marine Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12456v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Marine oil spills pose grave environmental and economic risks, threatening marine ecosystems, coastlines, and dependent industries. Predicting and managing oil spill trajectories is highly complex, due to the interplay of physical, chemical, and environmental factors such as wind, currents, and temperature, which makes timely and effective response challenging. Accurate real-time trajectory forecasting and coordinated mitigation are vital for minimizing the impact of these disasters. This study introduces an integrated framework combining a multi-agent swarm robotics system built on the MOOS-IvP platform with Liquid Time-Constant Neural Networks (LTCNs). The proposed system fuses adaptive machine learning with autonomous marine robotics, enabling real-time prediction, dynamic tracking, and rapid response to evolving oil spills. By leveraging LTCNs--well-suited for modeling complex, time-dependent processes--the framework achieves real-time, high-accuracy forecasts of spill movement. Swarm intelligence enables decentralized, scalable, and resilient decision-making among robot agents, enhancing collective monitoring and containment efforts. Our approach was validated using data from the Deepwater Horizon spill, where the LTC-RK4 model achieved 0.96 spatial accuracy, surpassing LSTM approaches by 23%. The integration of advanced neural modeling with autonomous, coordinated robotics demonstrates substantial improvements in prediction precision, flexibility, and operational scalability. Ultimately, this research advances the state-of-the-art for sustainable, autonomous oil spill management and environmental protection by enhancing both trajectory prediction and response coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 40 figures.

| **[The Foundational Pose as a Selection Mechanism for the Design of Tool-Wielding Multi-Finger Robotic Hands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14158v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To wield an object means to hold and move it in a way that exploits its functions. When humans wield tools -- such as writing with a pen or cutting with scissors -- our hands would reach very specific poses, often drastically different from how we pick up the same objects just to transport them. In this work, we investigate the design of tool-wielding multi-finger robotic hand through a hypothesis: If a hand can kinematically reach a foundational pose (FP) with a tool, then it can wield the tool from that FP. We interpret FPs as snapshots that capture the workings of underlying parallel mechanisms formed by the tool and the hand, and one hand can form multiple mechanisms with the same tool. We tested our hypothesis in a hand design experiment, where we developed a sampling-based multi-objective design optimization framework that uses three FPs to computationally generate many different hand designs and evaluate them. The results show that 10,785 out of the 100,480 hand designs we sampled reached the FPs; more than 99\% of the 10,785 hands that reached the FPs successfully wielded tools, supporting our hypothesis. Meanwhile, our methods provide insights into the non-convex, multi-objective hand design optimization problem -- such as clustering and the Pareto front -- that could be hard to unveil with methods that return a single ``optimal" design. Lastly, we demonstrate our methods' real-world feasibility and potential with a hardware prototype equipped with rigid endoskeleton and soft skin.</p></details> |  |

We evaluated various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and collected two datasets to study the impact of data representation and model architecture on the recognition accuracy. Our results show that spectrogram-based representations significantly improve accuracy, while model architecture plays a smaller role. We also tested generalization to new robot poses, where spectrogram-based models performed better. Implemented on a Franka Emika Research robot, two of our methods, STFT2DCNN and STT3DCNN, achieved over 95% accuracy in contact detection and gesture classification. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of external-sensor-free tactile recognition and promote further research toward cost-effective, scalable solutions for HRC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Environment Design for Multi-Robot Navigation via Continuous Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14105v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot navigation and path planning in continuous state and action spaces with uncertain environments remains an open challenge. Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the most popular paradigms for solving this task, but its real-world application has been limited due to sample inefficiency and long training periods. Moreover, the existing works using RL for multi-robot navigation lack formal guarantees while designing the environment. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and highly customizable environment for continuous-control multi-robot navigation, where the robots must visit a set of regions of interest (ROIs) by following the shortest paths. The task is formally modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We describe the multi-robot navigation task as an optimization problem and relate it to finding an optimal policy for the MDP. We crafted several variations of the environment and measured the performance using both gradient and non-gradient based RL methods: A2C, PPO, TRPO, TQC, CrossQ and ARS. To show real-world applicability, we deployed our environment to a 3-D agricultural field with uncertainties using the CoppeliaSim robot simulator and measured the robustness by running inference on the learned models. We believe our work will guide the researchers on how to develop MDP-based environments that are applicable to real-world systems and solve them using the existing state-of-the-art RL methods with limited resources and within reasonable time periods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[A robust and compliant robotic assembly control strategy for batch precision assembly task with uncertain fit types and fit amounts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12296v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In some high-precision industrial applications, robots are deployed to perform precision assembly tasks on mass batches of manufactured pegs and holes. If the peg and hole are designed with transition fit, machining errors may lead to either a clearance or an interference fit for a specific pair of components, with uncertain fit amounts. This paper focuses on the robotic batch precision assembly task involving components with uncertain fit types and fit amounts, and proposes an efficient methodology to construct the robust and compliant assembly control strategy. Specifically, the batch precision assembly task is decomposed into multiple deterministic subtasks, and a force-vision fusion controller-driven reinforcement learning method and a multi-task reinforcement learning training method (FVFC-MTRL) are proposed to jointly learn multiple compliance control strategies for these subtasks. Subsequently, the multi-teacher policy distillation approach is designed to integrate multiple trained strategies into a unified student network, thereby establishing a robust control strategy. Real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed method successfully constructs the robust control strategy for high-precision assembly task with different fit types and fit amounts. Moreover, the MTRL framework significantly improves training efficiency, and the final developed control strategy achieves superior force compliance and higher success rate compared with many existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bimanual Robot-Assisted Dressing: A Spherical Coordinate-Based Strategy for Tight-Fitting Garments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12274v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot-assisted dressing is a popular but challenging topic in the field of robotic manipulation, offering significant potential to improve the quality of life for individuals with mobility limitations. Currently, the majority of research on robot-assisted dressing focuses on how to put on loose-fitting clothing, with little attention paid to tight garments. For the former, since the armscye is larger, a single robotic arm can usually complete the dressing task successfully. However, for the latter, dressing with a single robotic arm often fails due to the narrower armscye and the property of diminishing rigidity in the armscye, which eventually causes the armscye to get stuck. This paper proposes a bimanual dressing strategy suitable for dressing tight-fitting clothing. To facilitate the encoding of dressing trajectories that adapt to different human arm postures, a spherical coordinate system for dressing is established. We uses the azimuthal angle of the spherical coordinate system as a task-relevant feature for bimanual manipulation. Based on this new coordinate, we employ Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) for imitation learning of bimanual dressing trajectories, generating dressing strategies that adapt to different human arm postures. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through various experiments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 41 figures |
| **[Robot Trains Robot: Automatic Real-World Policy Adaptation and Learning for Humanoids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12252v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation-based reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced humanoid locomotion tasks, yet direct real-world RL from scratch or adapting from pretrained policies remains rare, limiting the full potential of humanoid robots. Real-world learning, despite being crucial for overcoming the sim-to-real gap, faces substantial challenges related to safety, reward design, and learning efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Robot-Trains-Robot (RTR), a novel framework where a robotic arm teacher actively supports and guides a humanoid robot student. The RTR system provides protection, learning schedule, reward, perturbation, failure detection, and automatic resets. It enables efficient long-term real-world humanoid training with minimal human intervention. Furthermore, we propose a novel RL pipeline that facilitates and stabilizes sim-to-real transfer by optimizing a single dynamics-encoded latent variable in the real world. We validate our method through two challenging real-world humanoid tasks: fine-tuning a walking policy for precise speed tracking and learning a humanoid swing-up task from scratch, illustrating the promising capabilities of real-world humanoid learning realized by RTR-style systems.

| **[Energy Efficiency in Robotics Software: A Systematic Literature Review (2020-2024)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12170v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a systematic literature review of software-level approaches to energy efficiency in robotics published from 2020 through 2024, updating and extending pre-2020 evidence. An automated-but-audited pipeline combined Google Scholar seeding, backward/forward snowballing, and large-language-model (LLM) assistance for screening and data extraction, with ~10% human audits at each automated step and consensus-with-tie-breaks for full-text decisions. The final corpus comprises 79 peer-reviewed studies analyzed across application domain, metrics, evaluation type, energy models, major energy consumers, software technique families, and energy-quality trade-offs. Industrial settings dominate (31.6%) followed by exploration (25.3%). Motors/actuators are identified as the primary consumer in 68.4% of studies, with computing/controllers a distant second (13.9%). Simulation-only evaluations remain most common (51.9%), though hybrid evaluations are frequent (25.3%). Representational (physics-grounded) energy models predominate (87.3%). Motion and trajectory optimization is the leading technique family (69.6%), often paired with learning/prediction (40.5%) and computation allocation/scheduling (26.6%); power management/idle control (11.4%) and communication/data efficiency (3.8%) are comparatively underexplored. Reporting is heterogeneous: composite objectives that include energy are most common, while task-normalized and performance-per-energy metrics appear less often, limiting cross-paper comparability. The review offers a minimal reporting checklist (e.g., total energy and average power plus a task-normalized metric and clear baselines) and highlights opportunities in cross-layer designs and in quantifying non-performance trade-offs (accuracy, stability). A replication package with code, prompts, and frozen datasets accompanies the review.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain Translation of a Soft Robotic Arm using Conditional Cycle Generative Adversarial Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14100v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning provides a powerful method for modeling the dynamics of soft robots, offering advantages over traditional analytical approaches that require precise knowledge of the robot's structure, material properties, and other physical characteristics. Given the inherent complexity and non-linearity of these systems, extracting such details can be challenging. The mappings learned in one domain cannot be directly transferred to another domain with different physical properties. This challenge is particularly relevant for soft robots, as their materials gradually degrade over time. In this paper, we introduce a domain translation framework based on a conditional cycle generative adversarial network (CCGAN) to enable knowledge transfer from a source domain to a target domain. Specifically, we employ a dynamic learning approach to adapt a pose controller trained in a standard simulation environment to a domain with tenfold increased viscosity. Our model learns from input pressure signals conditioned on corresponding end-effector positions and orientations in both domains. We evaluate our approach through trajectory-tracking experiments across five distinct shapes and further assess its robustness under noise perturbations and periodicity tests. The results demonstrate that CCGAN-GP effectively facilitates cross-domain skill transfer, paving the way for more adaptable and generalizable soft robotic controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Conference on Robotic Systems and Applications</p></details> |
| **[Fully Spiking Actor-Critic Neural Network for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12038v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes a hybrid curriculum reinforcement learning (CRL) framework based on a fully spiking neural network (SNN) for 9-degree-of-freedom robotic arms performing target reaching and grasping tasks. To reduce network complexity and inference latency, the SNN architecture is simplified to include only an input and an output layer, which shows strong potential for resource-constrained environments. Building on the advantages of SNNs-high inference speed, low energy consumption, and spike-based biological plausibility, a temporal progress-partitioned curriculum strategy is integrated with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. Meanwhile, an energy consumption modeling framework is introduced to quantitatively compare the theoretical energy consumption between SNNs and conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). A dynamic two-stage reward adjustment mechanism and optimized observation space further improve learning efficiency and policy accuracy. Experiments on the Isaac Gym simulation platform demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance under realistic physical constraints. Comparative evaluations with conventional PPO and ANN baselines validate the scalability and energy efficiency of the proposed approach in dynamic robotic manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

This evolution requires robots to not only interpret high-level instructions and plan tasks but also perceive and adapt within dynamic environments. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) present a promising solution by combining visual understanding and language reasoning. However, existing VLM-based methods struggle with interactive exploration, accurate perception, and real-time plan adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose ExploreVLM, a novel closed-loop task planning framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The framework is built around a step-wise feedback mechanism that enables real-time plan adjustment and supports interactive exploration. At its core is a dual-stage task planner with self-reflection, enhanced by an object-centric spatial relation graph that provides structured, language-grounded scene representations to guide perception and planning. An execution validator supports the closed loop by verifying each action and triggering re-planning. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that ExploreVLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in exploration-centric tasks. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of the reflective planner and structured perception in achieving robust and efficient task execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Control of Legged Robots using Model Predictive Optimized Path Integral](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11917v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legged robots possess a unique ability to traverse rough terrains and navigate cluttered environments, making them well-suited for complex, real-world unstructured scenarios. However, such robots have not yet achieved the same level as seen in natural systems. Recently, sampling-based predictive controllers have demonstrated particularly promising results. This paper investigates a sampling-based model predictive strategy combining model predictive path integral (MPPI) with cross-entropy (CE) and covariance matrix adaptation (CMA) methods to generate real-time whole-body motions for legged robots across multiple scenarios. The results show that combining the benefits of MPPI, CE and CMA, namely using model predictive optimized path integral (MPOPI), demonstrates greater sample efficiency, enabling robots to attain superior locomotion results using fewer samples when compared to typical MPPI algorithms. Extensive simulation experiments in multiple scenarios on a quadruped robot show that MPOPI can be used as an anytime control strategy, increasing locomotion capabilities at each iteration.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 13 figures, Humanoid conference</p></details> |

However, effective navigation and situational awareness depend on users' prior knowledge of the environment, limiting the usefulness of these systems for exploring unfamiliar places. We explore how integrating location-aware LLM-based narrative capabilities into a mobile robot can support remote exploration. We developed a prototype system, called NarraGuide, that provides narrative guidance for users to explore and learn about a remote place through a dialogue-based interface. We deployed our prototype in a geology museum, where remote participants (n=20) used the robot to tour the museum. Our findings reveal how users perceived the robot's role, engaged in dialogue in the tour, and expressed preferences for bystander encountering. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLM-enabled robotic capabilities to deliver location-aware narrative guidance and enrich the experience of exploring remote environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crossing the Human-Robot Embodiment Gap with Sim-to-Real RL using One Human Demonstration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12609v3)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teaching robots dexterous manipulation skills often requires collecting hundreds of demonstrations using wearables or teleoperation, a process that is challenging to scale. Videos of human-object interactions are easier to collect and scale, but leveraging them directly for robot learning is difficult due to the lack of explicit action labels and human-robot embodiment differences. We propose Human2Sim2Robot, a novel real-to-sim-to-real framework for training dexterous manipulation policies using only one RGB-D video of a human demonstrating a task. Our method utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation to cross the embodiment gap without relying on wearables, teleoperation, or large-scale data collection. From the video, we extract: (1) the object pose trajectory to define an object-centric, embodiment-agnostic reward, and (2) the pre-manipulation hand pose to initialize and guide exploration during RL training. These components enable effective policy learning without any task-specific reward tuning. In the single human demo regime, Human2Sim2Robot outperforms object-aware replay by over 55% and imitation learning by over 68% on grasping, non-prehensile manipulation, and multi-step tasks.

Entertainment as a field prioritizes visuals and form, a principle that contrasts with the purely functional designs of most contemporary humanoid robots. Designing entertainment humanoid robots capable of fluid movement presents a number of unique challenges. In this paper, we present Kid Cosmo, a research platform designed for robust locomotion and life-like motion generation while imitating the look and mannerisms of its namesake character from Netflix's movie The Electric State. Kid Cosmo is a child-sized humanoid robot, standing 1.45 m tall and weighing 25 kg. It contains 28 degrees of freedom and primarily uses proprioceptive actuators, enabling torque-control walking and lifelike motion generation. Following worldwide showcases as part of the movie's press tour, we present the system architecture, challenges of a functional entertainment robot and unique solutions, and our initial findings on stability during simultaneous upper and lower body movement. We demonstrate the viability of performance-oriented humanoid robots that prioritize both character embodiment and technical functionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 14 figures, accepted by IEEE Humanoids 2025</p></details> |

Recent advances have enabled new capabilities in underwater movement, sensing, and interaction. However, these efforts are largely unidirectional, with biology guiding robotics while insights from robotics rarely feed back into biology. Here we propose a holistic, bidirectional framework that integrates biological principles, robotic implementation, and biological validation. We show that soft robots can serve as experimental tools to probe biological functions and even test evolutionary hypotheses. Their inherent compliance also allows them to outperform rigid systems in unstructured environments, supporting applications in marine exploration, manipulation, and medicine. Looking forward, we introduce bio-universal-inspired robotics, a paradigm that transcends species-specific mimicry by identifying convergent principles across species to inspire more adaptable designs. Despite rapid progress, challenges persist in material robustness, actuation efficiency, autonomy, and intelligence. By uniting biology and engineering, soft robots can advance ocean exploration and deepen scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe and Efficient Robot Action Planning in the Presence of Unconcerned Humans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13203v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a robot action planning scheme that provides an efficient and probabilistically safe plan for a robot interacting with an unconcerned human -- someone who is either unaware of the robot's presence or unwilling to engage in ensuring safety. The proposed scheme is predictive, meaning that the robot is required to predict human actions over a finite future horizon; such predictions are often inaccurate in real-world scenarios. One possible approach to reduce the uncertainties is to provide the robot with the capability of reasoning about the human's awareness of potential dangers. This paper discusses that by using a binary variable, so-called danger awareness coefficient, it is possible to differentiate between concerned and unconcerned humans, and provides a learning algorithm to determine this coefficient by observing human actions. Moreover, this paper argues how humans rely on predictions of other agents' future actions (including those of robots in human-robot interaction) in their decision-making. It also shows that ignoring this aspect in predicting human's future actions can significantly degrade the efficiency of the interaction, causing agents to deviate from their optimal paths. The proposed robot action planning scheme is verified and validated via extensive simulation and experimental studies on a LoCoBot WidowX-250.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a novel approach for transferring stepping motions from the user to the robot in real-time. Instead of directly replicating user foot poses, we retarget user steps to robot footstep locations, allowing the robot to utilize its own dynamics for locomotion, ensuring better balance and stability. Our method anticipates user footsteps to minimize delays between when the user initiates and completes a step and when the robot does it. The step estimates are continuously adapted to converge with the measured user references. Additionally, the system autonomously adjusts the robot's steps to account for its surrounding terrain, overcoming challenges posed by environmental mismatches between the user's flat-ground setup and the robot's uneven terrain. Experimental results on the humanoid robot Nadia demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE-RAS 24th International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids)</p></details> |
| **[Using Natural Language for Human-Robot Collaboration in the Real World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11759v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have a vision of a day when autonomous robots can collaborate with humans as assistants in performing complex tasks in the physical world. This vision includes that the robots will have the ability to communicate with their human collaborators using language that is natural to the humans. Traditional Interactive Task Learning (ITL) systems have some of this ability, but the language they can understand is very limited. The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides an opportunity to greatly improve the language understanding of robots, yet integrating the language abilities of LLMs with robots that operate in the real physical world is a challenging problem. In this chapter we first review briefly a few commercial robot products that work closely with humans, and discuss how they could be much better collaborators with robust language abilities. We then explore how an AI system with a cognitive agent that controls a physical robot at its core, interacts with both a human and an LLM, and accumulates situational knowledge through its experiences, can be a possible approach to reach that vision. We focus on three specific challenges of having the robot understand natural language, and present a simple proof-of-concept experiment using ChatGPT for each. Finally, we discuss what it will take to turn these simple experiments into an operational system where LLM-assisted language understanding is a part of an integrated robotic assistant that uses language to collaborate with humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Why Report Failed Interactions With Robots?! Towards Vignette-based Interaction Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10603v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although the quality of human-robot interactions has improved with the advent of LLMs, there are still various factors that cause systems to be sub-optimal when compared to human-human interactions. The nature and criticality of failures are often dependent on the context of the interaction and so cannot be generalized across the wide range of scenarios and experiments which have been implemented in HRI research. In this work we propose the use of a technique overlooked in the field of HRI, ethnographic vignettes, to clearly highlight these failures, particularly those that are rarely documented. We describe the methodology behind the process of writing vignettes and create our own based on our personal experiences with failures in HRI systems. We emphasize the strength of vignettes as the ability to communicate failures from a multi-disciplinary perspective, promote transparency about the capabilities of robots, and document unexpected behaviours which would otherwise be omitted from research reports. We encourage the use of vignettes to augment existing interaction evaluation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the workshop on Real-World HRI in Public and Private Spaces: Successes, Failures, and Lessons Learned (PubRob-Fails), held at the IEEE RO-MAN Conference, 2025. 6 pages</p></details> |

Robots, on the other hand, are not yet able to work similarly closely with humans and to effectively convey information when engaging in physical-social human-robot interaction (psHRI). This currently limits the potential of human-robot collaboration to solve real-world problems. This paper investigates how to establish clear and intuitive robot-to-human communication, while considering human comfort during psHRI. We approach this question from the perspective of a leader-follower dancing scenario, in which a full-body humanoid robot leads a human by signaling the next steps through a choice of communication modalities including haptic, visual, and audio signals. This is achieved through the development of a split whole-body control framework combining admittance and impedance control on the upper body, with position control on the lower body for balancing and stepping. Robot-led psHRI participant experiments allowed us to verify controller performance, as well as to build an understanding of what types of communication work better from the perspective of human partners, particularly in terms of perceived effectiveness and comfort.</p></details> | 21 pages, 16 figures |

However, current UGV datasets fall short in meeting the demands for advancing navigation and mapping techniques due to limitations in sensor configuration, time synchronization, ground truth, and scenario diversity. To address these challenges, we present i2Nav-Robot, a large-scale dataset designed for multi-sensor fusion navigation and mapping in indoor-outdoor environments. We integrate multi-modal sensors, including the newest front-view and 360-degree solid-state LiDARs, 4-dimensional (4D) radar, stereo cameras, odometer, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver, and inertial measurement units (IMU) on an omnidirectional wheeled robot. Accurate timestamps are obtained through both online hardware synchronization and offline calibration for all sensors. The dataset comprises ten larger-scale sequences covering diverse UGV operating scenarios, such as outdoor streets, and indoor parking lots, with a total length of about 17060 meters. High-frequency ground truth, with centimeter-level accuracy for position, is derived from post-processing integrated navigation methods using a navigation-grade IMU. The proposed i2Nav-Robot dataset is evaluated by more than ten open-sourced multi-sensor fusion systems, and it has proven to have superior data quality.</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures |

Deep neural networks have shown remarkable success in grasp synthesis by learning rich and abstract representations of objects. When deployed at the edge, these models can enable low-latency, low-power inference, making real-time grasping feasible in resource-constrained environments. This work implements Heatmap-Guided Grasp Detection, an end-to-end framework for the detection of 6-Dof grasp poses, on the GAP9 RISC-V System-on-Chip.

Traditional methods of manual inspection pose significant challenges, including safety risks, high cognitive demands, and potential inaccuracies due to human limitations. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotic technologies have opened new possibilities for safer, more efficient, and accurate inspection methodologies. Specifically, Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), leveraging robotic platforms equipped with advanced detection algorithms, promises significant improvements in inspection outcomes and reductions in human workload.

The default Data Distribution Service (DDS) communication stack in ROS 2 exhibits significant performance degradation over lossy wireless links. Despite the widespread use of ROS 2, the underlying causes of these wireless communication challenges remain unexplored. In this paper, we present the first in-depth network-layer analysis of ROS 2's DDS stack under wireless conditions with large payloads. We identify the following three key issues: excessive IP fragmentation, inefficient retransmission timing, and congestive buffer bursts. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight and fully compatible DDS optimization framework that tunes communication parameters based on link and payload characteristics. Our solution can be seamlessly applied through the standard ROS 2 application interface via simple XML-based QoS configuration, requiring no protocol modifications, no additional components, and virtually no integration efforts. Extensive experiments across various wireless scenarios demonstrate that our framework successfully delivers large payloads in conditions where existing DDS modes fail, while maintaining low end-to-end latency.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing platforms often lack dedicated support for magnetic materials, making them difficult to use for researchers at different expertise levels. This work introduces an open-source, user-friendly simulation interface using the Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA), specifically designed to model magnetic soft robots. The tool enables users to define material properties, apply magnetic fields, and observe resulting deformations in real time. By integrating intuitive controls and stress analysis capabilities, it aims to bridge the gap between theoretical modeling and practical design. Four benchmark models -- a beam, three- and four-finger grippers, and a butterfly -- demonstrate its functionality. The software's ease of use makes it accessible to both beginners and advanced researchers. Future improvements will refine accuracy through experimental validation and comparison with industry-standard finite element solvers, ensuring realistic and predictive simulations of magnetic soft robots.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose UniTracker, a three-stage training framework that enables robust and scalable motion tracking across a wide range of human behaviors. In the first stage, we train a teacher policy with privileged observations to generate high-quality actions. In the second stage, we introduce a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to model a universal student policy that can be deployed directly on real hardware. The CVAE structure allows the policy to learn a global latent representation of motion, enhancing generalization to unseen behaviors and addressing the limitations of standard MLP-based policies under partial observations. Unlike pure MLPs that suffer from drift in global attributes like orientation, our CVAE-student policy incorporates global intent during training by aligning a partial-observation prior to the full-observation encoder. In the third stage, we introduce a fast adaptation module that fine-tunes the universal policy on harder motion sequences that are difficult to track directly. This adaptation can be performed both for single sequences and in batch mode, further showcasing the flexibility and scalability of our approach. We evaluate UniTracker in both simulation and real-world settings using a Unitree G1 humanoid, demonstrating strong performance in motion diversity, tracking accuracy, and deployment robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>three...</summary><p>three-stage universal motion tracker for humanoid robots</p></details> |

Developing such tactile capabilities is important for numerous emerging applications that require robots to co-exist and interact closely with humans. Consequently, there has been growing interest in tactile sensing, leading to the development of various technologies, including piezoresistive and piezoelectric sensors, capacitive sensors, magnetic sensors, and optical tactile sensors. These diverse approaches utilise different transduction methods and materials to equip robots with distributed sensing capabilities, enabling more effective physical interactions. These advances have been supported in recent years by simulation tools that generate large-scale tactile datasets to support sensor designs and algorithms to interpret and improve the utility of tactile data. The integration of tactile sensing with other modalities, such as vision, as well as with action strategies for active tactile perception highlights the growing scope of this field. To further the transformative progress in tactile robotics, a holistic approach is essential. In this outlook article, we examine several challenges associated with the current state of the art in tactile robotics and explore potential solutions to inspire innovations across multiple domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, recycling and agriculture.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 figures, accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

However, existing fault-tolerant control methods exhibit significant oscillations during docking and separation, impacting system stability. To address this issue, we propose a novel fault-tolerant control reallocation method that adapts to an arbitrary number of modular robots and their assembly formations. The algorithm redistributes the expected collective force and torque required for MARS to individual units according to their moment arm relative to the center of MARS mass. Furthermore, we propose an agile trajectory planning method for MARS of arbitrary configurations, which is collision-avoiding and dynamically feasible. Our work represents the first comprehensive approach to enable fault-tolerant and collision avoidance flight for MARS. We validate our method through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved fault tolerance, enhanced trajectory tracking accuracy, and greater robustness in cluttered environments.

While task symmetry has emerged as a promising inductive bias to improve efficiency, most prior work is limited to isometric symmetries -- applying the same group transformation to all task objects across all timesteps. In this work, we explore non-isometric symmetries, applying multiple independent group transformations across spatial and temporal dimensions to relax these constraints. We introduce a novel formulation of the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) that incorporates the non-isometric symmetry structures, and propose a simple yet effective data augmentation method, Multi-Group Equivariance Augmentation (MEA). We integrate MEA with offline reinforcement learning to enhance sampling efficiency, and introduce a voxel-based visual representation that preserves translational equivariance. Extensive simulation and real-robot experiments across two manipulation domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visuomotor Grasping with World Models for Surgical Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11200v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grasping is a fundamental task in robot-assisted surgery (RAS), and automating it can reduce surgeon workload while enhancing efficiency, safety, and consistency beyond teleoperated systems. Most prior approaches rely on explicit object pose tracking or handcrafted visual features, limiting their generalization to novel objects, robustness to visual disturbances, and the ability to handle deformable objects. Visuomotor learning offers a promising alternative, but deploying it in RAS presents unique challenges, such as low signal-to-noise ratio in visual observations, demands for high safety and millimeter-level precision, as well as the complex surgical environment. This paper addresses three key challenges: (i) sim-to-real transfer of visuomotor policies to ex vivo surgical scenes, (ii) visuomotor learning using only a single stereo camera pair -- the standard RAS setup, and (iii) object-agnostic grasping with a single policy that generalizes to diverse, unseen surgical objects without retraining or task-specific models. We introduce Grasp Anything for Surgery V2 (GASv2), a visuomotor learning framework for surgical grasping. GASv2 leverages a world-model-based architecture and a surgical perception pipeline for visual observations, combined with a hybrid control system for safe execution. We train the policy in simulation using domain randomization for sim-to-real transfer and deploy it on a real robot in both phantom-based and ex vivo surgical settings, using only a single pair of endoscopic cameras. Extensive experiments show our policy achieves a 65% success rate in both settings, generalizes to unseen objects and grippers, and adapts to diverse disturbances, demonstrating strong performance, generality, and robustness.</p></details> |  |

We present MultiPlan+, a dataset of more than 18,000 annotated planning instances spanning 100 scenarios, including a subset of impractical cases to mitigate hallucination. To evaluate performance, we propose the Robot Planning Assessment Schema (RPAS), combining automated metrics with LLM-aided expert grading.

However, employing large robot fleets in manufacturing requires addressing challenges including collision-free movement in a shared workspace, effective multi-robot collaboration to manipulate and transport large payloads, complex task allocation due to coupled manufacturing processes, and spatial planning for parallel assembly and transportation of nested subassemblies. We propose a full algorithmic stack for large-scale multi-robot assembly planning that addresses these challenges and can synthesize construction plans for complex assemblies with thousands of parts in a matter of minutes. Our approach takes in a CAD-like product specification and automatically plans a full-stack assembly procedure for a group of robots to manufacture the product. We propose an algorithmic stack that comprises: (i) an iterative radial layout optimization procedure to define a global staging layout for the manufacturing facility, (ii) a graph-repair mixed-integer program formulation and a modified greedy task allocation algorithm to optimally allocate robots and robot sub-teams to assembly and transport tasks, (iii) a geometric heuristic and a hill-climbing algorithm to plan collaborative carrying configurations of robot sub-teams, and (iv) a distributed control policy that enables robots to execute the assembly motion plan collision-free. We also present an open-source multi-robot manufacturing simulator implemented in Julia as a resource to the research community, to test our algorithms and to facilitate multi-robot manufacturing research more broadly. Our empirical results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach by generating plans to manufacture a LEGO model of a Saturn V launch vehicle with 1845 parts, 306 subassemblies, and 250 robots in under three minutes on a standard laptop computer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repos...</summary><p>Repository: https://github.com/sisl/ConstructionBots.jl.

While action chunking is a promising paradigm for robotic manipulation, using RL to directly learn continuous action chunks in a stable and data-efficient manner remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces AC3 (Actor-Critic for Continuous Chunks), a novel RL framework that learns to generate high-dimensional, continuous action sequences. To make this learning process stable and data-efficient, AC3 incorporates targeted stabilization mechanisms for both the actor and the critic. First, to ensure reliable policy improvement, the actor is trained with an asymmetric update rule, learning exclusively from successful trajectories. Second, to enable effective value learning despite sparse rewards, the critic's update is stabilized using intra-chunk $n$-step returns and further enriched by a self-supervised module providing intrinsic rewards at anchor points aligned with each action chunk.

However, robotics is fundamentally a real-world problem, and evaluation for real-world applications has lagged behind in evaluating generalist policies. In this paper, we discuss challenges and desiderata in designing benchmarks for generalist robotic manipulation policies for the goal of sim-to-real policy transfer. We propose 1) utilizing high visual-fidelity simulation for improved sim-to-real transfer, 2) evaluating policies by systematically increasing task complexity and scenario perturbation to assess robustness, and 3) quantifying performance alignment between real-world performance and its simulation counterparts.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 Robot: Science and Systems (RSS) Workshop on Robot Evaluation for the Real World</p></details> |
| **[Safe Multi-Robotic Arm Interaction via 3D Convex Shapes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11791v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inter-robot collisions pose a significant safety risk when multiple robotic arms operate in close proximity. We present an online collision avoidance methodology leveraging 3D convex shape-based High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) to address this issue. While prior works focused on using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for human-robotic arm and single-arm collision avoidance, we explore the problem of collision avoidance between multiple robotic arms operating in a shared space. In our methodology, we utilize the proposed HOCBFs as centralized and decentralized safety filters. These safety filters are compatible with many nominal controllers and ensure safety without significantly restricting the robots' workspace. A key challenge in implementing these filters is the computational overhead caused by the large number of safety constraints and the computation of a Hessian matrix per constraint. We address this challenge by employing numerical differentiation methods to approximate computationally intensive terms. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through extensive simulation studies and real-world experiments with Franka Research 3 robotic arms.

Instead of directly controlling robots through Programming by Demonstration (PbD) or teleoperation, we propose giving instructions by interacting with GhostObjects-world-aligned, life-size virtual twins of physical objects-in augmented reality (AR). By direct manipulation of GhostObjects, users can precisely specify physical goals and spatial parameters, with features including real-world lasso selection of multiple objects and snapping back to default positions, enabling tasks beyond simple pick-and-place.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robotic Ultrasound-Guided Femoral Artery Reconstruction of Anatomically-Representative Phantoms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06795v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Femoral artery access is essential for numerous clinical procedures, including diagnostic angiography, therapeutic catheterization, and emergency interventions. Despite its critical role, successful vascular access remains challenging due to anatomical variability, overlying adipose tissue, and the need for precise ultrasound (US) guidance. Needle placement errors can result in severe complications, thereby limiting the procedure to highly skilled clinicians operating in controlled hospital environments. While robotic systems have shown promise in addressing these challenges through autonomous scanning and vessel reconstruction, clinical translation remains limited due to reliance on simplified phantom models that fail to capture human anatomical complexity. In this work, we present a method for autonomous robotic US scanning of bifurcated femoral arteries, and validate it on five vascular phantoms created from real patient computed tomography (CT) data. Additionally, we introduce a video-based deep learning US segmentation network tailored for vascular imaging, enabling improved 3D arterial reconstruction. The proposed network achieves a Dice score of 89.21% and an Intersection over Union of 80.54% on a new vascular dataset. The reconstructed artery centerline is evaluated against ground truth CT data, showing an average L2 error of 0.91+/-0.70 mm, with an average Hausdorff distance of 4.36+/-1.11mm. This study is the first to validate an autonomous robotic system for US scanning of the femoral artery on a diverse set of patient-specific phantoms, introducing a more advanced framework for evaluating robotic performance in vascular imaging and intervention.</p></details> |  |

While much has been done in the social and behavioural literature to characterise the features and consequences of subjective self-disclosure, little work has been done thus far to develop computational systems that are able to accurately model it. Even less work has been done that attempts to model specifically how human interactants self-disclose with robotic partners. It is becoming more pressing as we require social robots to work in conjunction with and establish relationships with humans in various social settings. In this paper, our aim is to develop a custom multimodal attention network based on models from the emotion recognition literature, training this model on a large self-collected self-disclosure video corpus, and constructing a new loss function, the scale preserving cross entropy loss, that improves upon both classification and regression versions of this problem. Our results show that the best performing model, trained with our novel loss function, achieves an F1 score of 0.83, an improvement of 0.48 from the best baseline model. This result makes significant headway in the aim of allowing social robots to pick up on an interaction partner's self-disclosures, an ability that will be essential in social robots with social cognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Task Execution Hierarchies for Redundant Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10780v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern robotic systems, such as mobile manipulators, humanoids, and aerial robots with arms, often possess high redundancy, enabling them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Managing this redundancy is key to achieving reliable and flexible behavior. A widely used approach is the Stack of Tasks (SoT), which organizes control objectives by priority within a unified framework. However, traditional SoTs are manually designed by experts, limiting their adaptability and accessibility. This paper introduces a novel framework that automatically learns both the hierarchy and parameters of a SoT from user-defined objectives. By combining Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Programming, the system discovers task priorities and control strategies without manual intervention. A cost function based on intuitive metrics such as precision, safety, and execution time guides the learning process. We validate our method through simulations and experiments on the mobile-YuMi platform, a dual-arm mobile manipulator with high redundancy. Results show that the learned SoTs enable the robot to dynamically adapt to changing environments and inputs, balancing competing objectives while maintaining robust task execution. This approach provides a general and user-friendly solution for redundancy management in complex robots, advancing human-centered robot programming and reducing the need for expert design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Episodic Memory Verbalization using Hierarchical Representations of Life-Long Robot Experience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17702v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Verbalization of robot experience, i.e., summarization of and question answering about a robot's past, is a crucial ability for improving human-robot interaction. Previous works applied rule-based systems or fine-tuned deep models to verbalize short (several-minute-long) streams of episodic data, limiting generalization and transferability. In our work, we apply large pretrained models to tackle this task with zero or few examples, and specifically focus on verbalizing life-long experiences. For this, we derive a tree-like data structure from episodic memory (EM), with lower levels representing raw perception and proprioception data, and higher levels abstracting events to natural language concepts. Given such a hierarchical representation built from the experience stream, we apply a large language model as an agent to interactively search the EM given a user's query, dynamically expanding (initially collapsed) tree nodes to find the relevant information. The approach keeps computational costs low even when scaling to months of robot experience data. We evaluate our method on simulated household robot data, human egocentric videos, and real-world robot recordings, demonstrating its flexibility and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Human...</summary><p>Humanoids 2025.

| **[Synthesis of Deep Neural Networks with Safe Robust Adaptive Control for Reliable Operation of Wheeled Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10634v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) can enable precise control while maintaining low computational costs by circumventing the need for dynamic modeling. However, the deployment of such black-box approaches remains challenging for heavy-duty wheeled mobile robots (WMRs), which are subject to strict international standards and prone to faults and disturbances. We designed a hierarchical control policy for heavy-duty WMRs, monitored by two safety layers with differing levels of authority. To this end, a DNN policy was trained and deployed as the primary control strategy, providing high-precision performance under nominal operating conditions. When external disturbances arise and reach a level of intensity such that the system performance falls below a predefined threshold, a low-level safety layer intervenes by deactivating the primary control policy and activating a model-free robust adaptive control (RAC) policy. This transition enables the system to continue operating while ensuring stability by effectively managing the inherent trade-off between system robustness and responsiveness. Regardless of the control policy in use, a high-level safety layer continuously monitors system performance during operation. It initiates a shutdown only when disturbances become sufficiently severe such that compensation is no longer viable and continued operation would jeopardize the system or its environment. The proposed synthesis of DNN and RAC policy guarantees uniform exponential stability of the entire WMR system while adhering to safety standards to some extent. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was further validated through real-time experiments using a 6,000 kg WMR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Embodied Agentic AI: Review and Classification of LLM- and VLM-Driven Robot Autonomy and Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05294v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or large behavior models (LBMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of robotic systems. This survey paper focuses on those works advancing towards agentic applications and architectures. This includes initial efforts exploring GPT-style interfaces to tooling, as well as more complex system where AI agents are coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[MLM: Learning Multi-task Loco-Manipulation Whole-Body Control for Quadruped Robot with Arm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10538v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-body loco-manipulation for quadruped robots with arm remains a challenging problem, particularly in achieving multi-task control. To address this, we propose MLM, a reinforcement learning framework driven by both real-world and simulation data. It enables a six-DoF robotic arm--equipped quadruped robot to perform whole-body loco-manipulation for multiple tasks autonomously or under human teleoperation. To address the problem of balancing multiple tasks during the learning of loco-manipulation, we introduce a trajectory library with an adaptive, curriculum-based sampling mechanism. This approach allows the policy to efficiently leverage real-world collected trajectories for learning multi-task loco-manipulation. To address deployment scenarios with only historical observations and to enhance the performance of policy execution across tasks with different spatial ranges, we propose a Trajectory-Velocity Prediction policy network. It predicts unobservable future trajectories and velocities. By leveraging extensive simulation data and curriculum-based rewards, our controller achieves whole-body behaviors in simulation and zero-shot transfer to real-world deployment. Ablation studies in simulation verify the necessity and effectiveness of our approach, while real-world experiments on the Go2 robot with an Airbot robotic arm demonstrate the policy's good performance in multi-task execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion Planning Diffusion: Learning and Adapting Robot Motion Planning with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19948v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of optimization-based robot motion planning algorithms is highly dependent on the initial solutions, commonly obtained by running a sampling-based planner to obtain a collision-free path. However, these methods can be slow in high-dimensional and complex scenes and produce non-smooth solutions. Given previously solved path-planning problems, it is highly desirable to learn their distribution and use it as a prior for new similar problems. Several works propose utilizing this prior to bootstrap the motion planning problem, either by sampling initial solutions from it, or using its distribution in a maximum-a-posterior formulation for trajectory optimization. In this work, we introduce Motion Planning Diffusion (MPD), an algorithm that learns trajectory distribution priors with diffusion models. These generative models have shown increasing success in encoding multimodal data and have desirable properties for gradient-based motion planning, such as cost guidance. Given a motion planning problem, we construct a cost function and sample from the posterior distribution using the learned prior combined with the cost function gradients during the denoising process. Instead of learning the prior on all trajectory waypoints, we propose learning a lower-dimensional representation of a trajectory using linear motion primitives, particularly B-spline curves. This parametrization guarantees that the generated trajectory is smooth, can be interpolated at higher frequencies, and needs fewer parameters than a dense waypoint representation. We demonstrate the results of our method ranging from simple 2D to more complex tasks using a 7-dof robot arm manipulator. In addition to learning from simulated data, we also use human demonstrations on a real-world pick-and-place task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Generic Robot Skill Implementation Using Object Oriented Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10497v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing robotic algorithms and integrating a robotic subsystem into a larger system can be a difficult task. Particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) where robotics expertise is lacking, implementing, maintaining and developing robotic systems can be a challenge. As a result, many companies rely on external expertise through system integrators, which, in some cases, can lead to vendor lock-in and external dependency. In the academic research on intelligent manufacturing systems, robots play a critical role in the design of robust autonomous systems. Similar challenges are faced by researchers who want to use robotic systems as a component in a larger smart system, without having to deal with the complexity and vastness of the robot interfaces in detail. In this paper, we propose a software framework that reduces the effort required to deploy a working robotic system. The focus is solely on providing a concept for simplifying the different interfaces of a modern robot system and using an abstraction layer for different manufacturers and models. The Python programming language is used to implement a prototype of the concept. The target system is a bin-picking cell containing a Yaskawa Motoman GP4.</p></details> | <details><summary>34th ...</summary><p>34th International Conference on Robotics in Alpe-Adria-Danube Region (RAAD 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Split Covariance Intersection Filter Based Visual Localization With Accurate AprilTag Map For Warehouse Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17879v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient localization with conveniently-established map is the fundamental requirement for mobile robot operation in warehouse environments. An accurate AprilTag map can be conveniently established with the help of LiDAR-based SLAM. It is true that a LiDAR-based system is usually not commercially competitive in contrast with a vision-based system, yet fortunately for warehouse applications, only a single LiDAR-based SLAM system is needed to establish an accurate AprilTag map, whereas a large amount of visual localization systems can share this established AprilTag map for their own operations. Therefore, the cost of a LiDAR-based SLAM system is actually shared by the large amount of visual localization systems, and turns to be acceptable and even negligible for practical warehouse applications. Once an accurate AprilTag map is available, visual localization is realized as recursive estimation that fuses AprilTag measurements (i.e. AprilTag detection results) and robot motion data. AprilTag measurements may be nonlinear partial measurements; this can be handled by the well-known extended Kalman filter (EKF) in the spirit of local linearization. AprilTag measurements tend to have temporal correlation as well; however, this cannot be reasonably handled by the EKF. The split covariance intersection filter (Split CIF) is adopted to handle temporal correlation among AprilTag measurements. The Split CIF (in the spirit of local linearization) can also handle AprilTag nonlinear partial measurements. The Split CIF based visual localization system incorporates a measurement adaptive mechanism to handle outliers in AprilTag measurements and adopts a dynamic initialization mechanism to address the kidnapping problem. A comparative study in real warehouse environments demonstrates the potential and advantage of the Split CIF based visual localization solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traversability analysis with vision and terrain probing for safe legged robot navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00334v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by human behavior when traveling over unknown terrain, this study proposes the use of probing strategies and integrates them into a traversability analysis framework to address safe navigation on unknown rough terrain. Our framework integrates collapsibility information into our existing traversability analysis, as vision and geometric information alone could be misled by unpredictable non-rigid terrains such as soft soil, bush area, or water puddles. With the new traversability analysis framework, our robot has a more comprehensive assessment of unpredictable terrain, which is critical for its safety in outdoor environments. The pipeline first identifies the terrain's geometric and semantic properties using an RGB-D camera and desired probing locations on questionable terrains. These regions are probed using a force sensor to determine the risk of terrain collapsing when the robot steps over it. This risk is formulated as a collapsibility metric, which estimates an unpredictable region's ground collapsibility. Thereafter, the collapsibility metric, together with geometric and semantic spatial data, is combined and analyzed to produce global and local traversability grid maps. These traversability grid maps tell the robot whether it is safe to step over different regions of the map. The grid maps are then utilized to generate optimal paths for the robot to safely navigate to its goal. Our approach has been successfully verified on a quadrupedal robot in both simulation and real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time Digital Double Framework to Predict Collapsible Terrains for Legged Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09508v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the digital twinning systems, a novel real-time digital double framework is developed to enhance robot perception of the terrain conditions. Based on the very same physical model and motion control, this work exploits the use of such simulated digital double synchronized with a real robot to capture and extract discrepancy information between the two systems, which provides high dimensional cues in multiple physical quantities to represent differences between the modelled and the real world. Soft, non-rigid terrains cause common failures in legged locomotion, whereby visual perception solely is insufficient in estimating such physical properties of terrains. We used digital double to develop the estimation of the collapsibility, which addressed this issue through physical interactions during dynamic walking. The discrepancy in sensory measurements between the real robot and its digital double are used as input of a learning-based algorithm for terrain collapsibility analysis. Although trained only in simulation, the learned model can perform collapsibility estimation successfully in both simulation and real world. Our evaluation of results showed the generalization to different scenarios and the advantages of the digital double to reliably detect nuances in ground conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS).

While most existing methods typically employ single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms for a single humanoid robot or MARL algorithms for multi-robot system tasks, we propose a distinct paradigm: applying cooperative-heterogeneous MARL to optimize locomotion for a single humanoid robot. The proposed method, multi-agent reinforcement learning for single humanoid locomotion (MASH), treats each limb (legs and arms) as an independent agent that explores the robot's action space while sharing a global critic for cooperative learning. Experiments demonstrate that MASH accelerates training convergence and improves whole-body cooperation ability, outperforming conventional single-agent reinforcement learning methods. This work advances the integration of MARL into single-humanoid-robot control, offering new insights into efficient locomotion strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Super LiDAR Reflectance for Robotic Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10398v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventionally, human intuition often defines vision as a modality of passive optical sensing, while active optical sensing is typically regarded as measuring rather than the default modality of vision. However, the situation now changes: sensor technologies and data-driven paradigms empower active optical sensing to redefine the boundaries of vision, ushering in a new era of active vision. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors capture reflectance from object surfaces, which remains invariant under varying illumination conditions, showcasing significant potential in robotic perception tasks such as detection, recognition, segmentation, and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). These applications often rely on dense sensing capabilities, typically achieved by high-resolution, expensive LiDAR sensors. A key challenge with low-cost LiDARs lies in the sparsity of scan data, which limits their broader application. To address this limitation, this work introduces an innovative framework for generating dense LiDAR reflectance images from sparse data, leveraging the unique attributes of non-repeating scanning LiDAR (NRS-LiDAR). We tackle critical challenges, including reflectance calibration and the transition from static to dynamic scene domains, facilitating the reconstruction of dense reflectance images in real-world settings. The key contributions of this work include a comprehensive dataset for LiDAR reflectance image densification, a densification network tailored for NRS-LiDAR, and diverse applications such as loop closure and traffic lane detection using the generated dense reflectance images.</p></details> |  |

Our approach enables mobile robots to efficiently balance exploration and exploitation by modeling normalized signal strength as a surrogate probability of source location. Building on Behavioral Entropy(BE) with Prelec's probability weighting function, we define an objective function that adapts robot behavior from risk-averse to risk-seeking based on signal reliability and mission urgency. The framework provides theoretical convergence guarantees under unimodal signal assumptions and practical stability under bounded disturbances. Experimental validation across DARPA SubT and multi-room scenarios demonstrates that BEASST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 15% reduction in path length and 20% faster source localization through intelligent uncertainty-driven navigation that dynamically transitions between aggressive pursuit and cautious exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReconVLA: Reconstructive Vision-Language-Action Model as Effective Robot Perceiver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10333v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have enabled robotic agents to integrate multimodal understanding with action execution. However, our empirical analysis reveals that current VLAs struggle to allocate visual attention to target regions. Instead, visual attention is always dispersed. To guide the visual attention grounding on the correct target, we propose ReconVLA, a reconstructive VLA model with an implicit grounding paradigm. Conditioned on the model's visual outputs, a diffusion transformer aims to reconstruct the gaze region of the image, which corresponds to the target manipulated objects. This process prompts the VLA model to learn fine-grained representations and accurately allocate visual attention, thus effectively leveraging task-specific visual information and conducting precise manipulation. Moreover, we curate a large-scale pretraining dataset comprising over 100k trajectories and 2 million data samples from open-source robotic datasets, further boosting the model's generalization in visual reconstruction. Extensive experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate the superiority of our implicit grounding method, showcasing its capabilities of precise manipulation and generalization.

| **[Leveraging OS-Level Primitives for Robotic Action Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10259v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end imitation learning frameworks (e.g., VLA) are increasingly prominent in robotics, as they enable rapid task transfer by learning directly from perception to control, eliminating the need for complex hand-crafted features. However, even when employing SOTA VLA-based models, they still exhibit limited generalization capabilities and suboptimal action efficiency, due to the constraints imposed by insufficient robotic training datasets. In addition to addressing this problem using model-based approaches, we observe that robotic action slices, which consist of contiguous action steps, exhibit strong analogies to the time slices of threads in traditional operating systems. This insight presents a novel opportunity to tackle the problem at the system level. In this paper, we propose AMS, a robot action management system enhanced with OS-level primitives like exception, context switch and record-and-replay, that improves both execution efficiency and success rates of robotic tasks. AMS first introduces action exception, which facilitates the immediate interruption of robotic actions to prevent error propagation. Secondly, AMS proposes action context, which eliminates redundant computations for VLA-based models, thereby accelerating execution efficiency in robotic actions. Finally, AMS leverages action replay to facilitate repetitive or similar robotic tasks without the need for re-training efforts. We implement AMS in both an emulated environment and on a real robot platform. The evaluation results demonstrate that AMS significantly enhances the model's generalization ability and action efficiency, achieving task success rate improvements ranging from 7x to 24x and saving end-to-end execution time ranging from 29% to 74% compared to existing robotic system without AMS support.</p></details> |  |

Application of neuromorphic computing in robotic locomotion research have largely focused on Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) for bionics robotic control algorithms - inspired from neural circuits governing the collaboration of the limb muscles in animal movement. Implementation of artificial CPGs on neuromorphic hardware platforms can potentially enable adaptive and energy-efficient edge robotics applications in resource constrained environments. However, underlying rewiring mechanisms in CPG for gait emergence process is not well understood. This work addresses the missing gap in literature pertaining to CPG plasticity and underscores the critical homeostatic functionality of astrocytes - a cellular component in the brain that is believed to play a major role in multiple brain functions. This paper introduces an astrocyte regulated Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based CPG for learning locomotion gait through Reward-Modulated STDP for quadruped robots, where the astrocytes help build inhibitory connections among the artificial motor neurons in different limbs. The SNN-based CPG is simulated on a multi-object physics simulation platform resulting in the emergence of a trotting gait while running the robot on flat ground. $23.3\times$ computational power savings is observed in comparison to a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning based robot control algorithm. Such a neuroscience-algorithm co-design approach can potentially enable a quantum leap in the functionality of neuromorphic systems incorporating glial cell functionality.</p></details> |  |
