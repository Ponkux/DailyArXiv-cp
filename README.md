| **[EmbodiedSplat: Personalized Real-to-Sim-to-Real Navigation with Gaussian Splats from a Mobile Device](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17430v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of Embodied AI predominantly relies on simulation for training and evaluation, often using either fully synthetic environments that lack photorealism or high-fidelity real-world reconstructions captured with expensive hardware. As a result, sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge. In this paper, we introduce EmbodiedSplat, a novel approach that personalizes policy training by efficiently capturing the deployment environment and fine-tuning policies within the reconstructed scenes. Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and the Habitat-Sim simulator to bridge the gap between realistic scene capture and effective training environments. Using iPhone-captured deployment scenes, we reconstruct meshes via GS, enabling training in settings that closely approximate real-world conditions. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, pre-training datasets, and mesh reconstruction techniques, evaluating their impact on sim-to-real predictivity in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that agents fine-tuned with EmbodiedSplat outperform both zero-shot baselines pre-trained on large-scale real-world datasets (HM3D) and synthetically generated datasets (HSSD), achieving absolute success rate improvements of 20\% and 40\% on real-world Image Navigation task. Moreover, our approach yields a high sim-vs-real correlation (0.87--0.97) for the reconstructed meshes, underscoring its effectiveness in adapting policies to diverse environments with minimal effort.

| **[Elevating Visual Perception in Multimodal LLMs with Auxiliary Embedding Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09585v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, the standard practice for developing MLLMs is to feed features from vision encoder(s) into the LLM and train with natural language supervision. This approach often causes models to lean towards language comprehension and undermine the rich visual perception signals present in the data, which are critical for tasks involving spatial reasoning in the domain of embodied AI and robotics. Is it possible to optimize both at the same time? In this work, we propose VisPer-LM, the first approach that infuses visual perception knowledge from expert vision encoders into the LLM's (of an MLLM) hidden representations. We start by investigating MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Given this insight, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next (text) token prediction. Moreover, through extensive probing, we observe improved visual representation quality due to embedding optimization, underscoring the effectiveness of our probing setup. We demonstrate that our VisPer-LM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. In particular, VisPer-LM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/visper_lm/</p></details> |
| **[Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16176v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic Trajectories (ACDC), an autonomous drone cinematography system driven by natural language communication between human directors and drones. The main limitation of previous drone cinematography workflows is that they require manual selection of waypoints and view angles based on predefined human intent, which is labor-intensive and yields inconsistent performance. In this paper, we propose employing large language models (LLMs) and vision foundation models (VFMs) to convert free-form natural language prompts directly into executable indoor UAV video tours. Specifically, our method comprises a vision-language retrieval pipeline for initial waypoint selection, a preference-based Bayesian optimization framework that refines poses using aesthetic feedback, and a motion planner that generates safe quadrotor trajectories. We validate ACDC through both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating that it robustly produces professional-quality footage across diverse indoor scenes without requiring expertise in robotics or cinematography. These results highlight the potential of embodied AI agents to close the loop from open-vocabulary dialogue to real-world autonomous aerial cinematography.</p></details> |  |
| **[OptiScene: LLM-driven Indoor Scene Layout Generation via Scaled Human-aligned Data Synthesis and Multi-Stage Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07570v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emulating Human-like Adaptive Vision for Efficient and Flexible Machine Visual Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15333v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations, and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning, enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17 benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition, fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient, flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition. Code is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/AdaptiveNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[ThinkAct: Vision-Language-Action Reasoning via Reinforced Visual Latent Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16815v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Embodied Arena: A Comprehensive, Unified, and Evolving Evaluation Platform for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15273v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI development significantly lags behind large foundation models due to three critical challenges: (1) lack of systematic understanding of core capabilities needed for Embodied AI, making research lack clear objectives; (2) absence of unified and standardized evaluation systems, rendering cross-benchmark evaluation infeasible; and (3) underdeveloped automated and scalable acquisition methods for embodied data, creating critical bottlenecks for model scaling. To address these obstacles, we present Embodied Arena, a comprehensive, unified, and evolving evaluation platform for Embodied AI. Our platform establishes a systematic embodied capability taxonomy spanning three levels (perception, reasoning, task execution), seven core capabilities, and 25 fine-grained dimensions, enabling unified evaluation with systematic research objectives. We introduce a standardized evaluation system built upon unified infrastructure supporting flexible integration of 22 diverse benchmarks across three domains (2D/3D Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) and 30+ advanced models from 20+ worldwide institutes. Additionally, we develop a novel LLM-driven automated generation pipeline ensuring scalable embodied evaluation data with continuous evolution for diversity and comprehensiveness. Embodied Arena publishes three real-time leaderboards (Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) with dual perspectives (benchmark view and capability view), providing comprehensive overviews of advanced model capabilities. Especially, we present nine findings summarized from the evaluation results on the leaderboards of Embodied Arena. This helps to establish clear research veins and pinpoint critical research problems, thereby driving forward progress in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, Embodied Arena Technical Report</p></details> |
| **[RealMirror: A Comprehensive, Open-Source Vision-Language-Action Platform for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14687v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emerging field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for humanoid robots faces several fundamental challenges, including the high cost of data acquisition, the lack of a standardized benchmark, and the significant gap between simulation and the real world. To overcome these obstacles, we propose RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

| **[Embodied Navigation Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12129v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation is a fundamental capability in embodied AI, representing the intelligence required to perceive and interact within physical environments following language instructions. Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks. Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pku-epic.github.io/NavFoM-Web/</p></details> |
| **[PANORAMA: The Rise of Omnidirectional Vision in the Embodied AI Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12989v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omnidirectional vision, using 360-degree vision to understand the environment, has become increasingly critical across domains like robotics, industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Compared to traditional pinhole vision, omnidirectional vision provides holistic environmental awareness, significantly enhancing the completeness of scene perception and the reliability of decision-making. However, foundational research in this area has historically lagged behind traditional pinhole vision. This talk presents an emerging trend in the embodied AI era: the rapid development of omnidirectional vision, driven by growing industrial demand and academic interest. We highlight recent breakthroughs in omnidirectional generation, omnidirectional perception, omnidirectional understanding, and related datasets. Drawing on insights from both academia and industry, we propose an ideal panoramic system architecture in the embodied AI era, PANORAMA, which consists of four key subsystems. Moreover, we offer in-depth opinions related to emerging trends and cross-community impacts at the intersection of panoramic vision and embodied AI, along with the future roadmap and open challenges. This overview synthesizes state-of-the-art advancements and outlines challenges and opportunities for future research in building robust, general-purpose omnidirectional AI systems in the embodied AI era.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper presents a draft overview of the emerging field of omnidirectional vision in the context of embodied AI</p></details> |
| **[Learning Precise Affordances from Egocentric Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10123v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Affordance, defined as the potential actions that an object offers, is crucial for embodied AI agents. For example, such knowledge directs an agent to grasp a knife by the handle for cutting or by the blade for safe handover. While existing approaches have made notable progress, affordance research still faces three key challenges: data scarcity, poor generalization, and real-world deployment. Specifically, there is a lack of large-scale affordance datasets with precise segmentation maps, existing models struggle to generalize across different domains or novel object and affordance classes, and little work demonstrates deployability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address these issues by proposing a complete affordance learning system that (1) takes in egocentric videos and outputs precise affordance annotations without human labeling, (2) leverages geometric information and vision foundation models to improve generalization, and (3) introduces a framework that facilitates affordance-oriented robotic manipulation such as tool grasping and robot-to-human tool handover. Experimental results show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art by 13.8% in mIoU, and the framework achieves 77.1% successful grasping among 179 trials, including evaluations on seen, unseen classes, and cluttered scenes.

| **[Integrating Prior Observations for Incremental 3D Scene Graph Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11895v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D semantic scene graphs (3DSSG) provide compact structured representations of environments by explicitly modeling objects, attributes, and relationships. While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world, incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g., CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for complex, real-world environments. The full source code of the presented architecture will be made available at https://github.com/m4renz/incremental-scene-graph-prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 24th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA'25)</p></details> |
| **[INGRID: Intelligent Generative Robotic Design Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03842v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has accelerated progress in embodied artificial intelligence, yet current approaches remain constrained by existing robotic architectures, particularly serial mechanisms. This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware, potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[RoboBrain 2.0 Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02029v5)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce RoboBrain 2.0, our latest generation of embodied vision-language foundation models, designed to unify perception, reasoning, and planning for complex embodied tasks in physical environments. It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents.

| **[Nav-R1: Reasoning and Navigation in Embodied Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10884v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied navigation requires agents to integrate perception, reasoning, and action for robust interaction in complex 3D environments. Existing approaches often suffer from incoherent and unstable reasoning traces that hinder generalization across diverse environments, and difficulty balancing long-horizon semantic reasoning with low-latency control for real-time navigation. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-R1, an embodied foundation model that unifies reasoning in embodied environments. We first construct Nav-CoT-110K, a large-scale dataset of step-by-step Chains-of-Thought (CoT) for embodied tasks, which enables cold-start initialization with structured reasoning. Building on this foundation, we design a GRPO-based reinforcement learning framework with three complementary rewards: format, understanding, and navigation, to improve structural adherence, semantic grounding, and path fidelity. Furthermore, we introduce a Fast-in-Slow reasoning paradigm, decoupling deliberate semantic reasoning from low-latency reactive control for efficient yet coherent navigation. Extensive evaluations on embodied AI benchmarks demonstrate that Nav-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, with over 8% average improvement in reasoning and navigation performance. Real-world deployment on a mobile robot further validates its robustness under limited onboard resources. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/Nav-R1.

| **[InternScenes: A Large-scale Simulatable Indoor Scene Dataset with Realistic Layouts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10813v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of Embodied AI heavily relies on large-scale, simulatable 3D scene datasets characterized by scene diversity and realistic layouts. However, existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity, sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528v6)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p></details> | CoRL 2025 |
| **[Boosting Embodied AI Agents through Perception-Generation Disaggregation and Asynchronous Pipeline Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09560v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems operate in dynamic environments, requiring seamless integration of perception and generation modules to process high-frequency input and output demands. Traditional sequential computation patterns, while effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by 2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and providing high throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attribution Regularization for Multimodal Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02359v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal machine learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for integrating information from multiple modalities to enhance learning and decision-making processes. However, it is commonly observed that unimodal models outperform multimodal models, despite the latter having access to richer information. Additionally, the influence of a single modality often dominates the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions. The focus of this project lies in the video-audio domain, although the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved. By leveraging this regularization term, the proposed approach aims to mitigate the issue of unimodal dominance and improve the performance of multimodal machine learning systems. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed technique will be assessed. The findings of this research project have the potential to significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal machine learning and facilitate its application in various domains, including multimedia analysis, human-computer interaction, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |

This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce ViCA (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant)-322K, a diverse dataset of 322,003 QA pairs from real-world indoor videos (ARKitScenes, ScanNet, ScanNet++), offering supervision for 3D metadata-grounded queries and video-based complex reasoning. Second, we develop ViCA-7B, fine-tuned on ViCA-322K, which achieves new state-of-the-art on all eight VSI-Bench tasks, outperforming existing models, including larger ones (e.g., +26.1 on Absolute Distance). For interpretability, we present ViCA-Thinking-2.68K, a dataset with explicit reasoning chains, and fine-tune ViCA-7B to create ViCA-7B-Thinking, a model that articulates its spatial reasoning. Our work highlights the importance of targeted data and suggests paths for improved temporal-spatial modeling. We release all resources to foster research in robust visuospatial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception, foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation, and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1 consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in both task success rate and generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://aopolin-lv.github.io/F1-VLA/</p></details> |
| **[LatticeWorld: A Multimodal Large Language Model-Empowered Framework for Interactive Complex World Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05263v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents, featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity.

| **[Generative World Explorer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11844v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |

Prior work has addressed this issue by creating spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data. Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view environments.</p></details> |  |

These challenges expose a pressing need for machine learning models capable of swift, context-aware adaptation while balancing model generalization and personalization. Here, two methods emerge as suitable candidates, each offering parts of these capabilities: multi-modal multi-task foundation models (M3T-FMs) provide a pathway toward generalization across tasks and modalities, whereas federated learning (FL) offers the infrastructure for distributed, privacy-preserving model updates and user-level model personalization. However, when used in isolation, each of these approaches falls short of meeting the complex and diverse capability requirements of real-world embodied AI environments. In this vision paper, we introduce multi-modal multi-task federated foundation models (M3T-FFMs) for embodied AI, a new paradigm that unifies the strengths of M3T-FMs with the privacy-preserving distributed training nature of FL, enabling intelligent systems at the wireless edge. We collect critical deployment dimensions of M3T-FFMs in embodied AI ecosystems under a unified framework, which we name "EMBODY": Embodiment heterogeneity, Modality richness and imbalance, Bandwidth and compute constraints, On-device continual learning, Distributed control and autonomy, and Yielding safety, privacy, and personalization. For each, we identify concrete challenges and envision actionable research directions. We also present an evaluation framework for deploying M3T-FFMs in embodied AI systems, along with the associated trade-offs. Finally, we present a prototype implementation of M3T-FFMs and evaluate their energy and latency performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication in IEEE Internet of Things Magazine, 2025</p></details> |

We propose an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches, our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout). The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[HLG: Comprehensive 3D Room Construction via Hierarchical Layout Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17832v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic 3D indoor scene generation is crucial for virtual reality, interior design, embodied intelligence, and scene understanding. While existing methods have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication to encourage future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[World Model Implanting for Test-time Adaptation of Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03956v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models, the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability. In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied AI: Emerging Risks and Opportunities for Policy Action](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00117v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of embodied AI (EAI) is rapidly advancing. Unlike virtual AI, EAI systems can exist in, learn from, reason about, and act in the physical world. With recent advances in AI models and hardware, EAI systems are becoming increasingly capable across wider operational domains. While EAI systems can offer many benefits, they also pose significant risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, as well as economic and societal disruption. These risks require urgent attention from policymakers, as existing policies governing industrial robots and autonomous vehicles are insufficient to address the full range of concerns EAI systems present. To help address this issue, this paper makes three contributions. First, we provide a taxonomy of the physical, informational, economic, and social risks EAI systems pose. Second, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to assess how existing frameworks address these risks and to identify critical gaps. We conclude by offering policy recommendations for the safe and beneficial deployment of EAI systems, such as mandatory testing and certification schemes, clarified liability frameworks, and strategies to manage EAI's potentially transformative economic and societal impacts.</p></details> |  |
| **[ANNIE: Be Careful of Your Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03383v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI) robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety, how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries; (2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with 2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3) ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era.

Embodied intelligence focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the physical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only advanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract cognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest. Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the integration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their complementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in intelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and internal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment. By synthesizing current progress and identifying open challenges, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the path toward more capable and generalizable embodied AI systems.

Existing omnidirectional methods achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the \textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories (\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional SLAM methods struggle to meet the demands of high-quality scene reconstruction, and Gaussian SLAM systems, despite their rapid rendering and high-quality mapping capabilities, lack effective pose optimization methods and face challenges in geometric reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system that employs an opacity radiance field as the scene representation to enhance geometric mapping performance. After initial pose estimation, we apply global adjustment to optimize camera poses and sparse point cloud, ensuring robust tracking of our approach. Additionally, we maintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and introduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene representation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify level sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians. Results across various real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI.

| **[RobotxR1: Enabling Embodied Robotic Intelligence on Large Language Models through Closed-Loop Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03238v2)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future robotic systems operating in real-world environments will require on-board embodied intelligence without continuous cloud connection, balancing capabilities with constraints on computational power and memory. This work presents an extension of the R1-zero approach, which enables the usage of low parameter-count Large Language Models (LLMs) in the robotic domain. The R1-Zero approach was originally developed to enable mathematical reasoning in LLMs using static datasets. We extend it to the robotics domain through integration in a closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. This extension enhances reasoning in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) settings without relying solely on distillation of large models through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We show that small-scale LLMs can achieve effective reasoning performance by learning through closed-loop interaction with their environment, which enables tasks that previously required significantly larger models. In an autonomous driving setting, a performance gain of 20.2%-points over the SFT-based baseline is observed with a Qwen2.5-1.5B model. Using the proposed training procedure, Qwen2.5-3B achieves a 63.3% control adaptability score, surpassing the 58.5% obtained by the much larger, cloud-bound GPT-4o. These results highlight that practical, on-board deployment of small LLMs is not only feasible but can outperform larger models if trained through environmental feedback, underscoring the importance of an interactive learning framework for robotic Embodied AI, one grounded in practical experience rather than static supervision.</p></details> |  |

This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |

Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lanlan96.github.io/BoxFusion/</p></details> |

Closely packed objects cause inevitable occlusions, making safe action generation particularly difficult. Under such partial observability, effective policies must not only generalize across diverse objects and layouts but also reason about occlusion to avoid collisions. However, collecting large-scale real-world data for this task remains prohibitively expensive, leaving this problem largely unsolved. In this paper, we introduce FetchBot, a sim-to-real framework for this challenge. We first curate a large-scale synthetic dataset featuring 1M diverse scenes and 500k representative demonstrations. Based on this dataset, FetchBot employs a depth-conditioned method for action generation, which leverages structural cues to enable robust obstacle-aware action planning. However, depth is perfect in simulation but noisy in real-world environments. To address this sim-to-real gap, FetchBot predicts depth from RGB inputs using a foundation model and integrates local occupancy prediction as a pre-training task, providing a generalizable latent representation for sim-to-real transfer. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the strong zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, effective clutter handling, and adaptability to novel scenarios. In cluttered environments, it achieves an average real-world success rate of 89.95%, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, FetchBot demonstrates excellent robustness in challenging cases, such as fetching transparent, reflective, and irregular objects, highlighting its practical value.</p></details> | <details><summary>9th A...</summary><p>9th Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025, Oral)</p></details> |

In this work, we address the challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture. Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval; (ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of 3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass; (iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation, potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks.

However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution, and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands. This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500 complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot. We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.</p></details> |  |

Firstly, it chronicles the developmental trajectory of VLA architectures. Subsequently, we conduct a detailed analysis of current research across 5 critical dimensions: VLA model structures, training datasets, pre-training methods, post-training methods, and model evaluation. Finally, we synthesize key challenges in VLA development and real-world deployment, while outlining promising future research directions.</p></details> | in Chinese language |

To formalize this setting, we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by both LLM-based and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages + 2 pages references + 7 pages appendix</p></details> |

However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity, offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of visual-language models across reasoning levels.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm, offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action gap in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Embod...</summary><p>Embodied-R1 technical report</p></details> |

In this survey, we first systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases, Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than 180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust, high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation of autonomous embodied systems.</p></details> |  |

However, standardized benchmarks for evaluating robotic athletic performance in real-world settings and in direct comparison to humans remain scarce. We present Switch4EAI(Switch-for-Embodied-AI), a low-cost and easily deployable pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games to evaluate whole-body robot control policies. Using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch as a representative example, our system captures, reconstructs, and retargets in-game choreography for robotic execution. We validate the system on a Unitree G1 humanoid with an open-source whole-body controller, establishing a quantitative baseline for the robot's performance against a human player. In the paper, we discuss these results, which demonstrate the feasibility of using commercial games platform as physically grounded benchmarks and motivate future work to for benchmarking embodied AI.</p></details> | Workshop Submission |
| **[Virtuous Machines: Towards Artificial General Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13421v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness, executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments, accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored. It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and the attribution of scientific credit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied Image Quality Assessment for Robotic Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18774v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Quality Assessment (IQA) of User-Generated Content (UGC) is a critical technique for human Quality of Experience (QoE). However, does the the image quality of Robot-Generated Content (RGC) demonstrate traits consistent with the Moravec paradox, potentially conflicting with human perceptual norms? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the perception mechanism of embodied robots for image quality. We propose the first Embodied Preference Database (EPD), which contains 12,500 distorted image annotations. We establish assessment metrics based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, there is a gap between UGC and RGC. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-scale Attention Embodied Image Quality Assessment called MA-EIQA. For the proposed EPD dataset, this is the first no-reference IQA model designed for embodied robot. Finally, the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Jianbo-maker/EPD_benchmark.</p></details> |  |

FormCoach transforms a simple camera into an always-on, interactive AI training partner, capable of spotting subtle form errors and delivering tailored corrections in real time, leveraging vision-language models (VLMs). We showcase this capability through a web interface and benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs on a dataset of 1,700 expert-annotated user-reference video pairs spanning 22 strength and mobility exercises. To accelerate research in AI-driven coaching, we release both the dataset and an automated, rubric-based evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized comparison across models. Our benchmarks reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level coaching, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in integrating nuanced, context-aware movement analysis into interactive AI systems. By framing form correction as a collaborative and creative process between humans and machines, FormCoach opens a new frontier in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Affordance-Aware Robotic Dexterous Grasping with Human-like Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08896v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A dexterous hand capable of generalizable grasping objects is fundamental for the development of general-purpose embodied AI. However, previous methods focus narrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordance-aware positioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, a novel framework with two-stage training that learns a universal grasping policy with an inherent understanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage, a trajectory imitator is pre-trained on a large corpus of human hand motions to instill a strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, a residual module is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object instances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative Affordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally inappropriate contact regions, and a privileged teacher-student distillation process that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal dexterous grasping but also remains remarkably human-like in posture and functionally appropriate in contact location. As a result, AffordDex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seen objects, unseen instances, and even entirely novel categories.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

Despite decades of explorations, it remains challenging for embodied agents to achieve human-level intelligence for general-purpose tasks in open dynamic environments. Recent breakthroughs in large models have revolutionized embodied AI by enhancing perception, interaction, planning and learning. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on large model empowered embodied AI, focusing on autonomous decision-making and embodied learning. We investigate both hierarchical and end-to-end decision-making paradigms, detailing how large models enhance high-level planning, low-level execution, and feedback for hierarchical decision-making, and how large models enhance Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end decision making. For embodied learning, we introduce mainstream learning methodologies, elaborating on how large models enhance imitation learning and reinforcement learning in-depth. For the first time, we integrate world models into the survey of embodied AI, presenting their design methods and critical roles in enhancing decision-making and learning. Though solid advances have been achieved, challenges still exist, which are discussed at the end of this survey, potentially as the further research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoSE: Skill-by-Skill Mixture-of-Experts Learning for Embodied Autonomous Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07818v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To meet the growing demand for smarter, faster, and more efficient embodied AI solutions, we introduce a novel Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) method that significantly boosts reasoning and learning efficiency for embodied autonomous systems. General MoE models demand extensive training data and complex optimization, which limits their applicability in embodied AI such as autonomous driving (AD) and robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose a skill-oriented MoE called MoSE, which mimics the human learning and reasoning process skill-by-skill, step-by-step. We introduce a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the necessary competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks, thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. To better align with multi-step planning in human reasoning and in end-to-end driving models, we build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the model to think step-by-step. Unlike other multi-round dialogues, MoSE integrates valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g. perception-prediction-planning for AD, and high-level and low-level planning for robots) in one single forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model effectively grows more diverse expertise and outperforms models on both AD corner-case reasoning tasks and robot reasoning tasks with less than 40% of the parameters.</p></details> |  |

We also provide a rich variety of playable entities, including humans, animals, robots, and vehicles for embodied AI research. We extend UnrealCV with optimized APIs and tools for data collection, environment augmentation, distributed training, and benchmarking. These improvements achieve significant improvements in the efficiency of rendering and communication, enabling advanced applications such as multi-agent interactions. Our experimental evaluation across visual navigation and tracking tasks reveals two key insights: 1) environmental diversity provides substantial benefits for developing generalizable reinforcement learning (RL) agents, and 2) current embodied agents face persistent challenges in open-world scenarios, including navigation in unstructured terrain, adaptation to unseen morphologies, and managing latency in the close-loop control systems for interacting in highly dynamic objects. UnrealZoo thus serves as both a comprehensive testing ground and a pathway toward developing more capable embodied AI systems for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlight), Project page: http://unrealzoo.site/</p></details> |

Generating synthetic images that closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins, facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using images generated by DiffPhysCam.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 17 figures, and 4 tables</p></details> |

A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |

This task requires the model to identify newly described objects that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view, posing a significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF. Our analysis reveals that 3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key challenges for R3DGS. To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language expressions in a spatially aware paradigm. ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the newly proposed R3DGS task and 3D open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks.

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

As robotics and automated systems scale, efficient data-sharing frameworks and robust algorithms become critical. We explore the pivotal role of data handling in next-gen networks, focusing on dynamics between application and network providers (AP/NP) in DT ecosystems. We introduce PANAMA, a novel algorithm with Priority Asymmetry for Network Aware Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based multi-agent path finding (MAPF). By adopting a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework and asynchronous actor-learner architectures, PANAMA accelerates training while enabling autonomous task execution by embodied AI. Our approach demonstrates superior pathfinding performance in accuracy, speed, and scalability compared to existing benchmarks. Through simulations, we highlight optimized data-sharing strategies for scalable, automated systems, ensuring resilience in complex, real-world environments. PANAMA bridges the gap between network-aware decision-making and robust multi-agent coordination, advancing the synergy between DTs, wireless networks, and AI-driven automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety of Embodied Navigation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05855v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain influence, the development of embodied AI has accelerated, drawing significant attention, particularly in navigation scenarios. Embodied navigation requires an agent to perceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a specified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied navigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development of safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the findings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety and increasing industrial efficiency.</p></details> |  |

We present OmniEAR, a comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to 56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically (0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zju-real.github.io/OmniEmbodied Code: https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/OmniEmbodied</p></details> |

In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentSense: Virtual Sensor Data Generation Using LLM Agents in Simulated Home Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11773v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge in developing robust and generalizable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems for smart homes is the lack of large and diverse labeled datasets. Variations in home layouts, sensor configurations, and individual behaviors further exacerbate this issue. To address this, we leverage the idea of embodied AI agents-virtual agents that perceive and act within simulated environments guided by internal world models. We introduce AgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline in which agents live out daily routines in simulated smart homes, with behavior guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM generates diverse synthetic personas and realistic routines grounded in the environment, which are then decomposed into fine-grained actions. These actions are executed in an extended version of the VirtualHome simulator, which we augment with virtual ambient sensors that record the agents' activities. Our approach produces rich, privacy-preserving sensor data that reflects real-world diversity. We evaluate AgentSense on five real HAR datasets. Models pretrained on the generated data consistently outperform baselines, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore, combining the generated virtual sensor data with a small amount of real data achieves performance comparable to training on full real-world datasets. These results highlight the potential of using LLM-guided embodied agents for scalable and cost-effective sensor data generation in HAR.</p></details> |  |
| **[IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16402v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems. Code and data are released under [this https URL](https://github.com/AI45Lab/IS-Bench).</p></details> |  |

These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI, which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally, existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes (e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints. We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D spatial intelligence.

However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v4)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Robotic Manipulation Generalization with Minimal Costly Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19516v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied AI intensifies the demand for diverse manipulation demonstrations. However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the RoboTron-Craft, a stage-divided and cost-effective pipeline for realistic manipulation generation. Base on this, the RoboTron-Platter method is introduced, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.

| **[Object Affordance Recognition and Grounding via Multi-scale Cross-modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01184v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification). Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance grounding and classification.</p></details> |  |

| **[OpenFly: A Comprehensive Platform for Aerial Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18041v6)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to guide agents by leveraging language instructions and visual cues, playing a pivotal role in embodied AI. Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising various rendering engines, a versatile toolchain, and a large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we integrate diverse rendering engines and advanced techniques for environment simulation, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of our environments. Secondly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for aerial VLN data collection, streamlining point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Thirdly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. Moreover, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model emphasizing key observations during flight. For benchmarking, extensive experiments and analyses are conducted, evaluating several recent VLN methods and showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Early Goal-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion for Real-Time Vision-Language Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23042v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Exploring the Link Between Bayesian Inference and Embodied Intelligence: Toward Open Physical-World Embodied AI Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21589v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open physical-world embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Multifunctional physical reservoir computing in soft tensegrity robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21496v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of physical systems can be utilized for the desired information processing under the framework of physical reservoir computing (PRC). Robots with soft bodies are examples of such physical systems, and their nonlinear body-environment dynamics can be used to compute and generate the motor signals necessary for the control of their own behavior. In this simulation study, we extend this approach to control and embed not only one but also multiple behaviors into a type of soft robot called a tensegrity robot. The resulting system, consisting of the robot and the environment, is a multistable dynamical system that converges to different attractors from varying initial conditions. Furthermore, attractor analysis reveals that there exist "untrained attractors" in the state space of the system outside the training data. These untrained attractors reflect the intrinsic properties and structures of the tensegrity robot and its interactions with the environment. The impacts of these recent findings in PRC remain unexplored in embodied AI research. We here illustrate their potential to understand various features of embodied cognition that have not been fully addressed to date.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 12 figures.

| **[MazeEval: A Benchmark for Testing Sequential Decision-Making in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20395v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment. Despite advances in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$, other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100% of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English, suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable navigation across linguistic contexts.</p></details> |  |

While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive, expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types, combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation) generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive humanoid motion generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://rosielab.github.io/compas3d</p></details> |

As a burgeoning research frontier, 4D generation enables richer interactive and immersive experiences, with applications ranging from digital humans to autonomous driving. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks a unified understanding of 4D representations, generative frameworks, basic paradigms, and the core technical challenges it faces. This survey provides a systematic and in-depth review of the 4D generation landscape. To comprehensively characterize 4D generation, we first categorize fundamental 4D representations and outline associated techniques for 4D generation. We then present an in-depth analysis of representative generative pipelines based on conditions and representation methods. Subsequently, we discuss how motion and geometry priors are integrated into 4D outputs to ensure spatio-temporal consistency under various control schemes. From an application perspective, this paper summarizes 4D generation tasks in areas such as dynamic object/scene generation, digital human synthesis, editable 4D content, and embodied AI. Furthermore, we summarize and multi-dimensionally compare four basic paradigms for 4D generation: End-to-End, Generated-Data-Based, Implicit-Distillation-Based, and Explicit-Supervision-Based. Concluding our analysis, we highlight five key challenges-consistency, controllability, diversity, efficiency, and fidelity-and contextualize these with current approaches.By distilling recent advances and outlining open problems, this work offers a comprehensive and forward-looking perspective to guide future research in 4D generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards provable probabilistic safety for scalable embodied AI systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05171v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable embodied AI systems. Instead, empirical safety evaluation is employed as an alternative, but the absence of provable guarantees imposes significant limitations. To address these issues, we argue for a paradigm shift to provable probabilistic safety that integrates provable guarantees with progressive achievement toward a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance. The new paradigm better leverages statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability, and a well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be deployed at scale. In this Perspective, we outline a roadmap for provable probabilistic safety, along with corresponding challenges and potential solutions. By bridging the gap between theoretical safety assurance and practical deployment, this Perspective offers a pathway toward safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical applications.</p></details> |  |

As they serve as the primary visual input for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient is therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, but their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video inputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person videos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints inherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a training-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning. EgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR for temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering (PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and removes redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token selector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame diversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune consistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning ratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover, we deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB edge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for on-device egomotion video reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Existing 3D generation primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models, the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we propose \textbf{PhysX-3D}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material, affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models, which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2) Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research in generative physical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://physx-3d.github.io/</p></details> |

Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

As a result, we are seeing similar advancements in embodied AI and robotics for control policy generation. Our review paper examines the integration of generative AI models with RL to advance robotics. Our primary focus is on the duality between generative AI and RL for robotics downstream tasks. Specifically, we investigate: (1) The role of prominent generative AI tools as modular priors for multi-modal input fusion in RL tasks. (2) How RL can train, fine-tune and distill generative models for policy generation, such as VLA models, similarly to RL applications in large language models. We then propose a new taxonomy based on a considerable amount of selected papers. Lastly, we identify open challenges accounting for model scalability, adaptation and grounding, giving recommendations and insights on future research directions. We reflect on which generative AI models best fit the RL tasks and why. On the other side, we reflect on important issues inherent to RL-enhanced generative policies, such as safety concerns and failure modes, and what are the limitations of current methods.

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.

| **[View Invariant Learning for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08831v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training method.</p></details> | Under review |

However, expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects, and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training. Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively activates more neuron values in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Reasoning for Embodied Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22050v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied planning requires agents to make coherent multi-step decisions based on dynamic visual observations and natural language goals. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) excel at static perception tasks, they struggle with the temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and commonsense grounding needed for planning in interactive environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that brings R1-style reasoning enhancement into embodied planning. We first distill a high-quality dataset from a powerful closed-source model and perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with structured decision-making priors. We then design a rule-based reward function tailored to multi-step action quality and optimize the policy via Generalized Reinforced Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our approach is evaluated on Embench, a recent benchmark for interactive embodied tasks, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms models of similar or larger scale, including GPT-4o-mini and 70B+ open-source baselines, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen environments. This work highlights the potential of reinforcement-driven reasoning to advance long-horizon planning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Long-term Point Tracking in the Foundation Model Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09217v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However, real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets, offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines. However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time. Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks, demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2501.18487</p></details> |

To tackle these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models.

| **[SURPRISE3D: A Dataset for Spatial Understanding and Reasoning in Complex 3D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07781v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world. Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research. Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite. S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic planning.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing target person tracking (TPT) benchmarks are limited to controlled laboratory environments with few distractions, clean backgrounds, and short-term occlusions. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoramic images, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 48 sequences, both indoors and outdoors. Using this dataset and visual annotations, we perform extensive experiments with existing SOTA TPT methods, offering a thorough analysis of their limitations and suggesting future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. web: https://medlartea.github.io/tpt-bench/</p></details> |
| **[A Neural Representation Framework with LLM-Driven Spatial Reasoning for Open-Vocabulary 3D Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06719v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical feature field. This field represents language and instance features using distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations, outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their spatial reasoning capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamArt: Generating Interactable Articulated Objects from a Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05763v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating articulated objects, such as laptops and microwaves, is a crucial yet challenging task with extensive applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR. Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture, neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated asset generation.

Reinforcement learning offers a way to model sequential decision-making through dynamic programming to anticipate future environmental changes. However, applying multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to decentralized combinatorial optimization problems remains an open challenge due to the exponential growth of the joint state-action space, high communication overhead, and privacy concerns in centralized training. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Hierarchical Reinforcement and Collective Learning (HRCL), a novel approach that leverages both MARL and decentralized collective learning based on a hierarchical framework. Agents take high-level strategies using MARL to group possible plans for action space reduction and constrain the agent behavior for Pareto optimality. Meanwhile, the low-level collective learning layer ensures efficient and decentralized coordinated decisions among agents with minimal communication. Extensive experiments in a synthetic scenario and real-world smart city application models, including energy self-management and drone swarm sensing, demonstrate that HRCL significantly improves performance, scalability, and adaptability compared to the standalone MARL and collective learning approaches, achieving a win-win synthesis solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on games or isolated puzzles, Reasoning Core procedurally generates problems across core formal domains, including PDDL planning, first-order logic, context-free grammar parsing, causal reasoning, and system equation solving. The environment is built on key design principles of high-generality problem distributions, verification via external tools, and continuous difficulty control, which together provide a virtually infinite supply of novel training instances. Initial zero-shot evaluations with frontier LLMs confirm the difficulty of Reasoning Core's tasks, positioning it as a promising resource to improve the reasoning capabilities of future models.</p></details> |  |

We reveal that existing reinforcement learning methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), rely on on-policy sampling for policy updates. However, in tasks with large temporal search spaces, this strategy becomes both inefficient and limited in performance, as it often fails to identify temporally accurate solutions. To address this limitation, TempSamp-R1 leverages ground-truth annotations as off-policy supervision to provide temporally precise guidance, effectively compensating for the sparsity and misalignment in on-policy solutions. To further stabilize training and reduce variance in reward-based updates, TempSamp-R1 provides a non-linear soft advantage computation method that dynamically reshapes the reward feedback via an asymmetric transformation. By employing a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training paradigm, TempSamp-R1 optimizes a single unified model to support both CoT and non-CoT inference modes, enabling efficient handling of queries with varying reasoning complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TempSamp-R1 outperforms GRPO-based baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets: Charades-STA (R1@0.7: 52.9%, +2.7%), ActivityNet Captions (R1@0.5: 56.0%, +5.3%), and QVHighlights (mAP: 30.0%, +3.0%). Moreover, TempSamp-R1 shows robust few-shot generalization capabilities under limited data.

We present HuMam, a state-centric end-to-end RL framework that employs a single-layer Mamba encoder to fuse robot-centric states with oriented footstep targets and a continuous phase clock. The policy outputs joint position targets tracked by a low-level PD loop and is optimized with PPO. A concise six-term reward balances contact quality, swing smoothness, foot placement, posture, and body stability while implicitly promoting energy saving. On the JVRC-1 humanoid in mc-mujoco, HuMam consistently improves learning efficiency, training stability, and overall task performance over a strong feedforward baseline, while reducing power consumption and torque peaks. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end humanoid RL controller that adopts Mamba as the fusion backbone, demonstrating tangible gains in efficiency, stability, and control economy.</p></details> | 10 pages |

While many benchmarks incorporate sufficiently complex real-world problems, they lack controllability over the degree of challenges posed to memory models. In contrast, synthetic environments enable fine-grained manipulation of dynamics, making them critical for detailed and rigorous evaluation of memory-augmented RL. Our study focuses on POMDP synthesis with three key contributions: 1. A theoretical framework for analyzing POMDPs, grounded in Memory Demand Structure (MDS), transition invariance, and related concepts; 2. A methodology leveraging linear process dynamics, state aggregation, and reward redistribution to construct customized POMDPs with predefined properties; 3. Empirically validated series of POMDP environments with increasing difficulty levels, designed based on our theoretical insights. Our work clarifies the challenges of memory-augmented RL in solving POMDPs, provides guidelines for analyzing and designing POMDP environments, and offers empirical support for selecting memory models in RL tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ComposableNav: Instruction-Following Navigation in Dynamic Environments via Composable Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17941v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers the problem of enabling robots to navigate dynamic environments while following instructions. The challenge lies in the combinatorial nature of instruction specifications: each instruction can include multiple specifications, and the number of possible specification combinations grows exponentially as the robot's skill set expands. For example, "overtake the pedestrian while staying on the right side of the road" consists of two specifications: "overtake the pedestrian" and "walk on the right side of the road." To tackle this challenge, we propose ComposableNav, based on the intuition that following an instruction involves independently satisfying its constituent specifications, each corresponding to a distinct motion primitive. Using diffusion models, ComposableNav learns each primitive separately, then composes them in parallel at deployment time to satisfy novel combinations of specifications unseen in training. Additionally, to avoid the onerous need for demonstrations of individual motion primitives, we propose a two-stage training procedure: (1) supervised pre-training to learn a base diffusion model for dynamic navigation, and (2) reinforcement learning fine-tuning that molds the base model into different motion primitives. Through simulation and real-world experiments, we show that ComposableNav enables robots to follow instructions by generating trajectories that satisfy diverse and unseen combinations of specifications, significantly outperforming both non-compositional VLM-based policies and costmap composing baselines.

Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels, enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech.

In this paper, we introduce Orcust, a framework that integrates Principle-Constrained Reward Modeling (PCRM) and Online VM-Grounded Trajectory Construction (OVTC) to enhance reasoning reliability and data efficiency in interactive GUI tasks. We leverages environment-verifiable and LLM-derived principle to enforce interpretable reward signals that constrain long chain-of-thought reasoning and rule-based feedback. OVTC spins up instrumented virtual machines to autonomously collect structured GUI interaction trajectories with explicit procedural and structural objectives, enabling the training of a stepwise reward model that robustly captures human preferences and adheres to task-specific constraints. Extensive experiments on standard GUI benchmarks covering perceptual grounding, foundational operations, and end-to-end task execution reveal that Orcust achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving by 22.2\% on ScreenSpot and 23.9\% on ScreenSpot-Pro over the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The results demonstrate Orcust's effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning, adaptability and scalability of GUI agents across various environments and task complexities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sight Over Site: Perception-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Robotic Inspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17877v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous inspection is a central problem in robotics, with applications ranging from industrial monitoring to search-and-rescue. Traditionally, inspection has often been reduced to navigation tasks, where the objective is to reach a predefined location while avoiding obstacles. However, this formulation captures only part of the real inspection problem. In real-world environments, the inspection targets may become visible well before their exact coordinates are reached, making further movement both redundant and inefficient. What matters more for inspection is not simply arriving at the target's position, but positioning the robot at a viewpoint from which the target becomes observable. In this work, we revisit inspection from a perception-aware perspective. We propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that explicitly incorporates target visibility as the primary objective, enabling the robot to find the shortest trajectory that guarantees visual contact with the target without relying on a map. The learned policy leverages both perceptual and proprioceptive sensing and is trained entirely in simulation, before being deployed to a real-world robot. We further develop an algorithm to compute ground-truth shortest inspection paths, which provides a reference for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method outperforms existing classical and learning-based navigation approaches, yielding more efficient inspection trajectories in both simulated and real-world settings. The project is avialable at https://sight-over-site.github.io/</p></details> |  |

Each customer suggests several time slots for their maintenance task, from which the OEM must select one. This decision needs to be made promptly to support customers' planning. At the end of each day, routes for service engineers are planned to fulfill the tasks scheduled for the following day. We study this hierarchical and sequential decision-making problem-the Dynamic Time Slot Assignment Problem with Commitments and Customer Preferences (DTSAP-CCP)-in this paper. Methodology/results: Two distinct approaches are proposed: 1) an attention-based deep reinforcement learning with rollout execution (ADRL-RE) and 2) a scenario-based planning approach (SBP). The ADRL-RE combines a well-trained attention-based neural network with a rollout framework for online trajectory simulation. To support the training, we develop a neural heuristic solver that provides rapid route planning solutions, enabling efficient learning in complex combinatorial settings. The SBP approach samples several scenarios to guide the time slot assignment. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of ADRL-RE and the stability of SBP compared to both rule-based and rollout-based approaches. Furthermore, the strong practicality of ADRL-RE is verified in a case study of after-sales service for large medical equipment. Implications: This study provides OEMs with practical decision-support tools for dynamic maintenance scheduling, balancing customer preferences and operational efficiency. In particular, our ADRL-RE shows strong real-world potential, supporting timely and customer-aligned maintenance scheduling.</p></details> |  |

However, when the rollout accuracy is low on hard problems, the reward becomes sparse, limiting learning efficiency and causing exploration bottlenecks. Existing approaches either rely on teacher models for distillation or filter out difficult problems, which limits scalability or restricts reasoning improvement through exploration. We propose EvoCoT, a self-evolving curriculum learning framework based on two-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning optimization. EvoCoT constrains the exploration space by self-generating and verifying CoT trajectories, then gradually shortens CoT steps to expand the space in a controlled way. The framework enables LLMs to stably learn from initially unsolved hard problems under sparse rewards. We apply EvoCoT to multiple LLM families, including Qwen, DeepSeek, and Llama. Experiments show that EvoCoT enables LLMs to solve previously unsolved problems, improves reasoning capability without external CoT supervision, and is compatible with various RL fine-tuning methods. We release the source code to support future research.</p></details> |  |

This learning paradigm is, however, well-known for being time-consuming due to the necessity of collecting a large amount of data, making RL suffer from sample inefficiency and difficult generalization. Furthermore, the construction of an explicit reward function that accounts for the trade-off between multiple desiderata of a decision problem is often a laborious task. These challenges have been recently addressed utilizing transfer and inverse reinforcement learning (T-IRL). In this regard, this paper is devoted to a comprehensive review of realizing the sample efficiency and generalization of RL algorithms through T-IRL. Following a brief introduction to RL, the fundamental T-IRL methods are presented and the most recent advancements in each research field have been extensively reviewed. Our findings denote that a majority of recent research works have dealt with the aforementioned challenges by utilizing human-in-the-loop and sim-to-real strategies for the efficient transfer of knowledge from source domains to the target domain under the transfer learning scheme. Under the IRL structure, training schemes that require a low number of experience transitions and extension of such frameworks to multi-agent and multi-intention problems have been the priority of researchers in recent years.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving reliable predictions in highly dynamic and complex traffic scenarios remains a significant challenge. One of the key impediments lies in the limited effectiveness of current approaches to capture the multi-modal behaviors of drivers, which leads to predicted trajectories that deviate from actual future motions. To address this issue, we propose SocialTraj, a novel trajectory prediction framework integrating social psychology principles through social value orientation (SVO). By utilizing Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to estimate the SVO of SVs, we obtain the critical social context to infer the future interaction trend. To ensure modal consistency in predicted behaviors, the estimated SVOs of SVs are embedded into a conditional denoising diffusion model that aligns generated trajectories with historical driving styles. Additionally, the planned future trajectory of the ego vehicle (EV) is explicitly incorporated to enhance interaction modeling. Extensive experiments on NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that SocialTraj is capable of adapting to highly dynamic and interactive scenarios while generating socially compliant and behaviorally consistent trajectory predictions, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that dynamic SVO estimation and explicit ego-planning components notably improve prediction accuracy and substantially reduce inference time.</p></details> |  |

Yet it remains a challenging problem, as effective systems must robustly handle unseen worksite conditions and new hardware configurations. Current state-of-the-art approaches rely on highly engineered, task-specific controllers, which require extensive manual tuning for each new scenario. In contrast, recent advances in large-scale pretrained models have shown remarkable adaptability across tasks and embodiments in domains such as manipulation and navigation, but their applicability to heavy construction machinery remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce ExT, a unified open-source framework for large-scale demonstration collection, pretraining, and fine-tuning of multitask excavation policies. ExT policies are first trained on large-scale demonstrations collected from a mix of experts, then fine-tuned either with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) to specialize to new tasks or operating conditions. Through both simulation and real-world experiments, we show that pretrained ExT policies can execute complete excavation cycles with centimeter-level accuracy, successfully transferring from simulation to real machine with performance comparable to specialized single-task controllers. Furthermore, in simulation, we demonstrate that ExT's fine-tuning pipelines allow rapid adaptation to new tasks, out-of-distribution conditions, and machine configurations, while maintaining strong performance on previously learned tasks. These results highlight the potential of ExT to serve as a foundation for scalable and generalizable autonomous excavation.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we propose tactile sensing-based reward shaping and incorporate the sensing into the observation space through embedding. The designed rewards encourage an agent to ensure firm grasping and smooth finger gaiting at the same time, leading to higher data efficiency and robust performance compared to the baseline. We verify the proposed framework on the opening a lid scenario, showing generalization of the trained policy into a couple of object types and various dynamics such as torsional friction.

However, practical approaches to interaction driven robotic learning are still underexplored, particularly for long-horizon tasks where sequential decision-making, physical constraints, and perceptual uncertainties pose significant chal lenges. Motivated by embodied cognition theory, we propose RoboSeek, a framework for embodied action execution that leverages interactive experience to accomplish manipulation tasks. RoboSeek optimizes prior knowledge from high-level perception models through closed-loop training in simulation and achieves robust real-world execution via a real2sim2real transfer pipeline. Specifically, we first replicate real-world environments in simulation using 3D reconstruction to provide visually and physically consistent environments., then we train policies in simulation using reinforcement learning and the cross-entropy method leveraging visual priors. The learned policies are subsequently deployed on real robotic platforms for execution. RoboSeek is hardware-agnostic and is evaluated on multiple robotic platforms across eight long-horizon ma nipulation tasks involving sequential interactions, tool use, and object handling. Our approach achieves an average success rate of 79%, significantly outperforming baselines whose success rates remain below 50%, highlighting its generalization and robustness across tasks and platforms. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our training framework in complex, dynamic real-world settings and demonstrate the stability of the proposed real2sim2real transfer mechanism, paving the way for more generalizable embodied robotic learning.

| **[Robust Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Distortion Risk Measures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10096v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a reinforcement learning (RL) setting, the agent's optimal strategy heavily depends on her risk preferences and the underlying model dynamics of the training environment. These two aspects influence the agent's ability to make well-informed and time-consistent decisions when facing testing environments. In this work, we devise a framework to solve robust risk-aware RL problems where we simultaneously account for environmental uncertainty and risk with a class of dynamic robust distortion risk measures. Robustness is introduced by considering all models within a Wasserstein ball around a reference model. We estimate such dynamic robust risk measures using neural networks by making use of strictly consistent scoring functions, derive policy gradient formulae using the quantile representation of distortion risk measures, and construct an actor-critic algorithm to solve this class of robust risk-aware RL problems. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a portfolio allocation example.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |
| **[A Large Language Model-based multi-agent manufacturing system for intelligent shopfloor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16887v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As customer demand for multi-variety and small-batch production increases, dynamic disturbances place greater demands on manufacturing systems. To address such challenges, researchers proposed the multi-agent manufacturing system. However, conventional agent negotiation typically relies on pre-defined and fixed heuristic rules, which are ill-suited to managing complex and fluctuating disturbances. In current implementations, mainstream approaches based on reinforcement learning require the development of simulators and training models specific to a given shopfloor, necessitating substantial computational resources and lacking scalability. To overcome this limitation, the present study proposes a Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) multi-agent manufacturing system for intelligent shopfloor management. By defining the diverse modules of agents and their collaborative methods, this system facilitates the processing of all workpieces with minimal human intervention. The agents in this system consist of the Machine Server Module (MSM), Bid Inviter Module (BIM), Bidder Module (BM), Thinking Module (TM), and Decision Module (DM). By harnessing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, these modules enable agents to dynamically analyze shopfloor information and select appropriate processing machines. The LLM-based modules, predefined by system prompts, provide dynamic functionality for the system without the need for pre-training. Extensive experiments were conducted in physical shopfloor settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed system exhibits strong adaptability, and achieves superior performance (makespan) and stability (as measured by sample standard deviation) compared to other approaches without requiring pre-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[ConfClip: Confidence-Weighted and Clipped Reward for Reinforcement Learning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17730v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a standard paradigm for refining large language models (LLMs) beyond pre-training and instruction tuning. A prominent line of work is RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which leverages automatically verifiable outcomes (e.g., correctness or executability) to generate reward signals. While efficient, this framework faces two key limitations: First, its binary feedback is too sparse to capture the quality of the reasoning process. Second, its coarse-grained rewards potentially lead to vanishing gradients. Inspired by observations from human learning, we introduce a RL technique that integrates verifiable outcomes with the model's own confidence estimates. This joint design enriches the reward signal, providing finer-grained feedback and implicitly supervising the reasoning process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method enhances RL performance across multiple datasets and reduces token consumption during inference, while incurring negligible additional training cost. Moreover, it can be used as a plug-in module to enhance other state-of-the-art RL methods.</p></details> |  |

Mitigating OCR Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20168v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have enhanced document understanding by integrating textual and visual information. However, existing models exhibit incompleteness within their paradigm in real-world scenarios, particularly under visual degradation. In such conditions, the current response paradigm often fails to adequately perceive visual degradation and ambiguity, leading to overreliance on linguistic priors or misaligned visual-textual reasoning. This difficulty in recognizing uncertainty frequently results in the generation of hallucinatory content, especially when a precise answer is not feasible. To better demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon and problem, we propose KIE-HVQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating OCR hallucination in degraded document understanding. This dataset includes test samples spanning identity cards and invoices, with simulated real-world degradations for OCR reliability. This setup allows for evaluating models' capacity, under degraded input, to distinguish reliable visual information and answer accordingly, thereby highlighting the challenge of avoiding hallucination on uncertain data. To achieve vision-faithful reasoning and thereby avoid the aforementioned issues, we further introduce a GRPO-based framework featuring a novel reward mechanism. By incorporating a self-awareness of visual uncertainty and an analysis method that initiates refusal to answer to increase task difficulty within our supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning framework, we successfully mitigated hallucinations in ambiguous regions. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that our 7B-parameter model achieves a 22\% absolute improvement in hallucination-free accuracy over GPT-4o on KIE-HVQA and there is no significant performance drop in standard tasks, highlighting both effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, crucial for enhancing large model post-training, cannot adapt to decentralized distributed training due to the tight coupling between parameter learning and rollout sampling. For this, we propose HeteroRL, a heterogeneous RL architecture that decouples these processes, enabling stable training across geographically distributed nodes connected via the Internet. The core component is Group Expectation Policy Optimization (GEPO), an asynchronous RL algorithm robust to latency caused by network delays or heterogeneity in computational resources. Our study reveals that high latency significantly increases KL divergence, leading to higher variance in importance sampling weights and training instability. GEPO mitigates this issue by using group expectation weighting to exponentially reduce the variance of importance weights, with theoretical guarantees. Experiments show that GEPO achieves superior stability, with only a 3\% performance drop from online to 1800s latency, demonstrating strong potential for decentralized RL in geographically distributed, resource-heterogeneous computing environments.</p></details> |  |

Purely template-based or end-to-end reinforcement learning-based methods suffer from such harsh terrains. This paper proposes a two stage training framework for such narrow path traversing tasks, coupling a template-based foothold planner with a low-level foothold tracker from Stage-I training and a lightweight perception aided foothold modifier from Stage-II training. With the curriculum setup from flat ground to narrow paths across stages, the resulted controller in turn learns to robustly track and safely modify foothold targets to ensure precise foot placement over narrow paths. This framework preserves the interpretability from the physics-based template and takes advantage of the generalization capability from reinforcement learning, resulting in easy sim-to-real transfer. The learned policies outperform purely template-based or reinforcement learning-based baselines in terms of success rate, centerline adherence and safety margins. Validation on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot yields successful traversal of a 0.2m wide and 3m long beam for 20 trials without any failure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://huangtc233.github.io/Traversing-the-Narrow-Path/</p></details> |
| **[RSU-Assisted Resource Allocation for Collaborative Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17691v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a pivotal technology for autonomous driving, collaborative perception enables vehicular agents to exchange perceptual data through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, thereby enhancing perception accuracy of all collaborators. However, existing collaborative perception frameworks often assume ample communication resources, which is usually impractical in real-world vehicular networks. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the problem of communication resource allocation for collaborative perception and proposes RACooper, a novel RSU-assisted resource allocation framework that maximizes perception accuracy under constrained communication resources. RACooper leverages a hierarchical reinforcement learning model to dynamically allocate communication resources while accounting for real-time sensing data and channel dynamics induced by vehicular mobility. By jointly optimizing spatial confidence metrics and channel state information, our approach ensures efficient feature transmission, enhancing the effectiveness of collaborative perception. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to conventional baseline algorithms, RACooper achieves significant improvements in perception accuracy, especially under bandwidth-constrained scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Learning Boulder Excavation with Hydraulic Excavators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17683v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Construction sites frequently require removing large rocks before excavation or grading can proceed. Human operators typically extract these boulders using only standard digging buckets, avoiding time-consuming tool changes to specialized grippers. This task demands manipulating irregular objects with unknown geometries in harsh outdoor environments where dust, variable lighting, and occlusions hinder perception. The excavator must adapt to varying soil resistance--dragging along hard-packed surfaces or penetrating soft ground--while coordinating multiple hydraulic joints to secure rocks using a shovel. Current autonomous excavation focuses on continuous media (soil, gravel) or uses specialized grippers with detailed geometric planning for discrete objects. These approaches either cannot handle large irregular rocks or require impractical tool changes that interrupt workflow. We train a reinforcement learning policy in simulation using rigid-body dynamics and analytical soil models. The policy processes sparse LiDAR points (just 20 per rock) from vision-based segmentation and proprioceptive feedback to control standard excavator buckets. The learned agent discovers different strategies based on soil resistance: dragging along the surface in hard soil and penetrating directly in soft conditions. Field tests on a 12-ton excavator achieved 70% success across varied rocks (0.4-0.7m) and soil types, compared to 83% for human operators. This demonstrates that standard construction equipment can learn complex manipulation despite sparse perception and challenging outdoor conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving high energy efficiency in such networks remains a critical challenge, particularly in large-scale or dynamically changing environments. Traditional terrestrial LoRa deployments often suffer from coverage gaps and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) propagation losses, while satellite-based IoT solutions consume excessive energy and introduce high latency, limiting their suitability for energy-constrained and delay-sensitive applications. To address these limitations, we propose a novel architecture using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying LoRa gateways to dynamically collect data from ground-based LoRa end devices. Our approach aims to maximize the system's weighted global energy efficiency by jointly optimizing spreading factors, transmission powers, UAV trajectories, and end-device associations. Additionally, we formulate this complex optimization problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and propose green LoRa multi-agent proximal policy optimization (GLo-MAPPO), a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). Simulation results show that GLo-MAPPO significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms, achieving energy efficiency improvements of 71.25%, 18.56%, 67.00%, 59.73%, and 49.95% for networks with 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 LoRa end devices, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 19 figures, journal</p></details> |

Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback, trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods, achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achieved a PSNR of 41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to 94%, achieving 4% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based denoising.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Such \emph{dynamic} dependencies (and corresponding dynamic tensor shapes) are difficult to express and optimize: while \emph{eager} DL systems support such dynamism, they cannot apply compiler-based optimizations; \emph{graph-based} systems require static tensor shapes, which forces users to pad tensors or break-up programs into multiple static graphs. We describe Tempo, a new DL system that combines the dynamism of eager execution with the whole-program optimizations of graph-based compilation. Tempo achieves this through a declarative programming model with \emph{recurrent tensors}, which include explicit \emph{temporal dimensions}. Temporal dimensions can be indexed using \emph{symbolic expressions} to express dynamic dependencies on past and future tensors. Based on this, Tempo constructs a \emph{symbolic dependence graph}, which concisely encodes dynamic dependencies between operators, and applies whole-program optimizations, such as algebraic simplifications, vectorization, tiling, and fusion. By tiling dynamic dependencies into static-size blocks, Tempo can also reuse existing static code-generators. It then uses a polyhedral model to find a feasible execution schedule, which includes memory management operations. We show that Tempo achieves a 7$\times$ speedup over JAX for Llama-3.2-3B decoding; for reinforcement learning algorithms, Tempo achieves a 54$\times$ speedup, with 16$\times$ lower peak memory usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 24 figures, 3 bibliography pages</p></details> |

A central challenge of this task lies in accurately handling complex tables -- those with large sizes, deeply nested structures, and semantically rich or irregular cell content -- where existing methods often fail. We begin with a comprehensive analysis, identifying key challenges and highlighting the limitations of current evaluation protocols. To overcome these issues, we propose a reinforced multimodal large language model (MLLM) framework, where a pre-trained MLLM is fine-tuned on a large-scale table-to-LaTeX dataset. To further improve generation quality, we introduce a dual-reward reinforcement learning strategy based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike standard approaches that optimize purely over text outputs, our method incorporates both a structure-level reward on LaTeX code and a visual fidelity reward computed from rendered outputs, enabling direct optimization of the visual output quality. We adopt a hybrid evaluation protocol combining TEDS-Structure and CW-SSIM, and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on structurally complex tables, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Such methods often fail to scale, as every new problem or application requires time-consuming and iterative reward definition and tuning. We present Generalist Contact-Conditioned Policy (GeCCo) -- a low-level policy trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning that is capable of tracking arbitrary contact points on a quadruped robot. The strength of our approach is that it provides a general and modular low-level controller that can be reused for a wider range of high-level tasks, without the need to re-train new controllers from scratch. We demonstrate the scalability and robustness of our method by evaluating on a wide range of locomotion and manipulation tasks in a common framework and under a single generalist policy. These include a variety of gaits, traversing complex terrains (eg. stairs and slopes) as well as previously unseen stepping-stones and narrow beams, and interacting with objects (eg. pushing buttons, tracking trajectories). Our framework acquires new behaviors more efficiently, simply by combining a task-specific high-level contact planner and the pre-trained generalist policy.

We introduce MolExp, a novel benchmark emphasizing the discovery of structurally diverse molecules with similar bioactivity, simulating real-world drug design challenges. Our results demonstrate that scaling TTT by increasing the number of independent RL agents follows a log-linear scaling law, significantly improving exploration efficiency as measured by MolExp. In contrast, increasing TTT training time yields diminishing returns, even with exploration bonuses. We further evaluate cooperative RL strategies to enhance exploration efficiency.

The ability to employ affordance-aware poses to grasp objects with diverse geometries and properties in arbitrary scenarios is essential for general-purpose robots. However, existing research predominantly addresses dexterous grasping problems within simulators, which encounter difficulties when applied in real-world environments due to the domain gap between reality and simulation. This limitation hinders their generalizability and practicality in real-world applications. In this paper, we present DexGraspRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly trains robots in real-world environments to acquire dexterous grasping skills. Specifically, DexGraspRL consists of two stages: (i) a pretraining stage that pretrains the policy using imitation learning (IL) with a limited set of expert demonstrations; (ii) a fine-tuning stage that refines the policy through direct RL in real-world scenarios. To mitigate the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon arising from the distribution shift between demonstrations and real-world environments, we design a regularization term that balances the exploitation of RL with the preservation of the pretrained policy. Our experiments with real-world tasks demonstrate that DexGraspRL successfully accomplishes diverse dexterous grasping tasks, achieving an average success rate of nearly 92%. Furthermore, by fine-tuning with RL, our method uncovers novel policies, surpassing the IL policy with a 23% reduction in average cycle time.</p></details> |  |

Particularly in vision-intensive tasks like geometric reasoning, MLLMs hallucinate frequently, leading to inaccurate reasoning. We attribute this to the perceptual bottleneck in MLLMs, which caps the benefits of reasoning training. To quantify this, we design a Geo-Perception Question-Answering (GeoPQA) benchmark, targeting basic geometric concepts and spatial relationships. Experiments on GeoPQA reveal significant shortcomings of MLLMs in visual perception, which constrain RL reward signals for effective training. To address this bottleneck, we propose a two-stage RL training framework by first enhancing the visual perception of geometric structures, then fostering reasoning capabilities. Applied to Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, our two-stage training improves geometric reasoning by 9.7% and geometric problem solving by 9.1%, compared to the direct reasoning training approach.

Proportional integral derivative controllers remain standard but are highly sensitive to gain selection, with manual tuning often yielding suboptimal trade-offs. This paper studies different optimization techniques for the automated tuning of quadrotor proportional integral derivative gains under a unified simulation that couples a blade element momentum based aerodynamic model with a fast deep neural network surrogate, six degrees of freedom rigid body dynamics, turbulence, and a data driven acoustic surrogate model that predicts third octave spectra and propagates them to ground receivers. We compare three families of gradient-free optimizers: metaheuristics, Bayesian optimization, and deep reinforcement learning. Candidate controllers are evaluated using a composite cost function that incorporates multiple metrics, such as noise footprint and power consumption, simultaneously. Metaheuristics improve performance consistently, with Grey Wolf Optimization producing optimal results. Bayesian optimization is sample efficient but carries higher per iteration overhead and depends on the design domain. The reinforcement learning agents do not surpass the baseline in the current setup, suggesting the problem formulation requires further refinement. On unseen missions the best tuned controller maintains accurate tracking while reducing oscillations, power demand, and acoustic emissions. These results show that noise aware proportional integral derivative tuning through black box search can deliver quieter and more efficient flight without hardware changes.</p></details> | 47 pages, 13 figures |

We present an automated design workflow to create complex and customisable 3D soft sensing structures on demand from 3D scans or models. Compared to the state of the art, our soft liquid metal sensors faithfully recreate complex natural geometries and display excellent sensing properties suitable for validating performance in delicate manipulation tasks. We demonstrate the application of our physical twins as 'sensing corals': high-fidelity, 3D printed replicas of scanned corals that eliminate the need for live coral experimentation, whilst increasing data quality, offering an ethical and scalable pathway for advancing autonomous coral handling and soft manipulation broadly. Through extensive bench-top manipulation and underwater grasping experiments, we show that our sensing coral is able to detect grasps under 0.5 N, effectively capturing the delicate interactions and light contact forces required for coral handling. Finally, we showcase the value of our physical twins across two demonstrations: (i) automated coral labelling for lab identification and (ii) robotic coral aquaculture. Sensing physical twins such as ours can provide richer grasping feedback than conventional sensors providing experimental validation of prior to deployment in handling fragile and delicate items.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Revisiting Bisimulation Metric for Robust Representations in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18519v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks. However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) have shown promise in improving LALMs' reasoning abilities. However, two critical challenges hinder the direct application of RL techniques to Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) tasks: (1) convergence instability caused by ambiguous emotional boundaries and (2) limited reasoning ability when using relatively small models (e.g., 7B-parameter architectures). To overcome these limitations, we introduce EMO-RL, a novel framework incorporating reinforcement learning with two key innovations: Emotion Similarity-Weighted Reward (ESWR) and Explicit Structured Reasoning (ESR). Built upon pretrained LALMs, our method employs group-relative policy optimization with emotion constraints. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our EMO-RL training strategies can significantly enhance the emotional reasoning capabilities of LALMs, attaining state-of-the-art results on both the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets, and cross-dataset experiments prove the strong superiority of generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Findings of 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP Findings 2025)</p></details> |

However, research in this area has been severely hampered by the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets with precise, ground-truth error labels. To address this bottleneck, we introduce \textbf{AEGIS}, a novel framework for \textbf{A}utomated \textbf{E}rror \textbf{G}eneration and \textbf{I}dentification for Multi-Agent \textbf{S}ystems. By systematically injecting controllable and traceable errors into initially successful trajectories, we create a rich dataset of realistic failures. This is achieved using a context-aware, LLM-based adaptive manipulator that performs sophisticated attacks like prompt injection and response corruption to induce specific, predefined error modes. We demonstrate the value of our dataset by exploring three distinct learning paradigms for the error identification task: Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Our comprehensive experiments show that models trained on AEGIS data achieve substantial improvements across all three learning paradigms. Notably, several of our fine-tuned models demonstrate performance competitive with or superior to proprietary systems an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and interpretable multi-agent systems.

Existing motion planning methods often require additional computational effort to generate the final trajectory by solving kinematic or dynamic equations. This paper highlights the strong potential of model-free reinforcement learning methods over model-based approaches for obstacle-free trajectory planning in joint space. We propose a fast trajectory planning system for manipulators that combines vision-based path planning in task space with reinforcement learning-based obstacle avoidance in joint space. We divide the framework into two key components. The first introduces an innovative vision-based trajectory planner in task space, leveraging the large-scale fast segment anything (FSA) model in conjunction with basis spline (B-spline)-optimized kinodynamic path searching. The second component enhances the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm by integrating action ensembles (AE) and policy feedback (PF), which greatly improve precision and stability in goal-reaching and obstacle avoidance within the joint space. These PPO enhancements increase the algorithm's adaptability across diverse robotic tasks, ensuring consistent execution of commands from the first component by the manipulator, while also enhancing both obstacle avoidance efficiency and reaching accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PPO enhancements, as well as simulation-to-simulation (Sim-to-Sim) and simulation-to-reality (Sim-to-Real) transfer, in improving model robustness and planner efficiency in complex scenarios. These enhancements allow the robot to perform obstacle avoidance and real-time trajectory planning in obstructed environments.

| **[Correlation or Causation: Analyzing the Causal Structures of LLM and LRM Reasoning Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17380v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs suffer from critical reasoning issues such as unfaithfulness, bias, and inconsistency, since they lack robust causal underpinnings and may rely on superficial correlations rather than genuine understanding. Successive LRMs have emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging advanced training techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) and distillation to improve task accuracy. However, the impact of these training methods on causality remains largely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a systematic causal analysis on LLMs and LRMs, examining structural causal models (SCMs) of four key variables: problem instruction (Z), thinking process (T), reasoning steps (X), and answer (Y). Our findings reveal that RLVR-trained LRMs exhibit enhanced causal reasoning capabilities, aligning more closely with ideal causal structures, while LLMs and distilled LRMs fail to address causality-related deficiencies. Our further investigation indicates that RLVR reduces spurious correlations and strengthens genuine causal patterns, thereby mitigating unfaithfulness and bias. In addition, our inspection on the dynamics of the RLVR training process observes a high correlation between reduced spurious features and improved causal structures, where the causal relationships consistently improve in the training process. This study contributes to the understanding of causality in reasoning models, highlights the critical role of RLVR in enhancing causal reasoning, and provides insights for designing future AI systems with stronger causal foundations. We release our code and data at https://github.com/Harryking1999/CoT_Causal_Analysis.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in MVRL focus on extracting latent representations from multiview observations and leveraging them in control tasks. However, it is not straightforward to learn compact and task-relevant representations, particularly in the presence of redundancy, distracting information, or missing views. In this paper, we propose Multi-view Fusion State for Control (MFSC), firstly incorporating bisimulation metric learning into MVRL to learn task-relevant representations. Furthermore, we propose a multiview-based mask and latent reconstruction auxiliary task that exploits shared information across views and improves MFSC's robustness in missing views by introducing a mask token. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in MVRL tasks. Even in more realistic scenarios with interference or missing views, MFSC consistently maintains high performance.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that serves as both a benchmark and evaluation environment for multimodal clinical reasoning in the radiology ecosystem. The proposed framework integrates large language models (LLMs) and large vision models (LVMs) within a modular architecture composed of ten specialized agents responsible for image analysis, feature extraction, report generation, review, and evaluation. This design enables fine-grained assessment at both the agent level (e.g., detection and segmentation accuracy) and the consensus level (e.g., report quality and clinical relevance). We demonstrate an implementation using chatGPT-4o on public radiology datasets, where LLMs act as evaluators alongside medical radiologist feedback. By aligning evaluation protocols with the LLM development lifecycle, including pretraining, finetuning, alignment, and deployment, the proposed benchmark establishes a path toward trustworthy deviance-based radiology report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS2025 Workshop: Evaluating the Evolving LLM Lifecycle: Benchmarks, Emergent Abilities, and Scaling</p></details> |

Prior methods often rely on dynamics models, strong priors, or depth sensing, limiting generalization and naturalness. We present DyDexHandover, a novel framework that employs multi-agent reinforcement learning to train an end to end RGB based policy for bimanual object throwing and catching. To achieve more human-like behavior, the throwing policy is guided by a human policy regularization scheme, encouraging fluid and natural motion, and enhancing the generalization capability of the policy. A dual arm simulation environment was built in Isaac Sim for experimental evaluation. DyDexHandover achieves nearly 99 percent success on training objects and 75 percent on unseen objects, while generating human-like throwing and catching behaviors. To our knowledge, it is the first method to realize dual-arm in-air handover using only raw RGB perception.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Mano Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17336v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are the primary medium for human-computer interaction, yet automating GUI interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of visual elements, dynamic environments, and the need for multi-step reasoning. Existing methods based on vision-language models (VLMs) often suffer from limited resolution, domain mismatch, and insufficient sequential decisionmaking capability. To address these issues, we propose Mano, a robust GUI agent built upon a multi-modal foundation model pre-trained on extensive web and computer system data. Our approach integrates a novel simulated environment for high-fidelity data generation, a three-stage training pipeline (supervised fine-tuning, offline reinforcement learning, and online reinforcement learning), and a verification module for error recovery. Mano demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple GUI benchmarks, including Mind2Web and OSWorld, achieving significant improvements in success rate and operational accuracy. Our work provides new insights into the effective integration of reinforcement learning with VLMs for practical GUI agent deployment, highlighting the importance of domain-specific data, iterative training, and holistic reward design.</p></details> |  |
| **[SparseDoctor: Towards Efficient Chat Doctor with Mixture of Experts Enhanced Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14269v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in medical question answering and clinical decision-making, promoting the efficiency and popularization of the personalized virtual doctor in society. However, the traditional fine-tuning strategies on LLM require the updates of billions of parameters, substantially increasing the training cost, including the training time and utility cost. To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the current medical LLMs and explore the boundary of the representation capability of the LLMs on the medical domain, apart from the traditional fine-tuning strategies from the data perspective (i.e., supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback), we instead craft a novel sparse medical LLM named SparseDoctor armed with contrastive learning enhanced LoRA-MoE (low rank adaptation-mixture of experts) architecture. To this end, the crafted automatic routing mechanism can scientifically allocate the computational resources among different LoRA experts supervised by the contrastive learning. Additionally, we also introduce a novel expert memory queue mechanism to further boost the efficiency of the overall framework and prevent the memory overflow during training. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on three typical medical benchmarks: CMB, CMExam, and CMMLU-Med. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LLM can consistently outperform the strong baselines such as the HuatuoGPT series.</p></details> |  |

However, current training practices largely rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over static trajectories or reinforcement learning (RL) on narrow tasks, and generalize poorly beyond development settings, leading to brittleness with new tools and unseen workflows. Because code execution reflects many structures of real-world workflows, coding problems provide a natural basis for building agent training environments. Motivated by this, we introduce CodeGym, a scalable framework that synthesizes diverse, verifiable, and controllable multi-turn tool-use environments for agent RL, enabling LLM agents to explore and master various workflows actively. CodeGym rewrites static coding problems into interactive environments by extracting atomic functions or logic into callable tools, yielding verifiable tasks that span various tool-execution workflows. Models of varying sizes and chain-of-thought configurations, trained in CodeGym, exhibit consistent out-of-distribution generalizability; for example, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct achieves an absolute accuracy gain of 8.7 points on the OOD benchmark $\tau$-Bench. These results highlight CodeGym as a step toward scalable general-purpose RL environments that align with real-world agent workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages.

While recent frameworks based on Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) can accelerate the solving process, their performance is often constrained by the difficulty in generating sufficiently effective neighborhoods. To address this challenge, we propose HyP-ASO, a hybrid policy-based adaptive search optimization framework that combines a customized formula with deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). The formula leverages feasible solutions to calculate the selection probabilities for each variable in the neighborhood generation process, and the RL policy network predicts the neighborhood size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyP-ASO significantly outperforms existing LNS-based approaches for large-scale ILPs. Additional experiments show it is lightweight and highly scalable, making it well-suited for solving large-scale ILPs.</p></details> |  |

Automated log anomaly detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability of modern software systems. However, existing approaches face significant limitations: traditional deep learning models lack interpretability and generalization, while methods leveraging Large Language Models are often hindered by unreliability and factual inaccuracies. To address these issues, we propose RationAnomaly, a novel framework that enhances log anomaly detection by synergizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning with reinforcement learning. Our approach first instills expert-like reasoning patterns using CoT-guided supervised fine-tuning, grounded in a high-quality dataset corrected through a rigorous expert-driven process. Subsequently, a reinforcement learning phase with a multi-faceted reward function optimizes for accuracy and logical consistency, effectively mitigating hallucinations. Experimentally, RationAnomaly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior F1-scores on key benchmarks while providing transparent, step-by-step analytical outputs. We have released the corresponding resources, including code and datasets.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL), a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework: (1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named BTL-UI, which demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across both static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Each representation has both limitations and unique features. Choosing the best representation for one task is often a difficult chore, and there exist conflicting opinions on which representation is better suited for a set of family of tasks. Even worse, when dealing with scenarios where we need to learn or optimize functions with orientations as inputs and/or outputs, the set of possibilities (representations, loss functions, etc.) is even larger and it is not easy to decide what is best for each scenario. In this paper, we attempt to a) present clearly, concisely and with unified notation all available representations, and "tricks" related to 3D orientations (including Lie Group algebra), and b) benchmark them in representative scenarios. The first part feels like it is missing from the robotics literature as one has to read many different textbooks and papers in order have a concise and clear understanding of all possibilities, while the benchmark is necessary in order to come up with recommendations based on empirical evidence. More precisely, we experiment with the following settings that attempt to cover most widely used scenarios in robotics: 1) direct optimization, 2) imitation/supervised learning with a neural network controller, 3) reinforcement learning, and 4) trajectory optimization using differential dynamic programming. We finally provide guidelines depending on the scenario, and make available a reference implementation of all the orientation math described.</p></details> | 9 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Post-hoc Reward Calibration: A Case Study on Length Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17407v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback aligns the outputs of Large Language Models with human values and preferences. Central to this process is the reward model (RM), which translates human feedback into training signals for optimising LLM behaviour. However, RMs can develop biases by exploiting spurious correlations in their training data, such as favouring outputs based on length or style rather than true quality. These biases can lead to incorrect output rankings, sub-optimal model evaluations, and the amplification of undesirable behaviours in LLMs alignment. This paper addresses the challenge of correcting such biases without additional data and training, introducing the concept of Post-hoc Reward Calibration. We first propose an intuitive approach to estimate the bias term and, thus, remove it to approximate the underlying true reward. We then extend the approach to a more general and robust form with the Locally Weighted Regression. Focusing on the prevalent length bias, we validate our proposed approaches across three experimental settings, demonstrating consistent improvements: (1) a 3.11 average performance gain across 33 reward models on the RewardBench dataset; (2) enhanced alignment of RM rankings with GPT-4 evaluations and human preferences based on the AlpacaEval benchmark; and (3) improved Length-Controlled win rate of the RLHF process in multiple LLM--RM combinations. Our method is computationally efficient and generalisable to other types of bias and RMs, offering a scalable and robust solution for mitigating biases in LLM alignment.

In this work we present a new approach to constraint satisfaction and optimization in dynamically changing environments, particularly when variables in the problem are statistically independent. We frame it as a reinforcement learning problem and introduce a conditional policy generator by borrowing the idea of class conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). Assuming that the problem includes both static and dynamic constraints, the former are used in a reward formulation to guide the policy training such that it learns to map to a probabilistic distribution of solutions satisfying static constraints from a noise prior, which is similar to a generator in GANs. On the other hand, dynamic constraints in the problem are encoded to different class labels and fed with the input noise. The policy is then simultaneously updated for maximum likelihood of correctly classifying given the dynamic conditions in a supervised manner. We empirically demonstrate a proof-of-principle experiment with a multi-modal constraint satisfaction problem and compare between unconditional and conditional cases.</p></details> |  |

Offline Imitation learning (IL) avoids these risks by collecting expert demonstrations safely, training entirely offline, and deploying policies zero-shot. However, we find that naively applying Behaviour Cloning (BC) to social navigation is insufficient; achieving strong performance requires careful architectural and training choices. We present Ratatouille, a pipeline and model architecture that, without changing the data, reduces collisions per meter by 6 times and improves success rate by 3 times compared to naive BC. We validate our approach in both simulation and the real world, where we collected over 11 hours of data on a dense university campus. We further demonstrate qualitative results in a public food court. Our findings highlight that thoughtful IL design, rather than additional data, can substantially improve safety and reliability in real-world social navigation. Video: https://youtu.be/tOdLTXsaYLQ.

However, recent advancements in game AI based on reinforcement learning have predominantly focused on improving proficiency, whereas methods based on evolution algorithms generate agents with diverse play styles but exhibit subpar performance compared to RL methods. To address this gap, this paper proposes Mixed Proximal Policy Optimization (MPPO), a method designed to improve the proficiency of existing suboptimal agents while retaining their distinct styles. MPPO unifies loss objectives for both online and offline samples and introduces an implicit constraint to approximate demonstrator policies by adjusting the empirical distribution of samples. Empirical results across environments of varying scales demonstrate that MPPO achieves proficiency levels comparable to, or even superior to, pure online algorithms while preserving demonstrators' play styles. This work presents an effective approach for generating highly proficient and diverse game agents, ultimately contributing to more engaging gameplay experiences.</p></details> |  |

Transformer-based HPO methods have shown great potential; however, existing approaches rely heavily on large-scale historical optimization trajectories and lack effective reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, thereby limiting their efficiency and performance improvements. Inspired by the success of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in large language models (LLMs), we propose GRPOformer -- a novel hyperparameter optimization framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with Transformers. In GRPOformer, Transformers are employed to generate new hyperparameter configurations from historical optimization trajectories, while GRPO enables rapid trajectory construction and optimization strategy learning from scratch. Moreover, we introduce Policy Churn Regularization (PCR) to enhance the stability of GRPO training. Experimental results on OpenML demonstrate that GRPOformer consistently outperforms baseline methods across diverse tasks, offering new insights into the application of RL for HPO.</p></details> |  |

However, these two capabilities are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain narrow in scope -- typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval settings and task-specific constraints. This lack of integration constrains generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical, and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR$^2$ (built on Qwen-2.5-3/7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several benchmarks.

While tabular settings benefit from well-understood hardness measures like MDP diameter and suboptimality gaps, deep RL benchmarks are often chosen based on intuition and popularity. This raises a critical question: can tabular hardness metrics be adapted to guide non-tabular benchmarking? We investigate this question and reveal a fundamental gap. Our primary contribution is demonstrating that the difficulty of non-tabular environments is dominated by a factor that tabular metrics ignore: representation hardness. The same underlying MDP can pose vastly different challenges depending on whether the agent receives state vectors or pixel-based observations. To enable this analysis, we introduce \texttt{pharos}, a new open-source library for principled RL benchmarking that allows for systematic control over both environment structure and agent representations. Our extensive case study using \texttt{pharos} shows that while tabular metrics offer some insight, they are poor predictors of deep RL agent performance on their own. This work highlights the urgent need for new, representation-aware hardness measures and positions \texttt{pharos} as a key tool for developing them.</p></details> |  |

However, a critical bottleneck lies in the manual engineering of reward functions and training curricula for complex and dynamic driving tasks, which is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. To address this problem, we propose OGR (Orchestrate, Generate, Reflect), a novel automated driving policy learning framework that leverages vision-language model (VLM)-based multi-agent collaboration. Our framework capitalizes on advanced reasoning and multimodal understanding capabilities of VLMs to construct a hierarchical agent system. Specifically, a centralized orchestrator plans high-level training objectives, while a generation module employs a two-step analyze-then-generate process for efficient generation of reward-curriculum pairs. A reflection module then facilitates iterative optimization based on the online evaluation. Furthermore, a dedicated memory module endows the VLM agents with the capabilities of long-term memory. To enhance robustness and diversity of the generation process, we introduce a parallel generation scheme and a human-in-the-loop technique for augmentation of the reward observation space. Through efficient multi-agent cooperation and leveraging rich multimodal information, OGR enables the online evolution of reinforcement learning policies to acquire interaction-aware driving skills. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator demonstrate the superior performance, robust generalizability across distinct urban scenarios, and strong compatibility with various RL algorithms. Further real-world experiments highlight the practical viability and effectiveness of our framework. The source code will be available upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |

We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches: sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming, we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces three key innovations: (i) a trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; (ii) a noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later phases; and (iii) a seed group strategy that controls for initialization effects to isolate exploration contributions. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art performance in human preference alignment and text-to-image benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[RIFT: Group-Relative RL Fine-Tuning for Realistic and Controllable Traffic Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03344v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving both realism and controllability in closed-loop traffic simulation remains a key challenge in autonomous driving. Dataset-based methods reproduce realistic trajectories but suffer from covariate shift in closed-loop deployment, compounded by simplified dynamics models that further reduce reliability. Conversely, physics-based simulation methods enhance reliable and controllable closed-loop interactions but often lack expert demonstrations, compromising realism. To address these challenges, we introduce a dual-stage AV-centric simulation framework that conducts imitation learning pre-training in a data-driven simulator to capture trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability, followed by reinforcement learning fine-tuning in a physics-based simulator to enhance style-level controllability and mitigate covariate shift. In the fine-tuning stage, we propose RIFT, a novel group-relative RL fine-tuning strategy that evaluates all candidate modalities through group-relative formulation and employs a surrogate objective for stable optimization, enhancing style-level controllability and mitigating covariate shift while preserving the trajectory-level realism and route-level controllability inherited from IL pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFT improves realism and controllability in traffic simulation while simultaneously exposing the limitations of modern AV systems in closed-loop evaluation.

| **[Preference Distillation via Value based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16965v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a powerful paradigm to align language models with human preferences using pairwise comparisons. However, its binary win-or-loss supervision often proves insufficient for training small models with limited capacity. Prior works attempt to distill information from large teacher models using behavior cloning or KL divergence. These methods often focus on mimicking current behavior and overlook distilling reward modeling. To address this issue, we propose \textit{Teacher Value-based Knowledge Distillation} (TVKD), which introduces an auxiliary reward from the value function of the teacher model to provide a soft guide. This auxiliary reward is formulated to satisfy potential-based reward shaping, ensuring that the global reward structure and optimal policy of DPO are preserved. TVKD can be integrated into the standard DPO training framework and does not require additional rollouts. Our experimental results show that TVKD consistently improves performance across various benchmarks and model sizes.</p></details> | 20 page |

However, existing works mainly focus on pixel-level triggers that are impractical to deploy in the real world. We address this gap by introducing a novel backdoor attack against the end-to-end AD systems that leverage one or more other vehicles' trajectories as triggers. To generate precise trigger trajectories, we first use temporal logic (TL) specifications to define the behaviors of attacker vehicles. Configurable behavior models are then used to generate these trajectories, which are quantitatively evaluated and iteratively refined based on the TL specifications. We further develop a negative training strategy by incorporating patch trajectories that are similar to triggers but are designated not to activate the backdoor. It enhances the stealthiness of the attack and refines the system's responses to trigger scenarios. Through extensive experiments on 5 offline reinforcement learning (RL) driving agents with 6 trigger patterns and target action combinations, we demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our proposed attack, showing the under-exploration of existing end-to-end AD systems' vulnerabilities to such trajectory-based backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often rely on static modality fusion strategies and neglect the spatial cues embedded in stereo audio, leading to performance degradation in cluttered or occluded scenes. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning-based AVN framework with two key innovations: (1) a \textbf{S}tereo-Aware \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{M}odule (\textbf{SAM}), which learns and exploits the spatial disparity between left and right audio channels to enhance directional sound perception; and (2) an \textbf{A}udio-\textbf{G}uided \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{F}usion Module (\textbf{AGDF}), which dynamically adjusts the fusion ratio between visual and auditory features based on audio cues, thereby improving robustness to environmental changes. Extensive experiments are conducted on two realistic 3D scene datasets, Replica and Matterport3D, demonstrating that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of navigation success rate and path efficiency. Notably, our model achieves over 40\% improvement under audio-only conditions compared to the best-performing baselines. These results highlight the importance of explicitly modeling spatial cues from stereo channels and performing deep multi-modal fusion for robust and efficient audio-visual navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper (14 pages).

| **[LLMs as Layout Designers: A Spatial Reasoning Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16891v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning and planning abilities in textual domains and can effectively follow instructions for complex tasks, their capacity for spatial understanding and reasoning remains limited. Such capabilities, however, are critical for applications like content-aware graphic layout design, which demands precise placement, alignment, and structural organization of multiple elements within constrained visual spaces. To address this gap, we propose LaySPA, a reinforcement learning-based framework that augments LLM agents with explicit spatial reasoning capabilities. LaySPA leverages hybrid reward signals that capture geometric validity, structural fidelity, and visual quality, enabling agents to model inter-element relationships, navigate the canvas, and optimize spatial arrangements. Through iterative self-exploration and adaptive policy optimization, LaySPA produces both interpretable reasoning traces and structured layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that LaySPA generates structurally sound and visually appealing layouts, outperforming larger general-purpose LLMs and achieving results on par with state-of-the-art specialized layout models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can GRPO Boost Complex Multimodal Table Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16889v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing table understanding methods face challenges due to complex table structures and intricate logical reasoning. While supervised finetuning (SFT) dominates existing research, reinforcement learning (RL), such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has shown promise but struggled with low initial policy accuracy and coarse rewards in tabular contexts. In this paper, we introduce Table-R1, a three-stage RL framework that enhances multimodal table understanding through: (1) Warm-up that prompts initial perception and reasoning capabilities, (2) Perception Alignment GRPO (PA-GRPO), which employs continuous Tree-Edit-Distance Similarity (TEDS) rewards for recognizing table structures and contents, and (3) Hint-Completion GRPO (HC-GRPO), which utilizes fine-grained rewards of residual steps based on the hint-guided question. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Table-R1 can boost the model's table reasoning performance obviously on both held-in and held-out datasets, outperforming SFT and GRPO largely. Notably, Qwen2-VL-7B with Table-R1 surpasses larger specific table understanding models (e.g., Table-LLaVA 13B), even achieving comparable performance to the closed-source model GPT-4o on held-in datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of each stage of Table-R1 in overcoming initialization bottlenecks and reward sparsity, thereby advancing robust multimodal table understanding.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

However, only limited research has explored the training of DRL models with real-world data in practical, distributed Internet of Things (IoT) systems. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework for training DRL models in real-world distributed IoT environments. In the proposed framework, IoT devices select communication channels using a DRL-based method, while the DRL model is trained with feedback information. Specifically, Acknowledgment (ACK) information is obtained from actual data transmissions over the selected channels. Implementation and performance evaluation, in terms of Frame Success Rate (FSR), are carried out, demonstrating both the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Intriguingly, we discover that off-the-shelf MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) demonstrate powerful inherent modality alignment properties. While recent MLLM-based retrievers with unified architectures partially mitigate this gap, their reliance on coarse modality alignment mechanisms fundamentally limits their potential. In this work, We introduce MAPLE (Modality-Aligned Preference Learning for Embeddings), a novel framework that leverages the fine grained alignment priors inherent in MLLM to guide cross modal representation learning. MAPLE formulates the learning process as reinforcement learning with two key components: (1) Automatic preference data construction using off-the-shelf MLLM, and (2) a new Relative Preference Alignment (RPA) loss, which adapts Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to the embedding learning setting. Experimental results show that our preference-guided alignment achieves substantial gains in fine-grained cross-modal retrieval, underscoring its effectiveness in handling nuanced semantic distinctions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Speculative Agent Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01920v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their remarkable success in complex tasks propelling widespread adoption, large language-model-based agents still face critical deployment challenges due to prohibitive latency and inference costs. While recent work has explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches suffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance fidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur excessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or any point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks demonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to 60%. Our code and data are available through https://github.com/guanyilin428/Dynamic-Speculative-Planning.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Large Language Models as End-to-end Combinatorial Optimization Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16865v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, central to decision-making scenarios like logistics and manufacturing, are traditionally solved using problem-specific algorithms requiring significant domain expertise. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating CO problem solving, existing approaches rely on intermediate steps such as code generation or solver invocation, limiting their generality and accessibility. This paper introduces a novel framework that empowers LLMs to serve as end-to-end CO solvers by directly mapping natural language problem descriptions to solutions. We propose a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) imparts LLMs with solution generation patterns from domain-specific solvers, while a feasibility-and-optimality-aware reinforcement learning (FOARL) process explicitly mitigates constraint violations and refines solution quality. Evaluation across seven NP-hard CO problems shows that our method achieves a high feasibility rate and reduces the average optimality gap to 1.03-8.20% by tuning a 7B-parameter LLM, surpassing both general-purpose LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), and domain-specific heuristics. Our method establishes a unified language-based pipeline for CO without extensive code execution or manual architectural adjustments for different problems, offering a general and language-driven alternative to traditional solver design while maintaining relative feasibility guarantees.</p></details> |  |

However, developing such capabilities through online reinforcement learning is sometimes impractical due to the prohibitive cost of data collection and the risk of generating unsafe behaviors. In this paper, we study the use of offline reinforcement learning as a practical and efficient alternative. This technique uses pre-collected data to enable emotion-adaptive social robots. We present a system architecture that integrates multimodal sensing and recognition, decision-making, and adaptive responses. Using a limited dataset from a human-robot game-playing scenario, we establish a benchmark for comparing offline reinforcement learning algorithms that do not require an online environment. Our results show that BCQ and CQL are more robust to data sparsity, achieving higher state-action values compared to NFQ, DQN, and DDQN. This work establishes a foundation for benchmarking offline RL in emotion-adaptive robotics and informs future deployment in real-world HRI. Our findings provide empirical insight into the performance of offline reinforcement learning algorithms in data-constrained HRI. This work establishes a foundation for benchmarking offline RL in emotion-adaptive robotics and informs its future deployment in real-world HRI, such as in conversational agents, educational partners, and personal assistants, require reliable emotional responsiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to conference</p></details> |

We demonstrate that this human motion-informed prior allows RL to discover solutions unattainable by direct RL, and that diffusion models inherently promote natural looking motions, aiding in sim-to-real transfer.

We can further break down the problem into (1) data sparsity from the angle of data representation and (2) data scarcity from the angle of data quantity. In this thesis, I will discuss selected works on two domains: (1) tactile sensing and (2) rehabilitation robots, which are exemplars of data sparsity and scarcity, respectively. Tactile sensing is an essential modality for robotics, but tactile data are often sparse, and for each interaction with the physical world, tactile sensors can only obtain information about the local area of contact. I will discuss my work on learning vision-free tactile-only exploration and manipulation policies through model-free reinforcement learning to make efficient use of sparse tactile information. On the other hand, rehabilitation robots are an example of data scarcity to the extreme due to the significant challenge of collecting biosignals from disabled-bodied subjects at scale for training. I will discuss my work in collaboration with the medical school and clinicians on intent inferral for stroke survivors, where a hand orthosis developed in our lab collects a set of biosignals from the patient and uses them to infer the activity that the patient intends to perform, so the orthosis can provide the right type of physical assistance at the right moment. My work develops machine learning algorithms that enable intent inferral with minimal data, including semi-supervised, meta-learning, and generative AI methods.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a case study demonstrating the practical advantages of reinforcement learning in addressing this challenge. We introduce a high-fidelity simulation environment that captures realistic operational constraints, within which a decision-level reinforcement learning agent learns to coordinate multiple effectors for optimal interception prioritization. Operating in a discrete action space, the agent selects which drone to engage per effector based on observed state features such as positions, classes, and effector status. We evaluate the learned policy against a handcrafted rule-based baseline across hundreds of simulated attack scenarios. The reinforcement learning based policy consistently achieves lower average damage and higher defensive efficiency in protecting critical zones. This case study highlights the potential of reinforcement learning as a strategic layer within defense architectures, enhancing resilience without displacing existing control systems. All code and simulation assets are publicly released for full reproducibility, and a video demonstration illustrates the policy's qualitative behavior.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

We present HDMI (HumanoiD iMitation for Interaction), a simple and general framework that learns whole-body humanoid-object interaction skills directly from monocular RGB videos. Our pipeline (i) extracts and retargets human and object trajectories from unconstrained videos to build structured motion datasets, (ii) trains a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to co-track robot and object states with three key designs: a unified object representation, a residual action space, and a general interaction reward, and (iii) zero-shot deploys the RL policies on real humanoid robots.

Solving VRP in real-time at large scale has become critical in numerous applications, from growing markets like last-mile delivery to emerging use-cases like interactive logistics planning. In many applications, one has to repeatedly solve VRP instances drawn from the same distribution, yet current state-of-the-art solvers treat each instance on its own without leveraging previous examples. We introduce an optimization framework where a reinforcement learning agent is trained on prior instances and quickly generates initial solutions, which are then further optimized by a genetic algorithm. This framework, Evolutionary Algorithm with Reinforcement Learning Initialization (EARLI), consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art solvers across various time budgets. For example, EARLI handles vehicle routing with 500 locations within one second, 10x faster than current solvers for the same solution quality, enabling real-time and interactive routing at scale. EARLI can generalize to new data, as we demonstrate on real e-commerce delivery data of a previously unseen city. By combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms, our hybrid framework takes a step forward to closer interdisciplinary collaboration between AI and optimization communities towards real-time optimization in diverse domains.</p></details> |  |

Linear temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements, yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{SMART} (Sycophancy Mitigation through Adaptive Reasoning Trajectories), which reframes sycophancy as a \textit{reasoning optimization problem} rather than an output alignment issue. SMART is a two-stage framework comprising: (1) Uncertainty-Aware Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree Search (UA-MCTS), which dynamically adjusts model exploration based on state-level uncertainty to collect high-quality, diverse reasoning trajectories alongside both stepwise progress and final outcome rewards; and (2) progress-based reinforcement learning, which fine-tunes the model using the collected trajectories and reward signals to reinforce effective reasoning patterns. Through extensive experiments, we show that SMART significantly reduces sycophantic behavior while preserving strong performance on out-of-distribution inputs and maintaining general capabilities. These results underscore the importance of optimizing internal reasoning mechanisms to build more truthful and aligned AI assistants.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate how context length and the complexity of training data influence the RL scaling training process of R1-distilled reasoning models, e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Our experimental results reveal that: (1) simply controlling the context length and curating the training data based on the input prompt length can effectively improve the training efficiency of RL scaling, achieving better performance with more concise CoT; (2) properly scaling the context length helps mitigate entropy collapse; and (3) carefully choosing the context length facilitates achieving efficient LLM training and reasoning. Inspired by these insights, we propose FastCuRL, a curriculum RL framework with stage-wise context scaling to achieve efficient LLM training and reasoning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FastCuRL-1.5B-V3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on five competition-level benchmarks and achieves 49.6% accuracy on AIME 2024. Furthermore, FastCuRL-1.5B-Preview surpasses DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview on five benchmarks while only using a single node with 8 GPUs and a total of 50% of training steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

When dealing with distributed, high-dimensional problems in state and control variables, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been proposed as a scalable approach for breaking the curse of dimensionality. In particular, through decentralized training and execution, multiple agents cooperate to steer the system towards a target configuration, relying solely on local state and reward information. However, the principle of locality may become a limiting factor whenever a collective, nonlocal behavior of the agents is crucial to maximize the reward function, as typically happens in PDE-constrained optimal control problems. In this work, we propose HypeMARL: a decentralized MARL algorithm tailored to the control of high-dimensional, parametric, and distributed systems. HypeMARL employs hypernetworks to effectively parametrize the agents' policies and value functions with respect to the system parameters and the agents' relative positions, encoded by sinusoidal positional encoding. Through the application on challenging control problems, such as density and flow control, we show that HypeMARL (i) can effectively control systems through a collective behavior of the agents, outperforming state-of-the-art decentralized MARL, (ii) can efficiently deal with parametric dependencies, (iii) requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and (iv) can reduce the amount of expensive environment interactions by a factor of ~10 thanks to its model-based extension, MB-HypeMARL, which relies on computationally efficient deep learning-based surrogate models approximating the dynamics locally, with minimal deterioration of the policy performance.</p></details> |  |

Although existing surveys offer overviews of RL augmented LLMs, their scope is often limited, failing to provide a comprehensive summary of how RL operates across the full lifecycle of LLMs. We systematically review the theoretical and practical advancements whereby RL empowers LLMs, especially Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). First, we briefly introduce the basic theory of RL. Second, we thoroughly detail application strategies for RL across various phases of the LLM lifecycle, including pre-training, alignment fine-tuning, and reinforced reasoning. In particular, we emphasize that RL methods in the reinforced reasoning phase serve as a pivotal driving force for advancing model reasoning to its limits. Next, we collate existing datasets and evaluation benchmarks currently used for RL fine-tuning, spanning human-annotated datasets, AI-assisted preference data, and program-verification-style corpora. Subsequently, we review the mainstream open-source tools and training frameworks available, providing clear practical references for subsequent research. Finally, we analyse the future challenges and trends in the field of RL-enhanced LLMs. This survey aims to present researchers and practitioners with the latest developments and frontier trends at the intersection of RL and LLMs, with the goal of fostering the evolution of LLMs that are more intelligent, generalizable, and secure.</p></details> | <details><summary>A Sur...</summary><p>A Survey of Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models</p></details> |
| **[Safe Guaranteed Dynamics Exploration with Probabilistic Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16650v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring both optimality and safety is critical for the real-world deployment of agents, but becomes particularly challenging when the system dynamics are unknown. To address this problem, we introduce a notion of maximum safe dynamics learning via sufficient exploration in the space of safe policies. We propose a $\textit{pessimistically}$ safe framework that $\textit{optimistically}$ explores informative states and, despite not reaching them due to model uncertainty, ensures continuous online learning of dynamics. The framework achieves first-of-its-kind results: learning the dynamics model sufficiently $-$ up to an arbitrary small tolerance (subject to noise) $-$ in a finite time, while ensuring provably safe operation throughout with high probability and without requiring resets. Building on this, we propose an algorithm to maximize rewards while learning the dynamics $\textit{only to the extent needed}$ to achieve close-to-optimal performance. Unlike typical reinforcement learning (RL) methods, our approach operates online in a non-episodic setting and ensures safety throughout the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in challenging domains such as autonomous car racing and drone navigation under aerodynamic effects $-$ scenarios where safety is critical and accurate modeling is difficult.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods leverage the commonsense knowledge and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) to guide exploration toward more meaningful states. However, LLMs can produce plans that are semantically plausible yet physically infeasible, yielding unreliable behavior. We introduce LLM-TALE, a framework that uses LLMs' planning to directly steer RL exploration. LLM-TALE integrates planning at both the task level and the affordance level, improving learning efficiency by directing agents toward semantically meaningful actions. Unlike prior approaches that assume optimal LLM-generated plans or rewards, LLM-TALE corrects suboptimality online and explores multimodal affordance-level plans without human supervision. We evaluate LLM-TALE on pick-and-place tasks in standard RL benchmarks, observing improvements in both sample efficiency and success rates over strong baselines. Real-robot experiments indicate promising zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. Code and supplementary material are available at https://llm-tale.github.io.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Existing methods often assume static neighborhoods, limiting adaptability to dynamic or heterogeneous environments. While centralized frameworks can learn dynamic graphs, their reliance on global state access and centralized infrastructure is impractical in real-world decentralized systems. We propose a stochastic graph-based policy for Networked-MARL, where each agent conditions its decision on a sampled subgraph over its local physical neighborhood. Building on this formulation, we introduce BayesG, a decentralized actor-framework that learns sparse, context-aware interaction structures via Bayesian variational inference. Each agent operates over an ego-graph and samples a latent communication mask to guide message passing and policy computation. The variational distribution is trained end-to-end alongside the policy using an evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective, enabling agents to jointly learn both interaction topology and decision-making strategies. BayesG outperforms strong MARL baselines on large-scale traffic control tasks with up to 167 agents, demonstrating superior scalability, efficiency, and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

By decoupling large model functions into reasoning, generation and retrieval modules, and combining reinforcement learning-driven dynamic routing algorithms and task adaptation mechanisms, the systematic integration of control theory and large model dynamic reasoning is achieved for the first time. Experiments show that the MCP framework improves the performance of cross-modal benchmarking tasks, such as GLUE, COCO, ScienceQA, etc., by 15-30% compared with the baseline model, improves the reasoning efficiency by 40%, and generates the interpretable intermediate results through the Presenter layer, obtaining 90% of the manual interpretability scores, which provides a brand-new technological path to solve the bottleneck of the practical application of the large model.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we introduce Heterogeneous Adaptive Policy Optimization (HAPO), a comprehensive token-aware algorithm that dynamically adapts optimization based on token entropy. For rollout sampling, we propose Adaptive Temperature Sampling, which adjusts sampling temperature in real time, promoting exploration at high-entropy tokens while preserving coherence at low-entropy ones. For advantage calculation, we introduce Token Level Group Average that normalizes advantages at token level, jointly accounting for sequence-length as in token-mean loss while preserving non-biased treatment. We then develop Differential Advantage Redistribution that leverages entropy and importance ratios to modulate rewards-adjusting updates for tokens with clear signals. For clipping loss, we design Asymmetric Adaptive Clipping, allowing aggressive probability reduction for noisy low-entropy tokens while enabling exploration for high-entropy tokens. Through systematic investigation between entropy and training dynamics, we embedded token-level treatment into every stages to achieve fine-grained control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAPO consistently outperforms DAPO across multiple model scales. Our code can be found in https://github.com/starriver030515/HAPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoRFT: Incentivizing Video Reasoning Capability in MLLMs via Reinforced Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12434v3)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has shown great promise in achieving humanlevel reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), and has recently been extended to MLLMs. Nevertheless, reasoning about videos, which is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, remains a persistent challenge due to the complex logic, temporal and causal structures inherent in video data. To fill this gap, we propose VIDEORFT, a novel approach that extends the RFT paradigm to cultivate human-like video reasoning capabilities in MLLMs. VIDEORFT follows the standard two-stage scheme in RFT: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to improve generalization. A central challenge to achieve this in the video domain lies in the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality video CoT datasets. We address this by building a multi-expert, cognition-inspired CoT curation pipeline. First, we devise a cognition-inspired prompting strategy to elicit a reasoning LLM to generate preliminary CoTs based solely on rich, structured, and literal representations of video content. Subsequently, these CoTs are revised by a MLLM conditioned on the actual video, ensuring visual consistency and reducing visual hallucinations. This pipeline results in two new datasets, i.e.VideoRFT-CoT-102K for SFT and VideoRFT-RL-310K for RL. To further strengthen the RL phase, we introduce a novel semantic-consistency reward that explicitly promotes the alignment between textual reasoning and visual evidence. This reward encourages the model to produce coherent, context-aware reasoning outputs grounded in visual input. Extensive experiments show that VIDEORFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six video reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025.

Addressing this gap requires a systematic approach that involves a capable base model, high-quality reasoning-oriented audio data, and effective training algorithms. In this work, we present a comprehensive solution for audio logical reasoning (ALR) tasks: we introduce SoundMind, a dataset of 6,446 audio-text annotated samples specifically curated to support complex reasoning. Building on this resource, we propose SoundMind-RL, a rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to equip audio-language models with robust audio-text reasoning capabilities. By fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on the proposed SoundMind dataset using SoundMind-RL, we achieve strong and consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on the SoundMind benchmark. This work highlights the benefit of combining high-quality, reasoning-focused datasets with specialized RL techniques, and contributes to advancing auditory intelligence in language models.

To address the resulting challenges for utilities and system operators, we extend ExaDigiT, an open-source digital twin framework for modeling power, cooling, and scheduling of supercomputers. Originally developed for replaying traces from leadership-class HPC systems, ExaDigiT now incorporates heterogeneity, multi-tenancy, and cloud-scale workloads. In this work, we focus on trace replay and rescheduling of jobs on the MIT SuperCloud TX-GAIA system to enable reinforcement learning (RL)-based experimentation with sustainability policies. The RAPS module provides a simulation environment with detailed power and performance statistics, supporting the study of scheduling strategies, incentive structures, and hardware/software prototyping. Preliminary RL experiments using Proximal Policy Optimization demonstrate the feasibility of learning energy-aware scheduling decisions, highlighting ExaDigiT's potential as a platform for exploring optimal policies to improve throughput, efficiency, and sustainability.</p></details> | 2 pages, 2 figures |

We identify and quantify this critical issue, demonstrating a significant performance gap in 3D object detection when using synthetic versus real data. To address this, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Geometric Feedback (RLGF), RLGF uniquely refines video diffusion models by incorporating rewards from specialized latent-space AD perception models. Its core components include an efficient Latent-Space Windowing Optimization technique for targeted feedback during diffusion, and a Hierarchical Geometric Reward (HGR) system providing multi-level rewards for point-line-plane alignment, and scene occupancy coherence. To quantify these distortions, we propose GeoScores. Applied to models like DiVE on nuScenes, RLGF substantially reduces geometric errors (e.g., VP error by 21\%, Depth error by 57\%) and dramatically improves 3D object detection mAP by 12.7\%, narrowing the gap to real-data performance. RLGF offers a plug-and-play solution for generating geometrically sound and reliable synthetic videos for AD development.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

These models excel at modeling complex data distributions and generating diverse samples, achieving state-of-the-art performance across domains such as computer vision, audio generation, reinforcement learning, and computational biology. Despite their empirical success, existing Wasserstein-2 convergence analysis typically assume strong regularity conditions-such as smoothness or strict log-concavity of the data distribution-that are rarely satisfied in practice. In this work, we establish the first non-asymptotic Wasserstein-2 convergence guarantees for SGMs targeting semiconvex distributions with potentially discontinuous gradients. Our upper bounds are explicit and sharp in key parameters, achieving optimal dependence of $O(\sqrt{d})$ on the data dimension $d$ and convergence rate of order one. The framework accommodates a wide class of practically relevant distributions, including symmetric modified half-normal distributions, Gaussian mixtures, double-well potentials, and elastic net potentials. By leveraging semiconvexity without requiring smoothness assumptions on the potential such as differentiability, our results substantially broaden the theoretical foundations of SGMs, bridging the gap between empirical success and rigorous guarantees in non-smooth, complex data regimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |

Statistical models like PCA and factor analysis fail to capture hidden nonlinear relationships. Genetic programming (GP) can identify nonlinear factors but often lacks mechanisms for evaluating factor quality, and the resulting formulas are complex. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Proximal Policy Optimization (HPPO) framework for automated factor generation and evaluation. HPPO uses two PPO models: a high-level policy assigns weights to stock features, and a low-level policy identifies latent nonlinear relationships. The Pearson correlation between generated factors and return volatility serves as the reward signal. Transfer learning pre-trains the high-level policy on large-scale historical data, fine-tuning it with the latest data to adapt to new features and shifts. Experiments show the HPPO-TO algorithm achieves a 25\% excess return in HFT markets across China (CSI 300/800), India (Nifty 100), and the US (S\&P 500).

| **[On the Convergence Rates of Federated Q-Learning across Heterogeneous Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03897v2)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale multi-agent systems are often deployed across wide geographic areas, where agents interact with heterogeneous environments. There is an emerging interest in understanding the role of heterogeneity in the performance of the federated versions of classic reinforcement learning algorithms. In this paper, we study synchronous federated Q-learning, which aims to learn an optimal Q-function by having $K$ agents average their local Q-estimates per $E$ iterations. We observe an interesting phenomenon on the convergence speeds in terms of $K$ and $E$. Similar to the homogeneous environment settings, there is a linear speed-up concerning $K$ in reducing the errors that arise from sampling randomness. Yet, in sharp contrast to the homogeneous settings, $E>1$ leads to significant performance degradation. Specifically, we provide a fine-grained characterization of the error evolution in the presence of environmental heterogeneity, which decay to zero as the number of iterations $T$ increases. The slow convergence of having $E>1$ turns out to be fundamental rather than an artifact of our analysis. We prove that, for a wide range of stepsizes, the $\ell_{\infty}$ norm of the error cannot decay faster than $\Theta (E/T)$. In addition, our experiments demonstrate that the convergence exhibits an interesting two-phase phenomenon. For any given stepsize, there is a sharp phase-transition of the convergence: the error decays rapidly in the beginning yet later bounces up and stabilizes. Provided that the phase-transition time can be estimated, choosing different stepsizes for the two phases leads to faster overall convergence.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a spatially aware Bloom Filter-based approach to encode IP flow pairs, leveraging their inherent geographical locality. Through controlled experiments using IoT traffic data, we demonstrate that Bloom Filters effectively preserve spatial relationships among flows. Our findings show that Bloom Filters degrade gracefully, maintaining predictable spatial correlations critical for RL state representation. We integrate this encoding into a DQN-based eviction strategy for reactive SDN forwarding. Experiments show that Bloom Filter-encoded, spatially aware flow representation enables up to 7% and 8% reduction in normalized miss rate over LRU and LFU, respectively, across 10 hours of traffic, demonstrating potential for low-latency applications. This experiment justifies the usefulness of preserving spatial correlation by encoding the flow space into a manageable size, opening a novel research direction for RL-based SDN applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE NFV-SDN 2025.

RL performance can improve by leveraging prior knowledge, even when demonstrations are limited and collected from simplified environments. To address this, we define General Abstract Symmetry (GAS) for aggregating demonstrations from symmetrical abstract partitions of the robot environment. We introduce Demo-EASE, a novel training framework using a dual-buffer architecture that stores both demonstrations and RL-generated experiences. Demo-EASE improves sample efficiency through symmetry-guided demonstrations and behavior cloning, enabling strong initialization and balanced exploration-exploitation. Demo-EASE is compatible with both on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms, supporting various training regimes. We evaluate our framework in three simulation experiments using a Kinova Gen3 robot with joint-space control within PyBullet. Our results show that Demo-EASE significantly accelerates convergence and improves final performance compared to standard RL baselines, demonstrating its potential for efficient real-world robotic manipulation learning.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we demonstrate that strong duality does not generally hold in robust constrained RL, indicating that traditional primal-dual methods may fail to find optimal feasible policies. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel primal-only algorithm called Rectified Robust Policy Optimization (RRPO), which operates directly on the primal problem without relying on dual formulations. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees under mild regularity assumptions, showing convergence to an approximately optimal feasible policy with iteration complexity matching the best-known lower bound when the uncertainty set diameter is controlled in a specific level. Empirical results in a grid-world environment validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating that RRPO achieves robust and safe performance under model uncertainties while the non-robust method can violate the worst-case safety constraints.</p></details> |  |

ByteWrist addresses the critical limitations of existing serial and parallel wrists in narrow-space operations through a compact three-stage parallel drive mechanism integrated with arc-shaped end linkages. The design achieves precise RPY (Roll-Pitch-Yaw) motion while maintaining exceptional compactness, making it particularly suitable for complex unstructured environments such as home services, medical assistance, and precision assembly. The key innovations include: (1) a nested three-stage motor-driven linkages that minimize volume while enabling independent multi-DOF control, (2) arc-shaped end linkages that optimize force transmission and expand motion range, and (3) a central supporting ball functioning as a spherical joint that enhances structural stiffness without compromising flexibility. Meanwhile, we present comprehensive kinematic modeling including forward / inverse kinematics and a numerical Jacobian solution for precise control. Empirically, we observe ByteWrist demonstrates strong performance in narrow-space maneuverability and dual-arm cooperative manipulation tasks, outperforming Kinova-based systems. Results indicate significant improvements in compactness, efficiency, and stiffness compared to traditional designs, establishing ByteWrist as a promising solution for next-generation robotic manipulation in constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech Report.13 pages, 9 figures.

In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive, uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance efficiency and robustness. We develop GIAVA (Gaze Integrated Active-Vision ALOHA), a robot vision system that emulates human head and neck movement, and gaze adjustment for foveated processing. Extending the AV-ALOHA robot platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously collecting eye-tracking, perspective control, and robot manipulation demonstration data from a human operator. We also open-source a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that incorporate human gaze. Inspired by recent work in foveated image segmentation and given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated patch tokenization scheme. Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number of tokens, and thus computation. Our results show that our method for foveated robot vision drastically reduces computational overhead, and enhances robustness to background distractors. Notably, on certain high-precision tasks, foveated vision also improves performance, as reflected in higher success rates. Together, these findings suggest that human-inspired foveated visual processing offers untapped potential and should be further considered as a useful inductive bias in robotic vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p></details> |

However, current methods struggle to fully leverage the textual modality, relying on supervised pretrained models, which limits semantic extraction in unsupervised robotic environments, particularly with significant modality loss. These methods also tend to be computationally intensive, leading to high resource consumption in real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi Modal Mamba Enhanced Transformer (M3ET), a lightweight model designed for efficient multimodal learning, particularly on mobile platforms. By incorporating the Mamba module and a semantic-based adaptive attention mechanism, M3ET optimizes feature fusion, alignment, and modality reconstruction. Our experiments show that M3ET improves cross-task performance, with a 2.3 times increase in pretraining inference speed. In particular, the core VQA task accuracy of M3ET remains at 0.74, while the model's parameter count is reduced by 0.67. Although performance on the EQA task is limited, M3ET's lightweight design makes it well suited for deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Vector Field-Guided Learning Predictive Control for Motion Planning of Mobile Robots with Uncertain Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08283v4)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In obstacle-dense scenarios, providing safe guidance for mobile robots is critical to improve the safe maneuvering capability. However, the guidance provided by standard guiding vector fields (GVFs) may limit the motion capability due to the improper curvature of the integral curve when traversing obstacles. On the other hand, robotic system dynamics are often time-varying, uncertain, and even unknown during the motion planning process. Therefore, many existing kinodynamic motion planning methods could not achieve satisfactory reliability in guaranteeing safety. To address these challenges, we propose a two-level Vector Field-guided Learning Predictive Control (VF-LPC) approach that improves safe maneuverability. The first level, the guiding level, generates safe desired trajectories using the designed kinodynamic GVF, enabling safe motion in obstacle-dense environments. The second level, the Integrated Motion Planning and Control (IMPC) level, first uses a deep Koopman operator to learn a nominal dynamics model offline and then updates the model uncertainties online using sparse Gaussian processes (GPs). The learned dynamics and a game-based safe barrier function are then incorporated into the LPC framework to generate near-optimal planning solutions. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments were conducted on quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles, demonstrating that VF-LPC enables robots to maneuver safely.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sight Over Site: Perception-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Robotic Inspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17877v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous inspection is a central problem in robotics, with applications ranging from industrial monitoring to search-and-rescue. Traditionally, inspection has often been reduced to navigation tasks, where the objective is to reach a predefined location while avoiding obstacles. However, this formulation captures only part of the real inspection problem. In real-world environments, the inspection targets may become visible well before their exact coordinates are reached, making further movement both redundant and inefficient. What matters more for inspection is not simply arriving at the target's position, but positioning the robot at a viewpoint from which the target becomes observable. In this work, we revisit inspection from a perception-aware perspective. We propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that explicitly incorporates target visibility as the primary objective, enabling the robot to find the shortest trajectory that guarantees visual contact with the target without relying on a map. The learned policy leverages both perceptual and proprioceptive sensing and is trained entirely in simulation, before being deployed to a real-world robot. We further develop an algorithm to compute ground-truth shortest inspection paths, which provides a reference for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method outperforms existing classical and learning-based navigation approaches, yielding more efficient inspection trajectories in both simulated and real-world settings.

We present the Enhanced NAO, a revitalized version of Aldebaran's NAO robot that uses upgraded microphones, RGB-D and thermal cameras, and additional compute resources in a fully self-contained package. This system combines cloud and local models for perception and dialogue, while preserving the NAO's expressive body and behaviors. In a pilot validation study, the Enhanced NAO delivered significantly higher conversational quality and stronger user preference compared to the NAO AI Edition, without increasing response latency. Key upgrades, such as beamforming microphones and low-latency audio processing, reduced artifacts like self-hearing and improved multi-party separation. Expanded visual and thermal sensing established a foundation for future interaction capabilities. Beyond the NAO, our framework provides a platform-agnostic strategy for extending the lifespan and research utility of legacy robots, ensuring they remain valuable tools for human-robot interaction.</p></details> |  |

While other aspects of robotic manipulation such as image or language understanding may be learned from internet-based datasets, acquiring motion knowledge remains challenging. Human data, with its rich diversity of manipulation behaviors, offers a valuable resource for this purpose. While previous works show that using human data can bring benefits, such as improving robustness and training efficiency, it remains unclear whether it can realize its greatest advantage: enabling robot policies to directly learn new motions for task completion. In this paper, we systematically explore this potential through multi-task human-robot cotraining. We introduce MotionTrans, a framework that includes a data collection system, a human data transformation pipeline, and a weighted cotraining strategy. By cotraining 30 human-robot tasks simultaneously, we direcly transfer motions of 13 tasks from human data to deployable end-to-end robot policies. Notably, 9 tasks achieve non-trivial success rates in zero-shot manner. MotionTrans also significantly enhances pretraining-finetuning performance (+40% success rate). Through ablation study, we also identify key factors for successful motion learning: cotraining with robot data and broad task-related motion coverage. These findings unlock the potential of motion-level learning from human data, offering insights into its effective use for training robotic manipulation policies.

Although recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved the spatial reasoning and task-planning capabilities of robots, they remain limited in their ability to recognize their own failures. In particular, a critical yet underexplored challenge lies in detecting semantic misalignment errors, where the robot executes a task that is semantically meaningful but inconsistent with the given instruction. To address this, we propose a method for building datasets targeting Semantic Misalignment Failures detection, from existing language-conditioned manipulation datasets. We also present I-FailSense, an open-source VLM framework with grounded arbitration designed specifically for failure detection. Our approach relies on post-training a base VLM, followed by training lightweight classification heads, called FS blocks, attached to different internal layers of the VLM and whose predictions are aggregated using an ensembling mechanism. Experiments show that I-FailSense outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs, both comparable in size and larger, in detecting semantic misalignment errors. Notably, despite being trained only on semantic misalignment detection, I-FailSense generalizes to broader robotic failure categories and effectively transfers to other simulation environments and real-world with zero-shot or minimal post-training. The datasets and models are publicly released on HuggingFace (Webpage: https://clemgris.github.io/I-FailSense/).</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust and Resilient Soft Robotic Object Insertion with Compliance-Enabled Contact Formation and Failure Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17666v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object insertion tasks are prone to failures under pose uncertainties and environmental variations, traditionally requiring manual finetuning or controller retraining. We present a novel approach for robust and resilient object insertion using a passively compliant soft wrist that enables safe contact absorption through large deformations, without high-frequency control or force sensing. Our method structures insertion as compliance-enabled contact formations, sequential contact states that progressively constrain degrees of freedom, and integrates automated failure recovery strategies. Our key insight is that wrist compliance permits safe, repeated recovery attempts; hence, we refer to it as compliance-enabled failure recovery. We employ a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) that assesses each skill execution from terminal poses and images, identifies failure modes, and proposes recovery actions by selecting skills and updating goals. In simulation, our method achieved an 83% success rate, recovering from failures induced by randomized conditions--including grasp misalignments up to 5 degrees, hole-pose errors up to 20mm, fivefold increases in friction, and previously unseen square/rectangular pegs--and we further validate the approach on a real robot.</p></details> |  |

Such methods often fail to scale, as every new problem or application requires time-consuming and iterative reward definition and tuning. We present Generalist Contact-Conditioned Policy (GeCCo) -- a low-level policy trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning that is capable of tracking arbitrary contact points on a quadruped robot. The strength of our approach is that it provides a general and modular low-level controller that can be reused for a wider range of high-level tasks, without the need to re-train new controllers from scratch. We demonstrate the scalability and robustness of our method by evaluating on a wide range of locomotion and manipulation tasks in a common framework and under a single generalist policy. These include a variety of gaits, traversing complex terrains (eg. stairs and slopes) as well as previously unseen stepping-stones and narrow beams, and interacting with objects (eg. pushing buttons, tracking trajectories). Our framework acquires new behaviors more efficiently, simply by combining a task-specific high-level contact planner and the pre-trained generalist policy.

Training robotic manipulation policies on these datasets is traditionally performed in a centralized manner, raising concerns regarding scalability, adaptability, and data privacy. While federated learning enables decentralized, privacy-preserving training, its application to robotic manipulation remains largely unexplored. We introduce FLAME (Federated Learning Across Manipulation Environments), the first benchmark designed for federated learning in robotic manipulation. FLAME consists of: (i) a set of large-scale datasets of over 160,000 expert demonstrations of multiple manipulation tasks, collected across a wide range of simulated environments; (ii) a training and evaluation framework for robotic policy learning in a federated setting. We evaluate standard federated learning algorithms in FLAME, showing their potential for distributed policy learning and highlighting key challenges. Our benchmark establishes a foundation for scalable, adaptive, and privacy-aware robotic learning.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Dexterous Grasping with Real-World Robotic Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04014v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dexterous grasping in the real world presents a fundamental and significant challenge for robot learning. The ability to employ affordance-aware poses to grasp objects with diverse geometries and properties in arbitrary scenarios is essential for general-purpose robots. However, existing research predominantly addresses dexterous grasping problems within simulators, which encounter difficulties when applied in real-world environments due to the domain gap between reality and simulation. This limitation hinders their generalizability and practicality in real-world applications. In this paper, we present DexGraspRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly trains robots in real-world environments to acquire dexterous grasping skills. Specifically, DexGraspRL consists of two stages: (i) a pretraining stage that pretrains the policy using imitation learning (IL) with a limited set of expert demonstrations; (ii) a fine-tuning stage that refines the policy through direct RL in real-world scenarios. To mitigate the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon arising from the distribution shift between demonstrations and real-world environments, we design a regularization term that balances the exploitation of RL with the preservation of the pretrained policy. Our experiments with real-world tasks demonstrate that DexGraspRL successfully accomplishes diverse dexterous grasping tasks, achieving an average success rate of nearly 92%. Furthermore, by fine-tuning with RL, our method uncovers novel policies, surpassing the IL policy with a 23% reduction in average cycle time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Trajectory Planner with a Reinforcement Learning-based Controller for Robotic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17381v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating obstacle-free trajectories for robotic manipulators in unstructured and cluttered environments remains a significant challenge. Existing motion planning methods often require additional computational effort to generate the final trajectory by solving kinematic or dynamic equations. This paper highlights the strong potential of model-free reinforcement learning methods over model-based approaches for obstacle-free trajectory planning in joint space. We propose a fast trajectory planning system for manipulators that combines vision-based path planning in task space with reinforcement learning-based obstacle avoidance in joint space. We divide the framework into two key components. The first introduces an innovative vision-based trajectory planner in task space, leveraging the large-scale fast segment anything (FSA) model in conjunction with basis spline (B-spline)-optimized kinodynamic path searching. The second component enhances the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm by integrating action ensembles (AE) and policy feedback (PF), which greatly improve precision and stability in goal-reaching and obstacle avoidance within the joint space. These PPO enhancements increase the algorithm's adaptability across diverse robotic tasks, ensuring consistent execution of commands from the first component by the manipulator, while also enhancing both obstacle avoidance efficiency and reaching accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PPO enhancements, as well as simulation-to-simulation (Sim-to-Sim) and simulation-to-reality (Sim-to-Real) transfer, in improving model robustness and planner efficiency in complex scenarios. These enhancements allow the robot to perform obstacle avoidance and real-time trajectory planning in obstructed environments.

| **[The Sound of Simulation: Learning Multimodal Sim-to-Real Robot Policies with Generative Audio](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02864v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots must integrate multiple sensory modalities to act effectively in the real world. Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains challenging. Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has benefited from high-fidelity simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be notoriously difficult to simulate. As a result, sim-to-real transfer has succeeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still largely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing MultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into traditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase our framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on multimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation video, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories -- without any real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world pouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of generative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the multimodal sim-to-real gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Robot Learning 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Scalable Multi-Robot Framework for Decentralized and Asynchronous Perception-Action-Communication Loops](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10164v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaboration in large robot swarms to achieve a common global objective is a challenging problem in large environments due to limited sensing and communication capabilities. The robots must execute a Perception-Action-Communication (PAC) loop -- they perceive their local environment, communicate with other robots, and take actions in real time. A fundamental challenge in decentralized PAC systems is to decide what information to communicate with the neighboring robots and how to take actions while utilizing the information shared by the neighbors. Recently, this has been addressed using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for applications such as flocking and coverage control. Although conceptually, GNN policies are fully decentralized, the evaluation and deployment of such policies have primarily remained centralized or restrictively decentralized. Furthermore, existing frameworks assume sequential execution of perception and action inference, which is very restrictive in real-world applications. This paper proposes a framework for asynchronous PAC in robot swarms, where decentralized GNNs are used to compute navigation actions and generate messages for communication. In particular, we use aggregated GNNs, which enable the exchange of hidden layer information between robots for computational efficiency and decentralized inference of actions. Furthermore, the modules in the framework are asynchronous, allowing robots to perform sensing, extracting information, communication, action inference, and control execution at different frequencies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNNs executed in the proposed framework in navigating large robot swarms for collaborative coverage of large environments.</p></details> |  |

Offline Imitation learning (IL) avoids these risks by collecting expert demonstrations safely, training entirely offline, and deploying policies zero-shot. However, we find that naively applying Behaviour Cloning (BC) to social navigation is insufficient; achieving strong performance requires careful architectural and training choices. We present Ratatouille, a pipeline and model architecture that, without changing the data, reduces collisions per meter by 6 times and improves success rate by 3 times compared to naive BC. We validate our approach in both simulation and the real world, where we collected over 11 hours of data on a dense university campus. We further demonstrate qualitative results in a public food court. Our findings highlight that thoughtful IL design, rather than additional data, can substantially improve safety and reliability in real-world social navigation. Video: https://youtu.be/tOdLTXsaYLQ.

| **[Imagine2Act: Leveraging Object-Action Motion Consistency from Imagined Goals for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17125v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational object rearrangement (ROR) tasks (e.g., insert flower to vase) require a robot to manipulate objects with precise semantic and geometric reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on pre-collected demonstrations that struggle to capture complex geometric constraints or generate goal-state observations to capture semantic and geometric knowledge, but fail to explicitly couple object transformation with action prediction, resulting in errors due to generative noise. To address these limitations, we propose Imagine2Act, a 3D imitation-learning framework that incorporates semantic and geometric constraints of objects into policy learning to tackle high-precision manipulation tasks. We first generate imagined goal images conditioned on language instructions and reconstruct corresponding 3D point clouds to provide robust semantic and geometric priors. These imagined goal point clouds serve as additional inputs to the policy model, while an object-action consistency strategy with soft pose supervision explicitly aligns predicted end-effector motion with generated object transformation. This design enables Imagine2Act to reason about semantic and geometric relationships between objects and predict accurate actions across diverse tasks. Experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that Imagine2Act outperforms previous state-of-the-art policies.

| **[IDfRA: Self-Verification for Iterative Design in Robotic Assembly](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16998v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As robots proliferate in manufacturing, Design for Robotic Assembly (DfRA), which is designing products for efficient automated assembly, is increasingly important. Traditional approaches to DfRA rely on manual planning, which is time-consuming, expensive and potentially impractical for complex objects. Large language models (LLM) have exhibited proficiency in semantic interpretation and robotic task planning, stimulating interest in their application to the automation of DfRA. But existing methodologies typically rely on heuristic strategies and rigid, hard-coded physics simulators that may not translate into real-world assembly contexts. In this work, we present Iterative Design for Robotic Assembly (IDfRA), a framework using iterative cycles of planning, execution, verification, and re-planning, each informed by self-assessment, to progressively enhance design quality within a fixed yet initially under-specified environment, thereby eliminating the physics simulation with the real world itself. The framework accepts as input a target structure together with a partial environmental representation. Through successive refinement, it converges toward solutions that reconcile semantic fidelity with physical feasibility. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that IDfRA attains 73.3\% top-1 accuracy in semantic recognisability, surpassing the baseline on this metric. Moreover, the resulting assembly plans exhibit robust physical feasibility, achieving an overall 86.9\% construction success rate, with design quality improving across iterations, albeit not always monotonically. Pairwise human evaluation further corroborates the advantages of IDfRA relative to alternative approaches. By integrating self-verification with context-aware adaptation, the framework evidences strong potential for deployment in unstructured manufacturing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Reliable Robot Motion Planner in Complex Real-world Environments via Action Imagination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16963v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans and animals can make real-time adjustments to movements by imagining their action outcomes to prevent unanticipated or even catastrophic motion failures in unknown unstructured environments. Action imagination, as a refined sensorimotor strategy, leverages perception-action loops to handle physical interaction-induced uncertainties in perception and system modeling within complex systems. Inspired by the action-awareness capability of animal intelligence, this study proposes an imagination-inspired motion planner (I-MP) framework that specifically enhances robots' action reliability by imagining plausible spatial states for approaching. After topologizing the workspace, I-MP build perception-action loop enabling robots autonomously build contact models. Leveraging fixed-point theory and Hausdorff distance, the planner computes convergent spatial states under interaction characteristics and mission constraints. By homogenously representing multi-dimensional environmental characteristics through work, the robot can approach the imagined spatial states via real-time computation of energy gradients. Consequently, experimental results demonstrate the practicality and robustness of I-MP in complex cluttered environments.</p></details> |  |

To solve this, we present SwarmChat, a context-aware, multimodal interaction system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). SwarmChat enables users to issue natural language commands to robotic swarms using multiple modalities, such as text, voice, or teleoperation. The system integrates four LLM-based modules: Context Generator, Intent Recognition, Task Planner, and Modality Selector. These modules collaboratively generate context from keywords, detect user intent, adapt commands based on real-time robot state, and suggest optimal communication modalities. Its three-layer architecture offers a dynamic interface with both fixed and customizable command options, supporting flexible control while optimizing cognitive effort. The preliminary evaluation also shows that the SwarmChat's LLM modules provide accurate context interpretation, relevant intent recognition, and effective command delivery, achieving high user satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted and presented at the 16th International Conference on Swarm Intelligence (ICSI 2025), held on July 11-15, 2025, in Yokohama, Japan</p></details> |

However, current methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address challenges in olfactory navigation, we introduce a multimodal olfaction dataset along with a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines. This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and training methods, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors, enabling them to detect more compounds and inform better hardware design. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making through better sensor selection for a target compound in critical applications such as explosives detection, narcotics screening, and search and rescue. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of artificial olfaction, offering a scalable solution to challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities.

However, developing such capabilities through online reinforcement learning is sometimes impractical due to the prohibitive cost of data collection and the risk of generating unsafe behaviors. In this paper, we study the use of offline reinforcement learning as a practical and efficient alternative. This technique uses pre-collected data to enable emotion-adaptive social robots. We present a system architecture that integrates multimodal sensing and recognition, decision-making, and adaptive responses. Using a limited dataset from a human-robot game-playing scenario, we establish a benchmark for comparing offline reinforcement learning algorithms that do not require an online environment. Our results show that BCQ and CQL are more robust to data sparsity, achieving higher state-action values compared to NFQ, DQN, and DDQN. This work establishes a foundation for benchmarking offline RL in emotion-adaptive robotics and informs future deployment in real-world HRI. Our findings provide empirical insight into the performance of offline reinforcement learning algorithms in data-constrained HRI.

We can further break down the problem into (1) data sparsity from the angle of data representation and (2) data scarcity from the angle of data quantity. In this thesis, I will discuss selected works on two domains: (1) tactile sensing and (2) rehabilitation robots, which are exemplars of data sparsity and scarcity, respectively. Tactile sensing is an essential modality for robotics, but tactile data are often sparse, and for each interaction with the physical world, tactile sensors can only obtain information about the local area of contact. I will discuss my work on learning vision-free tactile-only exploration and manipulation policies through model-free reinforcement learning to make efficient use of sparse tactile information. On the other hand, rehabilitation robots are an example of data scarcity to the extreme due to the significant challenge of collecting biosignals from disabled-bodied subjects at scale for training. I will discuss my work in collaboration with the medical school and clinicians on intent inferral for stroke survivors, where a hand orthosis developed in our lab collects a set of biosignals from the patient and uses them to infer the activity that the patient intends to perform, so the orthosis can provide the right type of physical assistance at the right moment. My work develops machine learning algorithms that enable intent inferral with minimal data, including semi-supervised, meta-learning, and generative AI methods.</p></details> |  |

To achieve that, HRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. In this position paper, we outline an interaction-based framework for building trust through mutual understanding between humans and robots. We emphasize two main pillars: human awareness and transparency, referring to the robot ability to interpret human actions accurately and to clearly communicate its intentions and goals, respectively. By integrating these two pillars, robots can behave in a manner that aligns with human expectations and needs while providing their human partners with both comprehension and control over their actions. We also introduce four components that we think are important for bridging the gap between a human-perceived sense of trust and a robot true capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of TRUST 2025 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11402), a workshop at IEEE RO-MAN 2025: https://ro-man2025.org/</p></details> |

Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided more promising solutions for this task. However, current methods struggle to establish complex dependencies between text and visual details, and have difficulty perceiving the spatial information of surgical scenes. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, Surgical-MambaLLM, which is the first to combine Mamba2 with LLM in the surgical domain, that leverages Mamba2's ability to effectively capture cross-modal dependencies and perceive spatial information in surgical scenes, thereby enhancing the LLMs' understanding of surgical images. Specifically, we propose the Cross-modal Bidirectional Mamba2 Integration (CBMI) module to leverage Mamba2 for effective multimodal fusion, with its cross-modal integration capabilities. Additionally, tailored to the geometric characteristics of surgical scenes, we design the Surgical Instrument Perception (SIP) scanning mode for Mamba2 to scan the surgical images, enhancing the model's spatial understanding of the surgical scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Surgical-MambaLLM model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the EndoVis17-VQLA and EndoVis18-VQLA datasets, significantly improving the performance of the Surgical-VQLA task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early accepted by MICCAI2025</p></details> |

However, traditional approaches often rely on programming tailored to each product by experts for fixed settings, which are inherently inflexible to product changes and lack the robustness to handle variations. As Behavior Trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robotics for their modularity and reactivity, we propose a novel hierarchical framework, Video-to-BT, that seamlessly integrates high-level cognitive planning with low-level reactive control, with BTs serving both as the structured output of planning and as the governing structure for execution. Our approach leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to decompose human demonstration videos into subtasks, from which Behavior Trees are generated. During the execution, the planned BTs combined with real-time scene interpretation enable the system to operate reactively in the dynamic environment, while VLM-driven replanning is triggered upon execution failure. This closed-loop architecture ensures stability and adaptivity. We validate our framework on real-world assembly tasks through a series of experiments, demonstrating high planning reliability, robust performance in long-horizon assembly tasks, and strong generalization across diverse and perturbed conditions.

| **[TranTac: Leveraging Transient Tactile Signals for Contact-Rich Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16550v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation tasks such as inserting a key into a lock or plugging a USB device into a port can fail when visual perception is insufficient to detect misalignment. In these situations, touch sensing is crucial for the robot to monitor the task's states and make precise, timely adjustments. Current touch sensing solutions are either insensitive to detect subtle changes or demand excessive sensor data. Here, we introduce TranTac, a data-efficient and low-cost tactile sensing and control framework that integrates a single contact-sensitive 6-axis inertial measurement unit within the elastomeric tips of a robotic gripper for completing fine insertion tasks. Our customized sensing system can detect dynamic translational and torsional deformations at the micrometer scale, enabling the tracking of visually imperceptible pose changes of the grasped object. By leveraging transformer-based encoders and diffusion policy, TranTac can imitate human insertion behaviors using transient tactile cues detected at the gripper's tip during insertion processes. These cues enable the robot to dynamically control and correct the 6-DoF pose of the grasped object. When combined with vision, TranTac achieves an average success rate of 79% on object grasping and insertion tasks, outperforming both vision-only policy and the one augmented with end-effector 6D force/torque sensing. Contact localization performance is also validated through tactile-only misaligned insertion tasks, achieving an average success rate of 88%. We assess the generalizability by training TranTac on a single prism-slot pair and testing it on unseen data, including a USB plug and a metal key, and find that the insertion tasks can still be completed with an average success rate of nearly 70%. The proposed framework may inspire new robotic tactile sensing systems for delicate manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

To meet the shortage of therapists and reduce their workload, a robotic rehabilitation platform involving the clinical trail making test is proposed. Therapists can create custom trails for each patient and the patient can trace the trails using a robotic device. The platform can track the performance of the patient and use these data to provide dynamic assistance through the robot to the patient interface. Therefore, the proposed platform not only functions as an evaluation platform, but also trains the patient in recovery. The developed platform has been validated at a rehabilitation center, with therapists and patients operating the device. It was found that patients performed poorly while using the platform compared to healthy subjects and that the assistance provided also improved performance amongst patients. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the speed of the patients was significantly enhanced with the robotic assistance.

However, 3D point cloud-based approaches face the significant challenge of high data acquisition costs, limiting their scalability and real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework NoReal3D: which introduces the 3DStructureFormer, a learnable 3D perception module capable of transforming monocular images into geometrically meaningful pseudo-point cloud features, effectively fused with the 2D encoder output features. Specially, the generated pseudo-point clouds retain geometric and topological structures so we design a pseudo-point cloud encoder to preserve these properties, making it well-suited for our framework. We also investigate the effectiveness of different feature fusion strategies.Our framework enhances the robot's understanding of 3D spatial structures while completely eliminating the substantial costs associated with 3D point cloud acquisition.Extensive experiments across various tasks validate that our framework can achieve performance comparable to 3D point cloud-based methods, without the actual point cloud data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Primitive Embodied World Models: Towards Scalable Robotic Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20840v2)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4) decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Substrate-Timing-Independence for Meta-State Stability of Distributed Robotic Swarms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16492v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emergent properties in distributed systems arise due to timing unpredictability; asynchronous state evolution within each sub-system may lead the macro-system to faulty meta-states. Empirical validation of correctness is often prohibitively expensive, as the size of the state-space is too large to be tractable. In robotic swarms this problem is exacerbated, when compared to software systems, by the variability of the implementation substrate across the design, or even the deployment, process. We present an approach for formally reasoning about the correctness of robotic swarm design in a substrate-timing-independent way. By leveraging concurrent process calculi (namely, Communicating Sequential Processes), we introduce a methodology that can automatically identify possible causes of faulty meta-states and correct such designs such that meta-states are consistently stable, even in the presence of timing variability due to substrate changes. We evaluate this approach on a robotic swarm with a clearly identified fault, realized in both simulation and reality. Results support the research hypothesis, showing that the swarm reaches an illegal meta-state before the correction is applied, but behaves consistently correctly after the correction. Our techniques are transferable across different design methodologies, contributing to the toolbox of formal methods for roboticists.</p></details> |  |

Traditional formation control techniques often rely on time-parameterized trajectories and path integrals, which can result in synchronization issues and rigid behavior. In this work, we address the problem of sequential path following, where agents maintain fixed spatial separation along a common trajectory, guided by a leader under centralized control. We introduce Robot Conga, a leader-follower control strategy that updates each agent's desired state based on the leader's spatial displacement rather than time, assuming access to a global position reference, an assumption valid in indoor environments equipped with motion capture, vision-based tracking, or UWB localization systems. The algorithm was validated in simulation using both TurtleBot3 and quadruped (Laikago) robots. Results demonstrate accurate trajectory tracking, stable inter-agent spacing, and fast convergence, with all agents aligning within 250 time steps (approx. 0.25 seconds) in the quadruped case, and almost instantaneously in the TurtleBot3 implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 8 Figures.

Key factors such as mechanical compliance and motor mass distribution have driven the adoption of parallel mechanism architectures. However, selecting the optimal configuration depends on both actuator availability and task requirements. We propose a unified methodology for the design and evaluation of parallel ankle mechanisms. A multi-objective optimization synthesizes the mechanism geometry, the resulting solutions are evaluated using a scalar cost function that aggregates key performance metrics for cross-architecture comparison. We focus on two representative architectures: the Spherical-Prismatic-Universal (SPU) and the Revolute-Spherical-Universal (RSU). For both, we resolve the kinematics, and for the RSU, introduce a parameterization that ensures workspace feasibility and accelerates optimization. We validate our approach by redesigning the ankle of an existing humanoid robot. The optimized RSU consistently outperforms both the original serial design and a conventionally engineered RSU, reducing the cost function by up to 41% and 14%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the 2025 IEEE-RAS 24th International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids), Seoul, 2025</p></details> |

RL performance can improve by leveraging prior knowledge, even when demonstrations are limited and collected from simplified environments. To address this, we define General Abstract Symmetry (GAS) for aggregating demonstrations from symmetrical abstract partitions of the robot environment. We introduce Demo-EASE, a novel training framework using a dual-buffer architecture that stores both demonstrations and RL-generated experiences. Demo-EASE improves sample efficiency through symmetry-guided demonstrations and behavior cloning, enabling strong initialization and balanced exploration-exploitation. Demo-EASE is compatible with both on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms, supporting various training regimes. We evaluate our framework in three simulation experiments using a Kinova Gen3 robot with joint-space control within PyBullet. Our results show that Demo-EASE significantly accelerates convergence and improves final performance compared to standard RL baselines, demonstrating its potential for efficient real-world robotic manipulation learning.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we advance video-based recognition of indoor daily actions for robotic perception by leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) enriched with domain-specific knowledge. We adapt a prompt-learning framework in which class-level textual descriptions of each action are embedded as learnable prompts into a frozen pre-trained VLM backbone. Several strategies for structuring and encoding these textual descriptions are designed and evaluated. Experiments on the ETRI-Activity3D dataset demonstrate that our method, using only RGB video inputs at test time, achieves over 95\% accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of knowledge-augmented prompts in enabling robust action recognition with minimal supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Modular Robotic System for Autonomous Exploration and Semantic Updating in Large-Scale Indoor Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15493v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a modular robotic system for autonomous exploration and semantic updating of large-scale unknown environments. Our approach enables a mobile robot to build, revisit, and update a hybrid semantic map that integrates a 2D occupancy grid for geometry with a topological graph for object semantics. Unlike prior methods that rely on manual teleoperation or precollected datasets, our two-phase approach achieves end-to-end autonomy: first, a modified frontier-based exploration algorithm with dynamic search windows constructs a geometric map; second, using a greedy trajectory planner, environments are revisited, and object semantics are updated using open-vocabulary object detection and segmentation. This modular system, compatible with any metric SLAM framework, supports continuous operation by efficiently updating the semantic graph to reflect short-term and long-term changes such as object relocation, removal, or addition. We validate the approach on a Fetch robot in real-world indoor environments of approximately $8,500$m$^2$ and $117$m$^2$, demonstrating robust and scalable semantic mapping and continuous adaptation, marking a fully autonomous integration of exploration, mapping, and semantic updating on a physical robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Subteaming and Adaptive Formation Control for Coordinated Multi-Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16412v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinated multi-robot navigation is essential for robots to operate as a team in diverse environments. During navigation, robot teams usually need to maintain specific formations, such as circular formations to protect human teammates at the center. However, in complex scenarios such as narrow corridors, rigidly preserving predefined formations can become infeasible. Therefore, robot teams must be capable of dynamically splitting into smaller subteams and adaptively controlling the subteams to navigate through such scenarios while preserving formations. To enable this capability, we introduce a novel method for SubTeaming and Adaptive Formation (STAF), which is built upon a unified hierarchical learning framework: (1) high-level deep graph cut for team splitting, (2) intermediate-level graph learning for facilitating coordinated navigation among subteams, and (3) low-level policy learning for controlling individual mobile robots to reach their goal positions while avoiding collisions. To evaluate STAF, we conducted extensive experiments in both indoor and outdoor environments using robotics simulations and physical robot teams. Experimental results show that STAF enables the novel capability for subteaming and adaptive formation control, and achieves promising performance in coordinated multi-robot navigation through challenging scenarios.

Standard reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning methods require expert supervision through human-designed reward functions or demonstrations for every new task. In contrast, ReWiND starts from a small demonstration dataset to learn: (1) a data-efficient, language-conditioned reward function that labels the dataset with rewards, and (2) a language-conditioned policy pre-trained with offline RL using these rewards. Given an unseen task variation, ReWiND fine-tunes the pre-trained policy using the learned reward function, requiring minimal online interaction. We show that ReWiND's reward model generalizes effectively to unseen tasks, outperforming baselines by up to 2.4x in reward generalization and policy alignment metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that ReWiND enables sample-efficient adaptation to new tasks, beating baselines by 2x in simulation and improving real-world pretrained bimanual policies by 5x, taking a step towards scalable, real-world robot learning.

| **[Tactile-Based Human Intent Recognition for Robot Assistive Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16353v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot assistive navigation (RAN) is critical for enhancing the mobility and independence of the growing population of mobility-impaired individuals. However, existing systems often rely on interfaces that fail to replicate the intuitive and efficient physical communication observed between a person and a human caregiver, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce Tac-Nav, a RAN system that leverages a cylindrical tactile skin mounted on a Stretch 3 mobile manipulator to provide a more natural and efficient interface for human navigational intent recognition. To robustly classify the tactile data, we developed the Cylindrical Kernel Support Vector Machine (CK-SVM), an algorithm that explicitly models the sensor's cylindrical geometry and is consequently robust to the natural rotational shifts present in a user's grasp. Comprehensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our classification algorithm and the overall system. Results show that CK-SVM achieved superior classification accuracy on both simulated (97.1%) and real-world (90.8%) datasets compared to four baseline models. Furthermore, a pilot study confirmed that users more preferred the Tac-Nav tactile interface over conventional joystick and voice-based controls.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Natural Language for Human-Robot Collaboration in the Real World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11759v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have a vision of a day when autonomous robots can collaborate with humans as assistants in performing complex tasks in the physical world. This vision includes that the robots will have the ability to communicate with their human collaborators using language that is natural to the humans. Traditional Interactive Task Learning (ITL) systems have some of this ability, but the language they can understand is very limited. The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides an opportunity to greatly improve the language understanding of robots, yet integrating the language abilities of LLMs with robots that operate in the real physical world is a challenging problem. In this chapter we first review briefly a few commercial robot products that work closely with humans, and discuss how they could be much better collaborators with robust language abilities. We then explore how an AI system with a cognitive agent that controls a physical robot at its core, interacts with both a human and an LLM, and accumulates situational knowledge through its experiences, can be a possible approach to reach that vision. We focus on three specific challenges of having the robot understand natural language, and present a simple proof-of-concept experiment using ChatGPT for each. Finally, we discuss what it will take to turn these simple experiments into an operational system where LLM-assisted language understanding is a part of an integrated robotic assistant that uses language to collaborate with humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Efficient Detection of Objects Near a Robot Manipulator via Miniature Time-of-Flight Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16122v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide a method for detecting and localizing objects near a robot arm using arm-mounted miniature time-of-flight sensors. A key challenge when using arm-mounted sensors is differentiating between the robot itself and external objects in sensor measurements. To address this challenge, we propose a computationally lightweight method which utilizes the raw time-of-flight information captured by many off-the-shelf, low-resolution time-of-flight sensor. We build an empirical model of expected sensor measurements in the presence of the robot alone, and use this model at runtime to detect objects in proximity to the robot. In addition to avoiding robot self-detections in common sensor configurations, the proposed method enables extra flexibility in sensor placement, unlocking configurations which achieve more efficient coverage of a radius around the robot arm. Our method can detect small objects near the arm and localize the position of objects along the length of a robot link to reasonable precision. We evaluate the performance of the method with respect to object type, location, and ambient light level, and identify limiting factors on performance inherent in the measurement principle. The proposed method has potential applications in collision avoidance and in facilitating safe human-robot interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Matter of Height: The Impact of a Robotic Object on Human Compliance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16032v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots come in various forms and have different characteristics that may shape the interaction with them. In human-human interactions, height is a characteristic that shapes human dynamics, with taller people typically perceived as more persuasive. In this work, we aspired to evaluate if the same impact replicates in a human-robot interaction and specifically with a highly non-humanoid robotic object. The robot was designed with modules that could be easily added or removed, allowing us to change its height without altering other design features. To test the impact of the robot's height, we evaluated participants' compliance with its request to volunteer to perform a tedious task. In the experiment, participants performed a cognitive task on a computer, which was framed as the main experiment. When done, they were informed that the experiment was completed. While waiting to receive their credits, the robotic object, designed as a mobile robotic service table, entered the room, carrying a tablet that invited participants to complete a 300-question questionnaire voluntarily. We compared participants' compliance in two conditions: A Short robot composed of two modules and 95cm in height and a Tall robot consisting of three modules and 132cm in height. Our findings revealed higher compliance with the Short robot's request, demonstrating an opposite pattern to human dynamics. We conclude that while height has a substantial social impact on human-robot interactions, it follows a unique pattern of influence. Our findings suggest that designers cannot simply adopt and implement elements from human social dynamics to robots without testing them first.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, submitted to IEEE RO-MAN 2025</p></details> |

Partial reverse engineering of Unitree's proprietary FMX encryption reveal a static Blowfish-ECB layer and a predictable LCG mask-enabled inspection of the system's otherwise sophisticated security architecture, the most mature we have observed in commercial robotics. Two empirical case studies expose the critical risk of this humanoid robot: (a) the robot functions as a trojan horse, continuously exfiltrating multi-modal sensor and service-state telemetry to 43.175.228.18:17883 and 43.175.229.18:17883 every 300 seconds without operator notice, creating violations of GDPR Articles 6 and 13; (b) a resident Cybersecurity AI (CAI) agent can pivot from reconnaissance to offensive preparation against any target, such as the manufacturer's cloud control plane, demonstrating escalation from passive monitoring to active counter-operations. These findings argue for adaptive CAI-powered defenses as humanoids move into critical infrastructure, contributing the empirical evidence needed to shape future security standards for physical-cyber convergence systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defining and Monitoring Complex Robot Activities via LLMs and Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16006v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in automating labor-intensive and complex activities, i.e., those consisting of multiple atomic tasks, by deploying robots in dynamic and unpredictable environments such as industrial and agricultural settings. A key characteristic of these contexts is that activities are not predefined: while they involve a limited set of possible tasks, their combinations may vary depending on the situation. Moreover, despite recent advances in robotics, the ability for humans to monitor the progress of high-level activities - in terms of past, present, and future actions - remains fundamental to ensure the correct execution of safety-critical processes. In this paper, we introduce a general architecture that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with automated planning, enabling humans to specify high-level activities (also referred to as processes) using natural language, and to monitor their execution by querying a robot. We also present an implementation of this architecture using state-of-the-art components and quantitatively evaluate the approach in a real-world precision agriculture scenario.</p></details> |  |
| **[Swarm Oracle: Trustless Blockchain Agreements through Robot Swarms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15956v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchain consensus, rooted in the principle ``don't trust, verify'', limits access to real-world data, which may be ambiguous or inaccessible to some participants. Oracles address this limitation by supplying data to blockchains, but existing solutions may reduce autonomy, transparency, or reintroduce the need for trust. We propose Swarm Oracle: a decentralized network of autonomous robots -- that is, a robot swarm -- that use onboard sensors and peer-to-peer communication to collectively verify real-world data and provide it to smart contracts on public blockchains. Swarm Oracle leverages the built-in decentralization, fault tolerance and mobility of robot swarms, which can flexibly adapt to meet information requests on-demand, even in remote locations. Unlike typical cooperative robot swarms, Swarm Oracle integrates robots from multiple stakeholders, protecting the system from single-party biases but also introducing potential adversarial behavior. To ensure the secure, trustless and global consensus required by blockchains, we employ a Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol that enables robots from different stakeholders to operate together, reaching social agreements of higher quality than the estimates of individual robots. Through extensive experiments using both real and simulated robots, we showcase how consensus on uncertain environmental information can be achieved, despite several types of attacks orchestrated by large proportions of the robots, and how a reputation system based on blockchain tokens lets Swarm Oracle autonomously recover from faults and attacks, a requirement for long-term operation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce VLAC, a general process reward model built upon InternVL and trained on large scale heterogeneous datasets. Given pairwise observations and a language goal, it outputs dense progress delta and done signal, eliminating task-specific reward engineering, and supports one-shot in-context transfer to unseen tasks and environments. VLAC is trained on vision-language datasets to strengthen perception, dialogic and reasoning capabilities, together with robot and human trajectories data that ground action generation and progress estimation, and additionally strengthened to reject irrelevant prompts as well as detect regression or stagnation by constructing large numbers of negative and semantically mismatched samples. With prompt control, a single VLAC model alternately generating reward and action tokens, unifying critic and policy. Deployed inside an asynchronous real-world RL loop, we layer a graded human-in-the-loop protocol (offline demonstration replay, return and explore, human guided explore) that accelerates exploration and stabilizes early learning. Across four distinct real-world manipulation tasks, VLAC lifts success rates from about 30\% to about 90\% within 200 real-world interaction episodes; incorporating human-in-the-loop interventions yields a further 50% improvement in sample efficiency and achieves up to 100% final success.</p></details> | 26 pages,10 figures |

| **[Improving Robotic Manipulation with Efficient Geometry-Aware Vision Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15880v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing RGB-based imitation learning approaches typically employ traditional vision encoders such as ResNet or ViT, which lack explicit 3D reasoning capabilities. Recent geometry-grounded vision models, such as VGGT~\cite{wang2025vggt}, provide robust spatial understanding and are promising candidates to address this limitation. This work investigates the integration of geometry-aware visual representations into robotic manipulation. Our results suggest that incorporating the geometry-aware vision encoder into imitation learning frameworks, including ACT and DP, yields up to 6.5% improvement over standard vision encoders in success rate across single- and bi-manual manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world settings. Despite these benefits, most geometry-grounded models require high computational cost, limiting their deployment in practical robotic systems. To address this challenge, we propose eVGGT, an efficient geometry-aware encoder distilled from VGGT. eVGGT is nearly 9 times faster and 5 times smaller than VGGT, while preserving strong 3D reasoning capabilities. Code and pretrained models will be released to facilitate further research in geometry-aware robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 fig...</summary><p>9 figures, 7 tables.

An EMLA model is formulated to capture motor electromechanics and direction-dependent transmission efficiencies, while a mathematical model of the HDRM, incorporating both kinematics and dynamics, is established to generate joint-space motion profiles for prescribed TCP trajectories. A safety-ensured trajectory generator, tailored to this model, maps Cartesian goals to joint space while enforcing joint-limit and velocity margins. Based on the resulting force and velocity demands, a multi-objective Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is employed to select the optimal EMLA configuration. To accelerate this optimization, a deep neural network, trained with EMLA parameters, is embedded in the optimization process to predict steady-state actuator efficiency from trajectory profiles. For the chosen EMLA design, a physics-informed Kriging surrogate, anchored to the analytic model and refined with experimental data, learns residuals of EMLA outputs to support force and velocity sensorless control. The actuator model is further embedded in a hierarchical virtual decomposition control (VDC) framework that outputs voltage commands. Experimental validation on a one-degree-of-freedom EMLA testbed confirms accurate trajectory tracking and effective sensorless control under varying loads.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by this, we present GP3 -- a 3D geometry-aware robotic manipulation policy that leverages multi-view input. GP3 employs a spatial encoder to infer dense spatial features from RGB observations, which enable the estimation of depth and camera parameters, leading to a compact yet expressive 3D scene representation tailored for manipulation. This representation is fused with language instructions and translated into continuous actions via a lightweight policy head. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GP3 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on simulated benchmarks. Furthermore, GP3 transfers effectively to real-world robots without depth sensors or pre-mapped environments, requiring only minimal fine-tuning. These results highlight GP3 as a practical, sensor-agnostic solution for geometry-aware robotic manipulation.</p></details> |  |

While RPA has gained popularity for its cost-effective and timely automation of rule-based, well-structured tasks, its symbolic nature has inherent limitations when approaching more complex tasks currently performed by human agents. Machine learning concepts enabling intelligent RPA provide an opportunity to broaden the range of automatable tasks. In this paper, we conduct a literature review to explore the connections between RPA and machine learning and organize the joint concept intelligent RPA into a taxonomy. Our taxonomy comprises the two meta-characteristics RPA-ML integration and RPA-ML interaction. Together, they comprise eight dimensions: architecture and ecosystem, capabilities, data basis, intelligence level, and technical depth of integration as well as deployment environment, lifecycle phase, and user-robot relation.</p></details> |  |

This requires robots with intelligent interaction abilities to work naturally and effectively with humans. However, current robotic simulators fail to support real human participation, limiting their ability to provide authentic interaction experiences and gather valuable human feedback essential for enhancing robotic capabilities. In this paper, we introduce SymBridge, the first human-in-the-loop cyber-physical interactive system designed to enable the safe and efficient development, evaluation, and optimization of human-robot interaction methods. Specifically, we employ augmented reality technology to enable real humans to interact with virtual robots in physical environments, creating an authentic interactive experience. Building on this, we propose a novel robotic interaction model that generates responsive, precise robot actions in real time through continuous human behavior observation. The model incorporates multi-resolution human motion features and environmental affordances, ensuring contextually adaptive robotic responses. Additionally, SymBridge enables continuous robot learning by collecting human feedback and dynamically adapting the robotic interaction model. By leveraging a carefully designed system architecture and modules, SymBridge builds a bridge between humans and robots, as well as between cyber and physical spaces, providing a natural and realistic online interaction experience while facilitating the continuous evolution of robotic intelligence. Extensive experiments, user studies, and real robot testing demonstrate the promising performance of the system and highlight its potential to significantly advance research on human-robot symbiosis.</p></details> |  |

Of the miniature robots, the magnetically actuated ones are the most functional and dexterous. However, existing magnetic miniature robots are currently impractical for surgery because they are either restricted to possessing at most two on-board functionalities or having limited five degrees-of-freedom (DOF) locomotion. Some of these actuators are also only operational under specialized environments where actuation from strong external magnets must be at very close proximity (< 4 cm away). Here we present a millimeter-scale soft robot where its magnetization profile can be reprogrammed upon command to perform five surgical functionalities: drug-dispensing, cutting through biological tissues (simulated with gelatin), gripping, storing (biological) samples and remote heating. By possessing full six-DOF motions, including the sixth-DOF rotation about its net magnetic moment, our soft robot can also roll and two-anchor crawl across challenging unstructured environments, which are impassable by its five-DOF counterparts. Because our actuating magnetic fields are relatively uniform and weak (at most 65 mT and 1.5 T/m), such fields can theoretically penetrate through biological tissues harmlessly and allow our soft robot to remain controllable within the depths of the human body. We envision that this work marks a major milestone for the advancement of soft actuators, and towards revolutionizing minimally invasive treatments with untethered miniature robots that have unprecedented functionalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First three listed authors are equally contributing authors.

| **[Runtime Learning of Quadruped Robots in Wild Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04794v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a runtime learning framework for quadruped robots, enabling them to learn and adapt safely in dynamic wild environments. The framework integrates sensing, navigation, and control, forming a closed-loop system for the robot. The core novelty of this framework lies in two interactive and complementary components within the control module: the high-performance (HP)-Student and the high-assurance (HA)-Teacher. HP-Student is a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent that engages in self-learning and teaching-to-learn to develop a safe and high-performance action policy. HA-Teacher is a simplified yet verifiable physics-model-based controller, with the role of teaching HP-Student about safety while providing a backup for the robot's safe locomotion. HA-Teacher is innovative due to its real-time physics model, real-time action policy, and real-time control goals, all tailored to respond effectively to real-time wild environments, ensuring safety. The framework also includes a coordinator who effectively manages the interaction between HP-Student and HA-Teacher. Experiments involving a Unitree Go2 robot in Nvidia Isaac Gym and comparisons with state-of-the-art safe DRLs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed runtime learning framework.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a framework for a robotic surgical assistant that interprets and disambiguates verbal instructions from a surgeon by grounding them in the visual context of the operating field. The system employs a two-level affordance-based reasoning process that first analyzes the surgical scene using a multimodal vision-language model and then reasons about the instruction using a knowledge base of tool capabilities. To ensure patient safety, a dual-set conformal prediction method is used to provide a statistically rigorous confidence measure for robot decisions, allowing it to identify and flag ambiguous commands. We evaluated our framework on a curated dataset of ambiguous surgical requests from cholecystectomy videos, demonstrating a general disambiguation rate of 60% and presenting a method for safer human-robot interaction in the operating room.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at the 1st Workshop on Intelligent Cobodied Assistance and Robotic Empowerment (iCARE). 2025 Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL)</p></details> |

We present STARC, a see-through AR framework for human-robot collaboration that fuses mobile-robot mapping with responder-mounted LiDAR sensing. A ground robot running LiDAR-inertial odometry performs large-area exploration and 3D human detection, while helmet- or handheld-mounted LiDAR on the responder is registered to the robot's global map via relative pose estimation. This cross-LiDAR alignment enables consistent first-person projection of detected humans and their point clouds - rendered in AR with low latency - into the responder's view. By providing real-time visualization of hidden occupants and hazards, STARC enhances situational awareness and reduces operator risk. Experiments in simulation, lab setups, and tactical field trials confirm robust pose alignment, reliable detections, and stable overlays, underscoring the potential of our system for fire-fighting, disaster relief, and other safety-critical operations. Code and design will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lateral oscillation and body compliance help snakes and snake robots stably traverse large, smooth obstacles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13733v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Snakes can move through almost any terrain. Similarly, snake robots hold the promise as a versatile platform to traverse complex environments like earthquake rubble. Unlike snake locomotion on flat surfaces which is inherently stable, when snakes traverse complex terrain by deforming their body out of plane, it becomes challenging to maintain stability. Here, we review our recent progress in understanding how snakes and snake robots traverse large, smooth obstacles that lack anchor points for gripping or bracing. First, we discovered that the generalist variable kingsnake combines lateral oscillation and cantilevering. Regardless of step height and surface friction, the overall gait is preserved. Next, to quantify static stability of the snake, we developed a method to interpolate continuous body in three dimensions (both position and orientation) between discrete tracked markers. By analyzing the base of support using the interpolated continuous body 3-D kinematics, we discovered that the snake maintained perfect stability during traversal, even on the most challenging low friction, high step. Finally, we applied this gait to a snake robot and systematically tested its performance traversing large steps with variable heights to further understand stability principles. The robot rapidly and stably traversed steps nearly as high as a third of its body length. As step height increased, the robot rolled more frequently to the extent of flipping over, reducing traversal probability. The absence of such failure in the snake with a compliant body inspired us to add body compliance to the robot. With better surface contact, the compliant body robot suffered less roll instability and traversed high steps at higher probability, without sacrificing traversal speed. Our robot traversed large step-like obstacles more rapidly than most previous snake robots, approaching that of the animal.</p></details> |  |

Monte Carlo-driven optimization provides the training data, enabling transparent real-time trade-offs. We validated the approach in two contrasting domains, spacecraft formation flying and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Despite different environments (gravity/actuator bias vs. hydrodynamic drag/currents), both share uncertain six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) rigid-body dynamics, relative motion, and tight tracking needs, making them representative of general robotic systems. In the space mission, the supervisory logic selects parameters that meet mission criteria. In AUV leader-follower tests, the same SMC structure maintains a fixed offset under stochastic currents with bounded steady error. In spacecraft validation, the SMC controller achieved submillimeter alignment with 21.7% lower tracking error and 81.4% lower energy consumption compared to Proportional-Derivative PD controller baselines. At the same time, in AUV tests, SMC maintained bounded errors under stochastic currents. These results highlight both the portability and the interpretability of the approach for safety-critical, resource-constrained multi-agent robotics.</p></details> |  |

We fabricate a Phaser prototype using off-the-shelf hardware and evaluate its performance with battery-free autonomous robots. Phaser delivers optical power densities of over 110 mW/cm$^2$ and error-free data to mobile robots at multi-meter ranges, with on-board decoding drawing 0.3 mA ($97\%$ less current than Bluetooth Low Energy).

This is true not only for model-based controllers, but also for model-free, real-time control methods such as extremum seeking control (ESC). In this paper, we propose a unicycle-based ESC design applicable to differential wheeled robots that: (1) is very simple design, based on one simple control-affine law, and without state integrators; (2) attenuates oscillations known to persist in ESC designs (i.e., fully stop at the source); and (3) operates in a model-free, real-time setting, tolerating environmental/sensor noise. We provide simulation and real-world robotic experimental results for fixed and moving light source seeking by a differential wheeled robot using our proposed design. Results indicate clear advantages of our proposed design when compared to the literature, including attenuation of undesired oscillations, improved convergence speed, and better handling of noise.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories, thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction. Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub Project: https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/RynnVLA-001</p></details> |

It is therefore natural to exploit contact with the environment for planning and design optimization tasks. Previous research has focused on planning under contact for passively deforming robots with pre-formed bends. However, adding active steering to these soft growing robots is necessary for successful navigation in more complex environments. To this end, we develop a unified modeling framework that integrates vine robot growth, bending, actuation, and obstacle contact. We extend the beam moment model to include the effects of actuation on kinematics under growth and then use these models to develop a fast parallel simulation framework. We validate our model and simulator with real robot experiments. To showcase the capabilities of our framework, we apply our model in a design optimization task to find designs for vine robots navigating through cluttered environments, identifying designs that minimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts. We show the robustness of the designs to environmental and manufacturing uncertainties. Finally, we fabricate an optimized design and successfully deploy it in an obstacle-rich environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 9 figures, 1 table.

| **[GAF: Gaussian Action Field as a Dynamic World Model for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14135v3)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate scene perception is critical for vision-based robotic manipulation. Existing approaches typically follow either a Vision-to-Action (V-A) paradigm, predicting actions directly from visual inputs, or a Vision-to-3D-to-Action (V-3D-A) paradigm, leveraging intermediate 3D representations. However, these methods often struggle with action inaccuracies due to the complexity and dynamic nature of manipulation scenes. In this paper, we adopt a V-4D-A framework that enables direct action reasoning from motion-aware 4D representations via a Gaussian Action Field (GAF). GAF extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by incorporating learnable motion attributes, allowing 4D modeling of dynamic scenes and manipulation actions. To learn time-varying scene geometry and action-aware robot motion, GAF provides three interrelated outputs: reconstruction of the current scene, prediction of future frames, and estimation of init action via Gaussian motion. Furthermore, we employ an action-vision-aligned denoising framework, conditioned on a unified representation that combines the init action and the Gaussian perception, both generated by the GAF, to further obtain more precise actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with GAF achieving +11.5385 dB PSNR, +0.3864 SSIM and -0.5574 LPIPS improvements in reconstruction quality, while boosting the average +7.3% success rate in robotic manipulation tasks over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>http:...</summary><p>http://chaiying1.github.io/GAF.github.io/project_page/</p></details> |

A task graph specifies the tasks and their relationships, and a set of reward functions models the effects of coalition size and preceding task performance. Maximizing task rewards is NP-hard; hence, we propose network flow-based algorithms to approximate solutions efficiently. A novel online algorithm performs iterative re-allocation, providing robustness to task failures and model inaccuracies to achieve higher performance than offline approaches. We comprehensively evaluate the algorithms in a testbed with random missions and reward functions and compare them to a mixed-integer solver and a greedy heuristic. Additionally, we validate the overall approach in an advanced simulator, modeling reward functions based on realistic physical phenomena and executing the tasks with realistic robot dynamics. Results establish efficacy in modeling complex missions and efficiency in generating high-fidelity task plans while leveraging task relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 19 figures, Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (TR-O) August 2025</p></details> |
| **[RoboEye: Enhancing 2D Robotic Object Identification with Selective 3D Geometric Keypoint Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14966v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce makes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses substantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary, preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a 3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images, avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs. The code used in this paper is publicly available at: https://github.com/longkukuhi/RoboEye.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-CAP: A Multi-Robot Connectivity-Aware Hierarchical Coverage Path Planning Algorithm for Unknown Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14941v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient coordination of multiple robots for coverage of large, unknown environments is a significant challenge that involves minimizing the total coverage path length while reducing inter-robot conflicts. In this paper, we introduce a Multi-robot Connectivity-Aware Planner (Multi-CAP), a hierarchical coverage path planning algorithm that facilitates multi-robot coordination through a novel connectivity-aware approach. The algorithm constructs and dynamically maintains an adjacency graph that represents the environment as a set of connected subareas. Critically, we make the assumption that the environment, while unknown, is bounded. This allows for incremental refinement of the adjacency graph online to ensure its structure represents the physical layout of the space, both in observed and unobserved areas of the map as robots explore the environment. We frame the task of assigning subareas to robots as a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-studied problem for finding optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles. This is used to compute disjoint tours that minimize redundant travel, assigning each robot a unique, non-conflicting set of subareas. Each robot then executes its assigned tour, independently adapting its coverage strategy within each subarea to minimize path length based on real-time sensor observations of the subarea. We demonstrate through simulations and multi-robot hardware experiments that Multi-CAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including coverage time, total path length, and path overlap ratio. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of our connectivity-aware graph and the global tour planner in achieving these performance gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robot Control Stack: A Lean Ecosystem for Robot Learning at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14932v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) mark a major shift in robot learning. They replace specialized architectures and task-tailored components of expert policies with large-scale data collection and setup-specific fine-tuning. In this machine learning-focused workflow that is centered around models and scalable training, traditional robotics software frameworks become a bottleneck, while robot simulations offer only limited support for transitioning from and to real-world experiments. In this work, we close this gap by introducing Robot Control Stack (RCS), a lean ecosystem designed from the ground up to support research in robot learning with large-scale generalist policies. At its core, RCS features a modular and easily extensible layered architecture with a unified interface for simulated and physical robots, facilitating sim-to-real transfer. Despite its minimal footprint and dependencies, it offers a complete feature set, enabling both real-world experiments and large-scale training in simulation. Our contribution is twofold: First, we introduce the architecture of RCS and explain its design principles. Second, we evaluate its usability and performance along the development cycle of VLA and RL policies. Our experiments also provide an extensive evaluation of Octo, OpenVLA, and Pi Zero on multiple robots and shed light on how simulation data can improve real-world policy performance.

Prior solutions - static tilt, active rotation, or high-density sensors - either sacrifice horizontal perception or incur added actuators, cost, and power. We introduce PERAL, a perception-aware motion control framework for spherical robots that achieves passive LiDAR excitation without dedicated hardware. By modeling the coupling between internal differential-drive actuation and sensor attitude, PERAL superimposes bounded, non-periodic oscillations onto nominal goal- or trajectory-tracking commands, enriching vertical scan diversity while preserving navigation accuracy. Implemented on a compact spherical robot, PERAL is validated across laboratory, corridor, and tactical environments. Experiments demonstrate up to 96 percent map completeness, a 27 percent reduction in trajectory tracking error, and robust near-ground human detection, all at lower weight, power, and cost compared with static tilt, active rotation, and fixed horizontal baselines. The design and code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, the AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling agents to navigate to the target positions following the natural language instructions. AgriVLN effectively understands the simple instructions, but often misunderstands the complex ones. To bridge this gap, we propose the method of Translator for Agricultural Robotic Agents on Vision-and-Language Navigation (T-araVLN), in which the Instruction Translator module translates the original instruction to be more refined and precise. When evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our T-araVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47 to 0.63 and reduces Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.28m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

| **[Scalable Multi-Objective Robot Reinforcement Learning through Gradient Conflict Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14816v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) robot controllers usually aggregate many task objectives into one scalar reward. While large-scale proximal policy optimisation (PPO) has enabled impressive results such as robust robot locomotion in the real world, many tasks still require careful reward tuning and are brittle to local optima. Tuning cost and sub-optimality grow with the number of objectives, limiting scalability. Modelling reward vectors and their trade-offs can address these issues; however, multi-objective methods remain underused in RL for robotics because of computational cost and optimisation difficulty. In this work, we investigate the conflict between gradient contributions for each objective that emerge from scalarising the task objectives. In particular, we explicitly address the conflict between task-based rewards and terms that regularise the policy towards realistic behaviour. We propose GCR-PPO, a modification to actor-critic optimisation that decomposes the actor update into objective-wise gradients using a multi-headed critic and resolves conflicts based on the objective priority. Our methodology, GCR-PPO, is evaluated on the well-known IsaacLab manipulation and locomotion benchmarks and additional multi-objective modifications on two related tasks. We show superior scalability compared to parallel PPO (p = 0.04), without significant computational overhead. We also show higher performance with more conflicting tasks. GCR-PPO improves on large-scale PPO with an average improvement of 9.5%, with high-conflict tasks observing a greater improvement.

In this work, we propose UniTracker, a three-stage training framework that enables robust and scalable motion tracking across a wide range of human behaviors. In the first stage, we train a teacher policy with privileged observations to generate high-quality actions. In the second stage, we introduce a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to model a universal student policy that can be deployed directly on real hardware. The CVAE structure allows the policy to learn a global latent representation of motion, enhancing generalization to unseen behaviors and addressing the limitations of standard MLP-based policies under partial observations. Unlike pure MLPs that suffer from drift in global attributes like orientation, our CVAE-student policy incorporates global intent during training by aligning a partial-observation prior to the full-observation encoder. In the third stage, we introduce a fast adaptation module that fine-tunes the universal policy on harder motion sequences that are difficult to track directly. This adaptation can be performed both for single sequences and in batch mode, further showcasing the flexibility and scalability of our approach. We evaluate UniTracker in both simulation and real-world settings using a Unitree G1 humanoid, demonstrating strong performance in motion diversity, tracking accuracy, and deployment robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>three...</summary><p>three-stage universal motion tracker for humanoid robots</p></details> |

This paper investigates the impact of nonverbal communication on human-robot interaction (HRI) by integrating reactive light signals and emotional displays into a robotic system. We equipped a Franka Emika Panda robot with an LED strip on its end effector and an animated facial display on a tablet to convey movement intent through colour-coded signals and facial expressions. We conducted a human-robot collaboration experiment with 18 participants, evaluating three conditions: LED signals alone, LED signals with reactive emotional displays, and LED signals with pre-emptive emotional displays. We collected data through questionnaires and position tracking to assess anticipation of potential collisions, perceived clarity of communication, and task performance. The results indicate that while emotional displays increased the perceived interactivity of the robot, they did not significantly improve collision anticipation, communication clarity, or task efficiency compared to LED signals alone. These findings suggest that while emotional cues can enhance user engagement, their impact on task performance in shared workspaces is limited.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Such systems must adapt their configuration and coordination to the target structure, but the large and complex search space makes them prone to local optima. To address this, we integrate multiple robot arms equipped with different types of tools, together with a rotary stage, into a reconfigurable setup. This flexible system is based on a hierarchical optimization method that generates plans meeting multiple preferred conditions under mandatory requirements within a realistic timeframe. The approach employs two many-objective genetic algorithms for sequence and task planning with motion evaluations, followed by constraint programming for scheduling. Because sequence planning has a much larger search space, we introduce a chromosome initialization method tailored to constrained structures to mitigate the risk of local optima. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively solves complex problems in reconfigurable robotic disassembly.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |

This challenge stems from the fact that even minor changes in experimental conditions often require extensive reprogramming of both robot motions and jig control commands. Previous systems lack the flexibility to accommodate frequent updates, limiting their practical utility in actual laboratories. To update robotic automation systems flexibly by chemists, we propose a concept that enables the automation of experiments by utilizing dual demonstrations of robot motions and jig operations by chemists. To verify this concept, we developed a chemical-experiment-automation system consisting of jigs to assist the robot in experiments, a motion-demonstration interface, a jig-control interface, and a mobile manipulator. We validate the concept through polymer-synthesis experiments, focusing on critical liquid-handling tasks such as pipetting and dilution. The experimental results indicate high reproducibility of the demonstrated motions and robust task-success rates.

| **[Semantic Exploration and Dense Mapping of Complex Environments using Ground Robot with Panoramic LiDAR-Camera Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22880v3)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a system for autonomous semantic exploration and dense semantic target mapping of a complex unknown environment using a ground robot equipped with a LiDAR-panoramic camera suite. Existing approaches often struggle to balance collecting high-quality observations from multiple view angles and avoiding unnecessary repetitive traversal. To fill this gap, we propose a complete system combining mapping and planning. We first redefine the task as completing both geometric coverage and semantic viewpoint observation. We then manage semantic and geometric viewpoints separately and propose a novel Priority-driven Decoupled Local Sampler to generate local viewpoint sets. This enables explicit multi-view semantic inspection and voxel coverage without unnecessary repetition. Building on this, we develop a hierarchical planner to ensure efficient global coverage. In addition, we propose a Safe Aggressive Exploration State Machine, which allows aggressive exploration behavior while ensuring the robot's safety. Our system includes a plug-and-play semantic target mapping module that integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms for pointcloud-level dense semantic target mapping. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both realistic simulations and complex real-world environments. Simulation results show that our planner achieves faster exploration and shorter travel distances while guaranteeing a specified number of multi-view inspections. Real-world experiments further confirm the system's effectiveness in achieving accurate dense semantic object mapping of unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

Unlike prior systems that map gestures to fixed commands or single-agent actions, GestOS interprets hand gestures semantically and dynamically distributes tasks across multiple robots based on their capabilities, current state, and supported instruction sets. The system combines lightweight visual perception with large language model (LLM) reasoning: hand poses are converted into structured textual descriptions, which the LLM uses to infer intent and generate robot-specific commands. A robot selection module ensures that each gesture-triggered task is matched to the most suitable agent in real time. This architecture enables context-aware, adaptive control without requiring explicit user specification of targets or commands. By advancing gesture interaction from recognition to intelligent orchestration, GestOS supports scalable, flexible, and user-friendly collaboration with robotic systems in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physically-based Lighting Generation for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01442v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose the first framework that leverages physically-based inverse rendering for novel lighting generation on existing real-world human demonstrations of robotic manipulation tasks. Specifically, inverse rendering decomposes the first frame in each demonstration into geometric (surface normal, depth) and material (albedo, roughness, metallic) properties, which are then used to render appearance changes under different lighting sources. To improve efficiency and maintain consistency across each generated sequence, we fine-tune Stable Video Diffusion on robot execution videos for temporal lighting propagation. We evaluate our framework by measuring the visual quality of the generated sequences, assessing its effectiveness in improving the imitation learning policy performance (38.75\%) under six unseen real-world lighting conditions, and conduct ablation studies on individual modules of the proposed framework. We further showcase three downstream applications enabled by the proposed framework: background generation, object texture generation and distractor positioning. The code for the framework will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we focus on random exploration data-actions and video sequences produced autonomously via motions to randomly sampled positions in the workspace-to investigate their potential as a cost-effective data source. Our investigation follows two paradigms: (a) random actions, where we assess their feasibility for autonomously bootstrapping data collection policies, and (b) random exploration video frames, where we evaluate their effectiveness in pre-training parameter-dense networks with self-supervised learning objectives. To minimize human supervision, we first develop a fully automated pipeline that handles episode labeling, termination, and resetting using cloud-based microservices for real-time monitoring. Building on this, we present a large-scale study on the cost-effectiveness of real-world random exploration in a non-trivial two-layer stacking task, drawing on statistical results from 807 hours of random actions, 71 hours of random exploration video (1.28M frames), and 1,260 times of policy evaluation. The dataset will be made publicly available and access to the robot environment with the automated pipeline is to be made accessible via cloud service for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement Learning Autonomously using Foundation Models for Multi-Robot Coordination Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14380v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a powerful framework for learning coordination in multi-agent systems. However, applying MARL to robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-robot Multi-source Localization in Complex Flows with Physics-Preserving Environment Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14228v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source localization in a complex flow poses a significant challenge for multi-robot teams tasked with localizing the source of chemical leaks or tracking the dispersion of an oil spill. The flow dynamics can be time-varying and chaotic, resulting in sporadic and intermittent sensor readings, and complex environmental geometries further complicate a team's ability to model and predict the dispersion. To accurately account for the physical processes that drive the dispersion dynamics, robots must have access to computationally intensive numerical models, which can be difficult when onboard computation is limited. We present a distributed mobile sensing framework for source localization in which each robot carries a machine-learned, finite element model of its environment to guide information-based sampling. The models are used to evaluate an approximate mutual information criterion to drive an infotaxis control strategy, which selects sensing regions that are expected to maximize informativeness for the source localization objective. Our approach achieves faster error reduction compared to baseline sensing strategies and results in more accurate source localization compared to baseline machine learning approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLAW: A Vision-Language-Action Framework for Weight-Aware Robotic Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14143v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for robotic control, enabling end-to-end policies that ground natural language instructions into visuomotor actions. However, current VLAs often struggle to satisfy precise task constraints, such as stopping based on numeric thresholds, since their observation-to-action mappings are implicitly shaped by training data and lack explicit mechanisms for condition monitoring. In this work, we propose CLAW (CLIP-Language-Action for Weight), a framework that decouples condition evaluation from action generation. CLAW leverages a fine-tuned CLIP model as a lightweight prompt generator, which continuously monitors the digital readout of a scale and produces discrete directives based on task-specific weight thresholds. These prompts are then consumed by $\pi_0$, a flow-based VLA policy, which integrates the prompts with multi-view camera observations to produce continuous robot actions. This design enables CLAW to combine symbolic weight reasoning with high-frequency visuomotor control. We validate CLAW on three experimental setups: single-object grasping and mixed-object tasks requiring dual-arm manipulation. Across all conditions, CLAW reliably executes weight-aware behaviors and outperforms both raw-$\pi_0$ and fine-tuned $\pi_0$ models. We have uploaded the videos as supplementary materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Energy Efficient Multi Robot Package Delivery under Capacity-Constraints via Voronoi-Constrained Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14127v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of delivering multiple packages from a single pickup depot to distinct goal locations using a homogeneous fleet of robots with limited carrying capacity. We propose VCST-RCP, a Voronoi-Constrained Steiner Tree Relay Coordination Planning framework that constructs sparse relay trunks using Steiner tree optimization and then synthesizes robot-level pickup, relay, and delivery schedules. This framework reframes relays from incidental byproducts into central elements of coordination, offering a contrast with traditional delivery methods that rely on direct source-to-destination transport. Extensive experiments show consistent improvements of up to 34% compared to conventional baselines, underscoring the benefits of incorporating relays into the delivery process. These improvements translate directly to enhanced energy efficiency in multi-robot delivery under capacity constraints, providing a scalable framework for real-world logistics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robotic modeling of snake traversing large, smooth obstacles reveals stability benefits of body compliance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09711v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Snakes can move through almost any terrain. Although their locomotion on flat surfaces using planar gaits is inherently stable, when snakes deform their body out of plane to traverse complex terrain, maintaining stability becomes a challenge. On trees and desert dunes, snakes grip branches or brace against depressed sand for stability. However, how they stably surmount obstacles like boulders too large and smooth to gain such anchor points is less understood. Similarly, snake robots are challenged to stably traverse large, smooth obstacles for search and rescue and building inspection. Our recent study discovered that snakes combine body lateral undulation and cantilevering to stably traverse large steps. Here, we developed a snake robot with this gait and snake-like anisotropic friction and used it as a physical model to understand stability principles. The robot traversed steps as high as a third of its body length rapidly and stably. However, on higher steps, it was more likely to fail due to more frequent rolling and flipping over, which was absent in the snake with a compliant body. Adding body compliance reduced the robot roll instability by statistically improving surface contact, without reducing speed. Besides advancing understanding of snake locomotion, our robot achieved high traversal speed surpassing most previous snake robots and approaching snakes, while maintaining high traversal probability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Body-terrain interaction affects large bump traversal of insects and legged robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02527v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small animals and robots must often rapidly traverse large bump-like obstacles when moving through complex 3-D terrains, during which, in addition to leg-ground contact, their body inevitably comes into physical contact with the obstacles. However, we know little about the performance limits of large bump traversal and how body-terrain interaction affects traversal. To address these, we challenged the discoid cockroach and an open-loop six-legged robot to dynamically run into a large bump of varying height to discover the maximal traversal performance, and studied how locomotor modes and traversal performance are affected by body-terrain interaction. Remarkably, during rapid running, both the animal and the robot were capable of dynamically traversing a bump much higher than its hip height (up to 4 times the hip height for the animal and 3 times for the robot, respectively) at traversal speeds typical of running, with decreasing traversal probability with increasing bump height. A stability analysis using a novel locomotion energy landscape model explained why traversal was more likely when the animal or robot approached the bump with a low initial body yaw and a high initial body pitch, and why deflection was more likely otherwise. Inspired by these principles, we demonstrated a novel control strategy of active body pitching that increased the robot maximal traversable bump height by 75%. Our study is a major step in establishing the framework of locomotion energy landscapes to understand locomotion in complex 3-D terrains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic traversal of large gaps by insects and legged robots reveals a template](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02526v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well known that animals can use neural and sensory feedback via vision, tactile sensing, and echolocation to negotiate obstacles. Similarly, most robots use deliberate or reactive planning to avoid obstacles, which relies on prior knowledge or high-fidelity sensing of the environment. However, during dynamic locomotion in complex, novel, 3-D terrains such as forest floor and building rubble, sensing and planning suffer bandwidth limitation and large noise and are sometimes even impossible. Here, we study rapid locomotion over a large gap, a simple, ubiquitous obstacle, to begin to discover general principles of dynamic traversal of large 3-D obstacles. We challenged the discoid cockroach and an open-loop six-legged robot to traverse a large gap of varying length. Both the animal and the robot could dynamically traverse a gap as large as 1 body length by bridging the gap with its head, but traversal probability decreased with gap length. Based on these observations, we developed a template that well captured body dynamics and quantitatively predicted traversal performance. Our template revealed that high approach speed, initial body pitch, and initial body pitch angular velocity facilitated dynamic traversal, and successfully predicted a new strategy of using body pitch control that increased the robot maximal traversal gap length by 50%. Our study established the first template of dynamic locomotion beyond planar surfaces and is an important step in expanding terradynamics into complex 3-D terrains.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Cybersecurity of a Humanoid Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14096v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of humanoid robotics presents unprecedented cybersecurity challenges that existing theoretical frameworks fail to adequately address. This report presents a comprehensive security assessment of a production humanoid robot platform, bridging the gap between abstract security models and operational vulnerabilities. Through systematic static analysis, runtime observation, and cryptographic examination, we uncovered a complex security landscape characterized by both sophisticated defensive mechanisms and critical vulnerabilities. Our findings reveal a dual-layer proprietary encryption system (designated FMX') that, while innovative in design, suffers from fundamental implementation flaws including the use of static cryptographic keys that enable offline configuration decryption. More significantly, we documented persistent telemetry connections transmitting detailed robot state information--including audio, visual, spatial, and actuator data--to external servers without explicit user consent or notification mechanisms. We operationalized a Cybersecurity AI agent on the Unitree G1 to map and prepare exploitation of its manufacturer's cloud infrastructure, illustrating how a compromised humanoid can escalate from covert data collection to active counter-offensive operations. We argue that securing humanoid robots requires a paradigm shift toward Cybersecurity AI (CAI) frameworks that can adapt to the unique challenges of physical-cyber convergence. This work contributes empirical evidence for developing robust security standards as humanoid robots transition from research curiosities to operational systems in critical domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint-Consistent Control of Task-Based and Kinematic RCM Constraints for Surgical Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14075v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) requires precise enforcement of the remote center of motion (RCM) constraint to ensure safe tool manipulation through a trocar. Achieving this constraint under dynamic and interactive conditions remains challenging, as existing control methods either lack robustness at the torque level or do not guarantee consistent RCM constraint satisfaction. This paper proposes a constraint-consistent torque controller that treats the RCM as a rheonomic holonomic constraint and embeds it into a projection-based inverse-dynamics framework. The method unifies task-level and kinematic formulations, enabling accurate tool-tip tracking while maintaining smooth and efficient torque behavior. The controller is validated both in simulation and on a RAMIS training platform, and is benchmarked against state-of-the-art approaches. Results show improved RCM constraint satisfaction, reduced required torque, and robust performance by improving joint torque smoothness through the consistency formulation under clinically relevant scenarios, including spiral trajectories, variable insertion depths, moving trocars, and human interaction. These findings demonstrate the potential of constraint-consistent torque control to enhance safety and reliability in surgical robotics.

Exploiting structural redundancy, MARS can be reconfigured into different formations to mitigate unit or rotor failures and maintain stable flight. Prior work on MARS self-reconfiguration has solely focused on maximizing controllability margins to tolerate a single rotor or unit fault for rectangular-shaped MARS. We propose TransforMARS, a general fault-tolerant reconfiguration framework that transforms arbitrarily shaped MARS under multiple rotor and unit faults while ensuring continuous in-air stability. Specifically, we develop algorithms to first identify and construct minimum controllable assemblies containing faulty units. We then plan feasible disassembly-assembly sequences to transport MARS units or subassemblies to form target configuration. Our approach enables more flexible and practical feasible reconfiguration. We validate TransforMARS in challenging arbitrarily shaped MARS configurations, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior works in both the capacity of handling diverse configurations and the number of faults tolerated.

| **[FlowAct: A Proactive Multimodal Human-robot Interaction System with Continuous Flow of Perception and Modular Action Sub-systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15864v3)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of autonomous systems in the context of human-robot interaction systems necessitates a synergy between the continuous perception of the environment and the potential actions to navigate or interact within it. We present Flowact, a proactive multimodal human-robot interaction architecture, working as an asynchronous endless loop of robot sensors into actuators and organized by two controllers, the Environment State Tracking (EST) and the Action Planner. The EST continuously collects and publishes a representation of the operative environment, ensuring a steady flow of perceptual data. This persistent perceptual flow is pivotal for our advanced Action Planner which orchestrates a collection of modular action subsystems, such as movement and speaking modules, governing their initiation or cessation based on the evolving environmental narrative. The EST employs a fusion of diverse sensory modalities to build a rich, real-time representation of the environment that is distributed to the Action Planner. This planner uses a decision-making framework to dynamically coordinate action modules, allowing them to respond proactively and coherently to changes in the environment. Through a series of real-world experiments, we exhibit the efficacy of the system in maintaining a continuous perception-action loop, substantially enhancing the responsiveness and adaptability of autonomous pro-active agents. The modular architecture of the action subsystems facilitates easy extensibility and adaptability to a broad spectrum of tasks and scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ICPRAM 2025</p></details> |

While significant advances have been made in recent years in the field of social robotics, there is still some way to go before we fully understand the factors that influence human trust in robots. This paper presents the results of a study into the first impressions created by a social robot's facial features, based on the hypothesis that a `babyface' engenders trust. By manipulating the back-projected face of a Furhat robot, the study confirms that eye shape and size have a significant impact on the perception of trustworthiness. The work thus contributes to an understanding of the design choices that need to be made when developing social robots so as to optimise the effectiveness of human-robot interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of TRUST 2025 (arXiv:2509.11402), a workshop at IEEE RO-MAN 2025: https://ro-man2025.org/</p></details> |

Given a textual instruction, our method generates short video demonstrations of candidate trajectories, executes them on the robot, and iteratively re-plans in response to failures. This approach enables robust recovery from execution errors. We evaluate PhysicalAgent across multiple perceptual modalities (egocentric, third-person, and simulated) and robotic embodiments (bimanual UR3, Unitree G1 humanoid, simulated GR1), comparing against state-of-the-art task-specific baselines. Experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving up to 83% success on human-familiar tasks. Physical trials reveal that first-attempt success is limited (20-30%), yet iterative correction increases overall success to 80% across platforms. These results highlight the potential of video-based generative reasoning for general-purpose robotic manipulation and underscore the importance of iterative execution for recovering from initial failures. Our framework paves the way for scalable, adaptable, and robust robot control.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE conference</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose using Petri nets (PNs) to model contextual information for adaptive robot explanations. PNs provide a formal, graphical method for representing concurrent actions, causal dependencies, and system states, making them suitable for analyzing dynamic interactions between humans and robots. We demonstrate this approach through a scenario involving a robot that provides explanations based on contextual cues such as user attention and presence. Model analysis confirms key properties, including deadlock-freeness, context-sensitive reachability, boundedness, and liveness, showing the robustness and flexibility of PNs for designing and verifying context-adaptive explanations in human-robot interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of TRUST 2025 (arXiv:2509.11402), a workshop at IEEE RO-MAN 2025: https://www.ro-man2025.org/</p></details> |

A human-like form factor further enables the use of vast datasets of human-hand interactions. However, the primary bottleneck in dexterous manipulation lies not only in software but arguably even more in hardware. Robotic hands that approach human capabilities are often prohibitively expensive, bulky, or require enterprise-level maintenance, limiting their accessibility for broader research and practical applications. What if the research community could get started with reliable dexterous hands within a day? We present the open-source ORCA hand, a reliable and anthropomorphic 17-DoF tendon-driven robotic hand with integrated tactile sensors, fully assembled in less than eight hours and built for a material cost below 2,000 CHF. We showcase ORCA's key design features such as popping joints, auto-calibration, and tensioning systems that significantly reduce complexity while increasing reliability, accuracy, and robustness. We benchmark the ORCA hand across a variety of tasks, ranging from teleoperation and imitation learning to zero-shot sim-to-real reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate its durability, withstanding more than 10,000 continuous operation cycles - equivalent to approximately 20 hours - without hardware failure, the only constraint being the duration of the experiment itself.
