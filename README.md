| **[Constrained Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05863v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable framework for critic-free policy learning, extending it to settings with explicit behavioral constraints remains underexplored. We introduce Constrained GRPO, a Lagrangian-based extension of GRPO for constrained policy optimization. Constraints are specified via indicator cost functions, enabling direct optimization of violation rates through a Lagrangian relaxation. We show that a naive multi-component treatment in advantage estimation can break constrained learning: mismatched component-wise standard deviations distort the relative importance of the different objective terms, which in turn corrupts the Lagrangian signal and prevents meaningful constraint enforcement. We formally derive this effect to motivate our scalarized advantage construction that preserves the intended trade-off between reward and constraint terms. Experiments in a toy gridworld confirm the predicted optimization pathology and demonstrate that scalarizing advantages restores stable constraint control. In addition, we evaluate Constrained GRPO on robotics tasks, where it improves constraint satisfaction while increasing task success, establishing a simple and effective recipe for constrained policy optimization in embodied AI domains that increasingly rely on large multimodal foundation models.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Self-evolving Embodied AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04411v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system formed by agents and their environment through active perception, embodied cognition, and action interaction. Existing embodied AI remains confined to human-crafted setting, in which agents are trained on given memory and construct models for given tasks, enabling fixed embodiments to interact with relatively static environments. Such methods fail in in-the-wild setting characterized by variable embodiments and dynamic open environments. This paper introduces self-evolving embodied AI, a new paradigm in which agents operate based on their changing state and environment with memory self-updating, task self-switching, environment self-prediction, embodiment self-adaptation, and model self-evolution, aiming to achieve continually adaptive intelligence with autonomous evolution. Specifically, we present the definition, framework, components, and mechanisms of self-evolving embodied AI, systematically review state-of-the-art works for realized components, discuss practical applications, and point out future research directions. We believe that self-evolving embodied AI enables agents to autonomously learn and interact with environments in a human-like manner and provide a new perspective toward general artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Vision-Language-Action Models for Embodied AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14093v7)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI is widely recognized as a cornerstone of artificial general intelligence because it involves controlling embodied agents to perform tasks in the physical world. Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. The recent proliferation of VLAs necessitates a comprehensive survey to capture the rapidly evolving landscape. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing VLA-based control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges facing VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. A curated repository associated with this survey is available at: https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA</p></details> |
| **[Structured Self-Consistency:A Multi-Task Evaluation of LLMs on VirtualHome](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00611v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI requires agents to understand goals, plan actions, and execute tasks in simulated environments. We present a comprehensive evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on the VirtualHome benchmark using the Embodied Agent Interface (EAI) framework. We compare two representative 7B-parameter models OPENPANGU-7B and QWEN2.5-7B across four fundamental tasks: Goal Interpretation, Action Sequencing, Subgoal Decomposition, and Transition Modeling. We propose Structured Self-Consistency (SSC), an enhanced decoding strategy that leverages multiple sampling with domain-specific voting mechanisms to improve output quality for structured generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SSC significantly enhances performance, with OPENPANGU-7B excelling at hierarchical planning while QWEN2.5-7B show advantages in action-level tasks. Our analysis reveals complementary strengths across model types, providing insights for future embodied AI system development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hand3R: Online 4D Hand-Scene Reconstruction in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03200v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For Embodied AI, jointly reconstructing dynamic hands and the dense scene context is crucial for understanding physical interaction. However, most existing methods recover isolated hands in local coordinates, overlooking the surrounding 3D environment. To address this, we present Hand3R, the first online framework for joint 4D hand-scene reconstruction from monocular video. Hand3R synergizes a pre-trained hand expert with a 4D scene foundation model via a scene-aware visual prompting mechanism. By injecting high-fidelity hand priors into a persistent scene memory, our approach enables simultaneous reconstruction of accurate hand meshes and dense metric-scale scene geometry in a single forward pass. Experiments demonstrate that Hand3R bypasses the reliance on offline optimization and delivers competitive performance in both local hand reconstruction and global positioning.</p></details> |  |
| **[What does really matter in image goal navigation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01667v3)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image goal navigation requires two different skills: firstly, core navigation skills, including the detection of free space and obstacles, and taking decisions based on an internal representation; and secondly, computing directional information by comparing visual observations to the goal image. Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose estimation from reward for navigation alone. In this large experimental study we investigate the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking, space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings, leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extent. We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Considerate Embodied AI: Co-Designing Situated Multi-Site Healthcare Robots from Abstract Concepts to High-Fidelity Prototypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03054v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Co-design is essential for grounding embodied artificial intelligence (AI) systems in real-world contexts, especially high-stakes domains such as healthcare. While prior work has explored multidisciplinary collaboration, iterative prototyping, and support for non-technical participants, few have interwoven these into a sustained co-design process. Such efforts often target one context and low-fidelity stages, limiting the generalizability of findings and obscuring how participants' ideas evolve. To address these limitations, we conducted a 14-week workshop with a multidisciplinary team of 22 participants, centered around how embodied AI can reduce non-value-added task burdens in three healthcare settings: emergency departments, long-term rehabilitation facilities, and sleep disorder clinics. We found that the iterative progression from abstract brainstorming to high-fidelity prototypes, supported by educational scaffolds, enabled participants to understand real-world trade-offs and generate more deployable solutions. We propose eight guidelines for co-designing more considerate embodied AI: attuned to context, responsive to social dynamics, mindful of expectations, and grounded in deployment.

| **[Real-World Applications of AI in LTE and 5G-NR Network Infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02787v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Telecommunications networks generate extensive performance and environmental telemetry, yet most LTE and 5G-NR deployments still rely on static, manually engineered configurations. This limits adaptability in rural, nomadic, and bandwidth-constrained environments where traffic distributions, propagation characteristics, and user behavior fluctuate rapidly. Artificial Intelligence (AI), more specifically Machine Learning (ML) models, provide new opportunities to transition Radio Access Networks (RANs) from rigid, rule-based systems toward adaptive, self-optimizing infrastructures that can respond autonomously to these dynamics. This paper proposes a practical architecture incorporating AI-assisted planning, reinforcement-learning-based RAN optimization, real-time telemetry analytics, and digital-twin-based validation. In parallel, the paper addresses the challenge of delivering embodied-AI healthcare services, educational tools, and large language model (LLM) applications to communities with insufficient backhaul for cloud computing. We introduce an edge-hosted execution model in which applications run directly on LTE/5G-NR base stations using containers, reducing latency and bandwidth consumption while improving resilience. Together, these contributions demonstrate how AI can enhance network performance, reduce operational overhead, and expand access to advanced digital services, aligning with broader goals of sustainable and inclusive network development.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages and 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[RF-MatID: Dataset and Benchmark for Radio Frequency Material Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20377v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate material identification plays a crucial role in embodied AI systems, enabling a wide range of applications. However, current vision-based solutions are limited by the inherent constraints of optical sensors, while radio-frequency (RF) approaches, which can reveal intrinsic material properties, have received growing attention. Despite this progress, RF-based material identification remains hindered by the lack of large-scale public datasets and the limited benchmarking of learning-based approaches. In this work, we present RF-MatID, the first open-source, large-scale, wide-band, and geometry-diverse RF dataset for fine-grained material identification. RF-MatID includes 16 fine-grained categories grouped into 5 superclasses, spanning a broad frequency range from 4 to 43.5 GHz, and comprises 142k samples in both frequency- and time-domain representations. The dataset systematically incorporates controlled geometry perturbations, including variations in incidence angle and stand-off distance. We further establish a multi-setting, multi-protocol benchmark by evaluating state-of-the-art deep learning models, assessing both in-distribution performance and out-of-distribution robustness under cross-angle and cross-distance shifts. The 5 frequency-allocation protocols enable systematic frequency- and region-level analysis, thereby facilitating real-world deployment. RF-MatID aims to enable reproducible research, accelerate algorithmic advancement, foster cross-domain robustness, and support the development of real-world application in RF-based material identification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[TransNormal: Dense Visual Semantics for Diffusion-based Transparent Object Normal Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00839v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular normal estimation for transparent objects is critical for laboratory automation, yet it remains challenging due to complex light refraction and reflection. These optical properties often lead to catastrophic failures in conventional depth and normal sensors, hindering the deployment of embodied AI in scientific environments. We propose TransNormal, a novel framework that adapts pre-trained diffusion priors for single-step normal regression. To handle the lack of texture in transparent surfaces, TransNormal integrates dense visual semantics from DINOv3 via a cross-attention mechanism, providing strong geometric cues. Furthermore, we employ a multi-task learning objective and wavelet-based regularization to ensure the preservation of fine-grained structural details. To support this task, we introduce TransNormal-Synthetic, a physics-based dataset with high-fidelity normal maps for transparent labware. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransNormal significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods: on the ClearGrasp benchmark, it reduces mean error by 24.4% and improves 11.25° accuracy by 22.8%; on ClearPose, it achieves a 15.2% reduction in mean error. The code and dataset will be made publicly available at https://longxiang-ai.github.io/TransNormal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://longxiang-ai.github.io/TransNormal</p></details> |
| **[APEX: A Decoupled Memory-based Explorer for Asynchronous Aerial Object Goal Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00551v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial Object Goal Navigation, a challenging frontier in Embodied AI, requires an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) agent to autonomously explore, reason, and identify a specific target using only visual perception and language description. However, existing methods struggle with the memorization of complex spatial representations in aerial environments, reliable and interpretable action decision-making, and inefficient exploration and information gathering. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{APEX} (Aerial Parallel Explorer), a novel hierarchical agent designed for efficient exploration and target acquisition in complex aerial settings. APEX is built upon a modular, three-part architecture: 1) Dynamic Spatio-Semantic Mapping Memory, which leverages the zero-shot capability of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to dynamically construct high-resolution 3D Attraction, Exploration, and Obstacle maps, serving as an interpretable memory mechanism. 2) Action Decision Module, trained with reinforcement learning, which translates this rich spatial understanding into a fine-grained and robust control policy. 3) Target Grounding Module, which employs an open-vocabulary detector to achieve definitive and generalizable target identification. All these components are integrated into a hierarchical, asynchronous, and parallel framework, effectively bypassing the VLM's inference latency and boosting the agent's proactivity in exploration. Extensive experiments show that APEX outperforms the previous state of the art by +4.2\% SR and +2.8\% SPL on challenging UAV-ON benchmarks, demonstrating its superior efficiency and the effectiveness of its hierarchical asynchronous design. Our source code is provided in \href{https://github.com/4amGodvzx/apex}{GitHub}</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Inject Once Survive Later: Backdooring Vision-Language-Action Models to Persist Through Downstream Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00500v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become foundational to modern embodied AI systems. By integrating visual perception, language understanding, and action planning, they enable general-purpose task execution across diverse environments. Despite their importance, the security of VLA models remains underexplored -- particularly in the context of backdoor attacks, which pose realistic threats in physical-world deployments. While recent methods attempt to inject backdoors into VLA models, these backdoors are easily erased during downstream adaptation, as user-side fine-tuning with clean data significantly alters model parameters, rendering them impractical for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we propose INFUSE (INjection into Fine-tUne-inSensitive modulEs), the first backdoor attack framework for VLA base models that remains effective even with arbitrary user fine-tuning. INFUSE begins by analyzing parameter sensitivity across diverse fine-tuning scenarios to identify modules that remain largely unchanged -- the fine-tune-insensitive modules. It then injects backdoors into these stable modules while freezing the rest, ensuring malicious behavior persists after extensive user fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VLA architectures demonstrate INFUSE's effectiveness. After user-side fine-tuning, INFUSE maintains mean attack success rates of 91.0% on simulation environments and 79.8% on real-world robot tasks, substantially surpassing BadVLA (38.8% and 36.6%, respectively), while preserving clean-task performance comparable to standard models. These results uncover a critical threat: backdoors implanted before distribution can persist through fine-tuning and remain effective at deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[SRL Proxemics: Spatial Guidelines for Supernumerary Robotic Limbs in Near-Body Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00494v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wearable supernumerary robotic limbs (SRLs) sit at the intersection of human augmentation and embodied AI, transforming into extensions of the human body. However, their movements within the intimate near-body space raise unresolved challenges for perceived safety, user control, and trust. In this paper, we present results from a Wizard-of-Oz study (n=18), where participants completed near-body collaboration tasks with SRLs to explore these challenges. We collected qualitative data through think-aloud protocols and semi-structured interviews, complemented by physiological signals and post-task ratings. Findings indicate that greater autonomy did not inherently enhance perceived safety or trust. Instead, participants identified near-body zones and paired them with clear coordination rules. They also expressed expectations for how different arm components should behave, shaping preferences around autonomy, perceived safety, and trust. Building on these insights, we introduce SRL Proxemics, a zone- and segment-level design framework showing that autonomy is not monolithic: perceived safety hinges on spatially calibrated, legible behaviors, not higher autonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CHI 2026.

| **[TimeBlind: A Spatio-Temporal Compositionality Benchmark for Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00288v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding is essential for video reasoning and embodied AI. Yet, while Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) master static semantics, their grasp of temporal dynamics remains brittle. We present TimeBlind, a diagnostic benchmark for compositional spatio-temporal understanding. Inspired by cognitive science, TimeBlind categorizes fine-grained temporal understanding into three levels: recognizing atomic events, characterizing event properties, and reasoning about event interdependencies. Unlike benchmarks that conflate recognition with temporal reasoning, TimeBlind leverages a minimal-pairs paradigm: video pairs share identical static visual content but differ solely in temporal structure, utilizing complementary questions to neutralize language priors. Evaluating over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro) on 600 curated instances (2400 video-question pairs), reveals that the Instance Accuracy (correctly distinguishing both videos in a pair) of the best performing MLLM is only 48.2%, far below the human performance (98.2%). These results demonstrate that even frontier models rely heavily on static visual shortcuts rather than genuine temporal logic, positioning TimeBlind as a vital diagnostic tool for next-generation video understanding. Dataset and code are available at https://baiqi-li.github.io/timeblind_project/ .</p></details> | <details><summary>For c...</summary><p>For code and data, see https://baiqi-li.github.io/timeblind_project/</p></details> |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Functional 3D Human-Scene Interaction Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20835v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating 3D humans that functionally interact with 3D scenes remains an open problem with applications in embodied AI, robotics, and interactive content creation. The key challenge involves reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses required to achieve functionality-aware interaction. Unfortunately, existing methods typically lack explicit reasoning over object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, resulting in implausible or functionally incorrect interactions. In this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven framework that enables functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. Given a task prompt, FunHSI performs functionality-aware contact reasoning to identify functional scene elements, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and model high-level interactions via a contact graph. We then leverage vision-language models to synthesize a human performing the task in the image and estimate proposed 3D body and hand poses. Finally, the proposed 3D body configuration is refined via stage-wise optimization to ensure physical plausibility and functional correctness. In contrast to existing methods, FunHSI not only synthesizes more plausible general 3D interactions, such as "sitting on a sofa'', while supporting fine-grained functional human-scene interactions, e.g., "increasing the room temperature''. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FunHSI consistently generates functionally correct and physically plausible human-scene interactions across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[EAG-PT: Emission-Aware Gaussians and Path Tracing for Indoor Scene Reconstruction and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23065v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent reconstruction methods based on radiance field such as NeRF and 3DGS reproduce indoor scenes with high visual fidelity, but break down under scene editing due to baked illumination and the lack of explicit light transport. In contrast, physically based inverse rendering relies on mesh representations and path tracing, which enforce correct light transport but place strong requirements on geometric fidelity, becoming a practical bottleneck for real indoor scenes. In this work, we propose Emission-Aware Gaussians and Path Tracing (EAG-PT), aiming for physically based light transport with a unified 2D Gaussian representation. Our design is based on three cores: (1) using 2D Gaussians as a unified scene representation and transport-friendly geometry proxy that avoids reconstructed mesh, (2) explicitly separating emissive and non-emissive components during reconstruction for further scene editing, and (3) decoupling reconstruction from final rendering by using efficient single-bounce optimization and high-quality multi-bounce path tracing after scene editing. Experiments on synthetic and real indoor scenes show that EAG-PT produces more natural and physically consistent renders after editing than radiant scene reconstructions, while preserving finer geometric detail and avoiding mesh-induced artifacts compared to mesh-based inverse path tracing. These results suggest promising directions for future use in interior design, XR content creation, and embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://eag-pt.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Alignment among Language, Vision and Action Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22948v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental question in cognitive science and AI concerns whether different learning modalities: language, vision, and action, give rise to distinct or shared internal representations. Traditional views assume that models trained on different data types develop specialized, non-transferable representations. However, recent evidence suggests unexpected convergence: models optimized for distinct tasks may develop similar representational geometries. We investigate whether this convergence extends to embodied action learning by training a transformer-based agent to execute goal-directed behaviors in response to natural language instructions. Using behavioral cloning on the BabyAI platform, we generated action-grounded language embeddings shaped exclusively by sensorimotor control requirements. We then compared these representations with those extracted from state-of-the-art large language models (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, BERT) and vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP). Despite substantial differences in training data, modality, and objectives, we observed robust cross-modal alignment. Action representations aligned strongly with decoder-only language models and BLIP (precision@15: 0.70-0.73), approaching the alignment observed among language models themselves. Alignment with CLIP and BERT was significantly weaker. These findings indicate that linguistic, visual, and action representations converge toward partially shared semantic structures, supporting modality-independent semantic organization and highlighting potential for cross-domain transfer in embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[PLANING: A Loosely Coupled Triangle-Gaussian Framework for Streaming 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22046v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Streaming reconstruction from monocular image sequences remains challenging, as existing methods typically favor either high-quality rendering or accurate geometry, but rarely both. We present PLANING, an efficient on-the-fly reconstruction framework built on a hybrid representation that loosely couples explicit geometric primitives with neural Gaussians, enabling geometry and appearance to be modeled in a decoupled manner. This decoupling supports an online initialization and optimization strategy that separates geometry and appearance updates, yielding stable streaming reconstruction with substantially reduced structural redundancy. PLANING improves dense mesh Chamfer-L2 by 18.52% over PGSR, surpasses ARTDECO by 1.31 dB PSNR, and reconstructs ScanNetV2 scenes in under 100 seconds, over 5x faster than 2D Gaussian Splatting, while matching the quality of offline per-scene optimization. Beyond reconstruction quality, the structural clarity and computational efficiency of PLANING make it well suited for a broad range of downstream applications, such as enabling large-scale scene modeling and simulation-ready environments for embodied AI.

| **[EmboCoach-Bench: Benchmarking AI Agents on Developing Embodied Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21570v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of Embodied AI is witnessing a rapid evolution toward general-purpose robotic systems, fueled by high-fidelity simulation and large-scale data collection. However, this scaling capability remains severely bottlenecked by a reliance on labor-intensive manual oversight from intricate reward shaping to hyperparameter tuning across heterogeneous backends. Inspired by LLMs' success in software automation and science discovery, we introduce \textsc{EmboCoach-Bench}, a benchmark evaluating the capacity of LLM agents to autonomously engineer embodied policies. Spanning 32 expert-curated RL and IL tasks, our framework posits executable code as the universal interface. We move beyond static generation to assess a dynamic closed-loop workflow, where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions, spanning improvements from physics-informed reward design to policy architectures such as diffusion policies. Extensive evaluations yield three critical insights: (1) autonomous agents can qualitatively surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5\% in average success rate; (2) agentic workflow with environment feedback effectively strengthens policy development and substantially narrows the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models; and (3) agents exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases, successfully resurrecting task performance from near-total failures through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging. Ultimately, this work establishes a foundation for self-evolving embodied intelligence, accelerating the paradigm shift from labor-intensive manual tuning to scalable, autonomous engineering in embodied AI field.</p></details> | 37 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Virtuous Machines: Towards Artificial General Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13421v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a domain-agnostic, agentic AI Scientist system can independently navigate the scientific workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness, executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments, accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored. It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and the attribution of scientific credit.</p></details> |  |

Existing spatial audio models, conversely, are constrained to fixed microphone geometries, preventing deployment across diverse devices. We present PhaseCoder, a transformer-only spatial audio encoder that is agnostic to microphone geometry. PhaseCoder takes raw multichannel audio and microphone coordinates as inputs to perform localization and produces robust spatial embeddings. We demonstrate that Gemma 3n LLM can be fine-tuned to reason over "Spatial Audio Tokens" produced by PhaseCoder. We show our encoder achieves state-of-the-art results on microphone-invariant localization benchmarks and, for the first time, enables an LLM to perform complex spatial reasoning and targeted transcription tasks from an arbitrary microphone array.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compression Tells Intelligence: Visual Coding, Visual Token Technology, and the Unification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20742v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>"Compression Tells Intelligence", is supported by research in artificial intelligence, particularly concerning (multimodal) large language models (LLMs/MLLMs), where compression efficiency often correlates with improved model performance and capabilities. For compression, classical visual coding based on traditional information theory has developed over decades, achieving great success with numerous international industrial standards widely applied in multimedia (e.g., image/video) systems. Except that, the recent emergingvisual token technology of generative multi-modal large models also shares a similar fundamental objective like visual coding: maximizing semantic information fidelity during the representation learning while minimizing computational cost. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of two dominant technique families first -- Visual Coding and Vision Token Technology -- then we further unify them from the aspect of optimization, discussing the essence of compression efficiency and model performance trade-off behind. Next, based on the proposed unified formulation bridging visual coding andvisual token technology, we synthesize bidirectional insights of themselves and forecast the next-gen visual codec and token techniques. Last but not least, we experimentally show a large potential of the task-oriented token developments in the more practical tasks like multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), AI-generated content (AIGC), and embodied AI, as well as shedding light on the future possibility of standardizing a general token technology like the traditional codecs (e.g., H.264/265) with high efficiency for a wide range of intelligent tasks in a unified and effective manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied AI with Foundation Models for Mobile Service Robots: A Systematic Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20503v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid advancements in foundation models, including Large Language Models, Vision-Language Models, Multimodal Large Language Models, and Vision-Language-Action Models, have opened new avenues for embodied AI in mobile service robotics. By combining foundation models with the principles of embodied AI, where intelligent systems perceive, reason, and act through physical interaction, mobile service robots can achieve more flexible understanding, adaptive behavior, and robust task execution in dynamic real-world environments. Despite this progress, embodied AI for mobile service robots continues to face fundamental challenges related to the translation of natural language instructions into executable robot actions, multimodal perception in human-centered environments, uncertainty estimation for safe decision-making, and computational constraints for real-time onboard deployment. In this paper, we present the first systematic review focused specifically on the integration of foundation models in mobile service robotics. We analyze how recent advances in foundation models address these core challenges through language-conditioned control, multimodal sensor fusion, uncertainty-aware reasoning, and efficient model scaling. We further examine real-world applications in domestic assistance, healthcare, and service automation, highlighting how foundation models enable context-aware, socially responsive, and generalizable robot behaviors. Beyond technical considerations, we discuss ethical, societal, and human-interaction implications associated with deploying foundation model-enabled service robots in human environments. Finally, we outline future research directions emphasizing reliability and lifelong adaptation, privacy-aware and resource-constrained deployment, and governance and human-in-the-loop frameworks required for safe, scalable, and trustworthy mobile service robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: E...</summary><p>v2: Expanded systematic review; resubmitted to Robotics</p></details> |

However, due to differences in representation and ren dering pipelines, existing studies render meshes and 3DGS separately, making it difficult to accurately handle occlusions and transparency. Moreover, the deformed 3DGS still suffers from visual artifacts due to the sensitivity to the topology quality of the proxy mesh. These issues pose serious obsta cles to the joint use of 3DGS and meshes, making it diffi cult to adapt 3DGS to conventional mesh-oriented graphics pipelines. We propose UniMGS, the first unified framework for rasterizing mesh and 3DGS in a single-pass anti-aliased manner, with a novel binding strategy for 3DGS deformation based on proxy mesh. Our key insight is to blend the col ors of both triangle and Gaussian fragments by anti-aliased α-blending in a single pass, achieving visually coherent re sults with precise handling of occlusion and transparency. To improve the visual appearance of the deformed 3DGS, our Gaussian-centric binding strategy employs a proxy mesh and spatially associates Gaussians with the mesh faces, signifi cantly reducing rendering artifacts. With these two compo nents, UniMGS enables the visualization and manipulation of 3D objects represented by mesh or 3DGS within a unified framework, opening up new possibilities in embodied AI, vir tual reality, and gaming. We will release our source code to facilitate future research.</p></details> | conference |

As the field transitions toward more complex task scenarios, multi-agent system frameworks are becoming essential for achieving scalable, efficient, and collaborative solutions. This shift is fueled by three primary factors: increasing agent capabilities, enhancing system efficiency through task delegation, and enabling advanced human-agent interactions. To address the challenges posed by multi-agent collaboration, we propose the Multi-Agent Robotic System (MARS) Challenge, held at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on SpaVLE. The competition focuses on two critical areas: planning and control, where participants explore multi-agent embodied planning using vision-language models (VLMs) to coordinate tasks and policy execution to perform robotic manipulation in dynamic environments. By evaluating solutions submitted by participants, the challenge provides valuable insights into the design and coordination of embodied multi-agent systems, contributing to the future development of advanced collaborative AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>MARS ...</summary><p>MARS Challenge @ NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Space in Vision, Language, and Embodied AI.

| **[TC-IDM: Grounding Video Generation for Executable Zero-shot Robot Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18323v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vision-language-action (VLA) paradigm has enabled powerful robotic control by leveraging vision-language models, but its reliance on large-scale, high-quality robot data limits its generalization. Generative world models offer a promising alternative for general-purpose embodied AI, yet a critical gap remains between their pixel-level plans and physically executable actions. To this end, we propose the Tool-Centric Inverse Dynamics Model (TC-IDM). By focusing on the tool's imagined trajectory as synthesized by the world model, TC-IDM establishes a robust intermediate representation that bridges the gap between visual planning and physical control. TC-IDM extracts the tool's point cloud trajectories via segmentation and 3D motion estimation from generated videos. Considering diverse tool attributes, our architecture employs decoupled action heads to project these planned trajectories into 6-DoF end-effector motions and corresponding control signals. This plan-and-translate paradigm not only supports a wide range of end-effectors but also significantly improves viewpoint invariance. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization capabilities across long-horizon and out-of-distribution tasks, including interacting with deformable objects. In real-world evaluations, the world model with TC-IDM achieves an average success rate of 61.11 percent, with 77.7 percent on simple tasks and 38.46 percent on zero-shot deformable object tasks. It substantially outperforms end-to-end VLA-style baselines and other inverse dynamics models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPACE-CLIP: Spatial Perception via Adaptive CLIP Embeddings for Monocular Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17657v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has accomplished extraordinary success for semantic understanding but inherently struggles to perceive geometric structure. Existing methods attempt to bridge this gap by querying CLIP with textual prompts, a process that is often indirect and inefficient. This paper introduces a fundamentally different approach using a dual-pathway decoder. We present SPACE-CLIP, an architecture that unlocks and interprets latent geometric knowledge directly from a frozen CLIP vision encoder, completely bypassing the text encoder and its associated textual prompts. A semantic pathway interprets high-level features, dynamically conditioned on global context using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). In addition, a structural pathway extracts fine-grained spatial details from early layers. These complementary streams are hierarchically fused, enabling a robust synthesis of semantic context and precise geometry. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that SPACE-CLIP dramatically outperforms previous CLIP-based methods. Our ablation studies validate that the synergistic fusion of our dual pathways is critical to this success. SPACE-CLIP offers a new, efficient, and architecturally elegant blueprint for repurposing large-scale vision models. The proposed method is not just a standalone depth estimator, but a readily integrable spatial perception module for the next generation of embodied AI systems, such as vision-language-action (VLA) models. Our model is available at https://github.com/taewan2002/space-clip</p></details> |  |

However, current work has been mainly focused on indoor, household scenarios. In this work, we present SimWorld-Robotics~(SWR), a simulation platform for embodied AI in large-scale, photorealistic urban environments. Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication. With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other. Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication. Our experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models, including vision-language models (VLMs), struggle with our tasks, lacking robust perception, reasoning, and planning abilities necessary for urban environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference: NeurIPS 2025 (main)</p></details> |
| **[The Spatial Blindspot of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09954v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, but their ability to capture spatial relationships remains a blindspot. Current VLMs are typically built with contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) style image encoders. The training recipe often flattens images into 1D patch sequences, discarding the 2D structure necessary for spatial reasoning. We argue that this lack of spatial awareness is a missing dimension in VLM design and a bottleneck for applications requiring spatial grounding, such as robotics and embodied AI. To address this, we investigate (i) image encoders trained with alternative objectives and (ii) 2D positional encodings. Our experiments show that these architectural choices can lead to improved spatial reasoning on several benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work done as part of the EleutherAI SOAR Program</p></details> |

While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Track on Datasets and Benchmarks.

| **[Rethinking Video Generation Model for the Embodied World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15282v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models have significantly advanced embodied intelligence, unlocking new possibilities for generating diverse robot data that capture perception, reasoning, and action in the physical world. However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations. Collectively, this synergistic ecosystem of evaluation and data establishes a robust foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating the evolution of embodied AI toward general intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github: https://github.com/DAGroup-PKU/ReVidgen/ Project website: https://dagroup-pku.github.io/ReVidgen.github.io/</p></details> |

Building upon its predecessor, RoboBrain 2.5 introduces two major capability upgrades. Specifically, it unlocks Precise 3D Spatial Reasoning by shifting from 2D pixel-relative grounding to depth-aware coordinate prediction and absolute metric constraint comprehension, generating complete 3D manipulation traces as ordered keypoint sequences under physical constraints. Complementing this spatial precision, the model establishes Dense Temporal Value Estimation that provides dense, step-aware progress prediction and execution state understanding across varying viewpoints, producing stable feedback signals for downstream learning. Together, these upgrades extend the framework toward more physically grounded and execution-aware embodied intelligence for complex, fine-grained manipulation.

| **[CREATE: Cross-Layer Resilience Characterization and Optimization for Efficient yet Reliable Embodied AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14140v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) has recently attracted significant attention as it bridges AI with the physical world. Modern embodied AI systems often combine a Large Language Model (LLM)-based planner for high-level task planning and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based controller for low-level action generation, enabling embodied agents to tackle complex tasks in real-world environments. However, deploying embodied agents remains challenging due to their high computation requirements, especially for battery-powered local devices. Although techniques like lowering operating voltage can improve energy efficiency, they can introduce bit errors and result in task failures. In this work, we propose CREATE, a general design principle that leverages heterogeneous resilience at different layers for synergistic energy-reliability co-optimization. For the first time, we conduct a comprehensive error injection study on modern embodied AI systems and observe an inherent but heterogeneous fault tolerance. Building upon these insights, we develop an anomaly detection and clearance mechanism at the circuit level to eliminate outlier errors. At the model level, we propose a weight-rotation-enhanced planning algorithm to improve the fault tolerance of the LLM-based planner. Furthermore, we introduce an application-level technique, autonomy-adaptive voltage scaling, to dynamically adjust the operating voltage of the controllers. The voltage scaling circuit is co-designed to enable online voltage adjustment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that without compromising task quality, CREATE achieves 40.6% computational energy savings on average over nominal-voltage baselines and 35.0% over prior-art techniques. This further leads to 29.5% to 37.3% chip-level energy savings and approximately a 15% to 30% improvement in battery life.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 21 figures.

Existing benchmarks primarily emphasize indoor or street settings, overlooking the unique challenges of open-ended urban spaces characterized by rich semantics, complex geometries, and view variations. To address this, we introduce CityCube, a systematic benchmark designed to probe cross-view reasoning capabilities of current VLMs in urban settings. CityCube integrates four viewpoint dynamics to mimic camera movements and spans a wide spectrum of perspectives from multiple platforms, e.g., vehicles, drones and satellites. For a comprehensive assessment, it features 5,022 meticulously annotated multi-view QA pairs categorized into five cognitive dimensions and three spatial relation expressions. A comprehensive evaluation of 33 VLMs reveals a significant performance disparity with humans: even large-scale models struggle to exceed 54.1% accuracy, remaining 34.2% below human performance. By contrast, small-scale fine-tuned VLMs achieve over 60.0% accuracy, highlighting the necessity of our benchmark. Further analyses indicate the task correlations and fundamental cognitive disparity between VLMs and human-like reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Coordination with the System-Level Shared State: An Embodied-AI Native Modular Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13945v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Embodied AI systems move from research prototypes to real world deployments, they tend to evolve rapidly while remaining reliable under workload changes and partial failures. In practice, many deployments are only partially decoupled: middleware moves messages, but shared context and feedback semantics are implicit, causing interface drift, cross-module interference, and brittle recovery at scale. We present ANCHOR, a modular framework that makes decoupling and robustness explicit system-level primitives. ANCHOR separates (i) Canonical Records, an evolvable contract for the standardized shared state, from (ii) a communication bus for many-to-many dissemination and feedback-oriented coordination, forming an inspectable end-to-end loop. We validate closed-loop feasibility on a de-identified workflow instantiation, characterize latency distributions under varying payload sizes and publish rates, and demonstrate automatic stream resumption after hard crashes and restarts even with shared-memory loss. Overall, ANCHOR turns ad-hoc integration glue into explicit contracts, enabling controlled degradation under load and self-healing recovery for scalable deployment of closed-loop AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Although recent latent action policy optimization (LAPO) has shown promise in inferring proxy action labels from visual observations, its performance degrades significantly when distractors are present. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric latent action learning framework that centers on objects rather than pixels. We leverage self-supervised object-centric pretraining to disentangle the movement of the agent and distracting background dynamics. This allows LAPO to focus on task-relevant interactions, resulting in more robust proxy-action labels, enabling better imitation learning and efficient adaptation of the agent with just a few action-labeled trajectories. We evaluated our method in eight visually complex tasks across the Distracting Control Suite (DCS) and Distracting MetaWorld (DMW). Our results show that object-centric pretraining mitigates the negative effects of distractors by 50%, as measured by downstream task performance: average return (DCS) and success rate (DMW).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (Oral).

However, existing environment generation methods often emphasize visual realism (e.g., object diversity and layout coherence), overlooking a crucial aspect: logical diversity from the testing perspective. This limits the comprehensive evaluation of agent adaptability and planning robustness in distinct simulated environments. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicEnvGen, a novel method driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) that adopts a top-down paradigm to generate logically diverse simulated environments as test cases for agents. Given an agent task, LogicEnvGen first analyzes its execution logic to construct decision-tree-structured behavior plans and then synthesizes a set of logical trajectories. Subsequently, it adopts a heuristic algorithm to refine the trajectory set, reducing redundant simulation. For each logical trajectory, which represents a potential task situation, LogicEnvGen correspondingly instantiates a concrete environment. Notably, it employs constraint solving for physical plausibility. Furthermore, we introduce LogicEnvEval, a novel benchmark comprising four quantitative metrics for environment evaluation. Experimental results verify the lack of logical diversity in baselines and demonstrate that LogicEnvGen achieves 1.04-2.61x greater diversity, significantly improving the performance in revealing agent faults by 4.00%-68.00%.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 15 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, these datasets and their task designs often lack systematic consideration and principles. This raises important questions: Do the current datasets and task designs truly advance the capabilities of robotic agents? Do evaluations on a few common tasks accurately reflect the differentiated performance of various methods proposed by different teams and evaluated on different tasks? To address these issues, we introduce the Great March 100 (\textbf{GM-100}) as the first step towards a robot learning Olympics. GM-100 consists of 100 carefully designed tasks that cover a wide range of interactions and long-tail behaviors, aiming to provide a diverse and challenging set of tasks to comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of robotic agents and promote diversity and complexity in robot dataset task designs. These tasks are developed through systematic analysis and expansion of existing task designs, combined with insights from human-object interaction primitives and object affordances. We collect a large amount of trajectory data on different robotic platforms and evaluate several baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that the GM-100 tasks are 1) feasible to execute and 2) sufficiently challenging to effectively differentiate the performance of current VLA models. Our data and code are available at https://rhos.ai/research/gm-100.</p></details> |  |

However, existing generative approaches often fail to capture the functional complexity of real-world interiors, particularly those containing articulated objects with movable parts essential for manipulation and navigation. This paper presents SceneFoundry, a language-guided diffusion framework that generates apartment-scale 3D worlds with functionally articulated furniture and semantically diverse layouts for robotic training. From natural language prompts, an LLM module controls floor layout generation, while diffusion-based posterior sampling efficiently populates the scene with articulated assets from large-scale 3D repositories. To ensure physical usability, SceneFoundry employs differentiable guidance functions to regulate object quantity, prevent articulation collisions, and maintain sufficient walkable space for robotic navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates structurally valid, semantically coherent, and functionally interactive environments across diverse scene types and conditions, enabling scalable embodied AI research. project page: https://anc891203.github.io/SceneFoundry-Demo/</p></details> | 15 pages |

While recent VLMs demonstrate strong performance on multimodal benchmarks, their robustness to realistic perception degradation remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically study semantic misalignment in VLMs under controlled degradation of upstream visual perception, using semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset as a representative perception module. We introduce perception-realistic corruptions that induce only moderate drops in conventional segmentation metrics, yet observe severe failures in downstream VLM behavior, including hallucinated object mentions, omission of safety-critical entities, and inconsistent safety judgments. To quantify these effects, we propose a set of language-level misalignment metrics that capture hallucination, critical omission, and safety misinterpretation, and analyze their relationship with segmentation quality across multiple contrastive and generative VLMs. Our results reveal a clear disconnect between pixel-level robustness and multimodal semantic reliability, highlighting a critical limitation of current VLM-based systems and motivating the need for evaluation frameworks that explicitly account for perception uncertainty in safety-critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ayushtewari.com/projects/srender/</p></details> |

An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v4)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

We present VirtualEnv, a next-generation simulation platform built on Unreal Engine 5 that enables fine-grained benchmarking of LLMs in embodied and interactive scenarios. VirtualEnv supports rich agent-environment interactions, including object manipulation, navigation, and adaptive multi-agent collaboration, as well as game-inspired mechanics like escape rooms and procedurally generated environments. We provide a user-friendly API built on top of Unreal Engine, allowing researchers to deploy and control LLM-driven agents using natural language instructions. We integrate large-scale LLMs and vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-based models, to generate novel environments and structured tasks from multimodal inputs. Our experiments benchmark the performance of several popular LLMs across tasks of increasing complexity, analyzing differences in adaptability, planning, and multi-agent coordination. We also describe our methodology for procedural task generation, task validation, and real-time environment control. VirtualEnv is released as an open-source platform, we aim to advance research at the intersection of AI and gaming, enable standardized evaluation of LLMs in embodied AI settings, and pave the way for future developments in immersive simulations and interactive entertainment.</p></details> |  |

Early studies have combined manual engineering with deep neural networks, achieving notable progress in specific semantic-related embodied tasks. However, as embodied agents encounter increasingly complex environments and open-ended tasks, the demand for more generalizable and robust semantic processing capabilities has become imperative. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) address this challenge through their cross-domain generalization abilities and rich semantic priors, reshaping the landscape of embodied AI research. In this survey, we propose the Semantic Lifecycle as a unified framework to characterize the evolution of semantic knowledge within embodied AI driven by foundation models. Departing from traditional paradigms that treat semantic processing as isolated modules or disjoint tasks, our framework offers a holistic perspective that captures the continuous flow and maintenance of semantic knowledge. Guided by this embodied semantic lifecycle, we further analyze and compare recent advances across three key stages: acquisition, representation, and storage. Finally, we summarize existing challenges and outline promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

We take a radically different tack to the issue of reliable embodied AI: instead of focusing on formal verification methods aimed at achieving model predictability and robustness, we emphasise the dynamic, ambiguous and subjective nature of human-robot interactions that requires embodied AI systems to perceive, interpret, and respond to human intentions in a manner that is consistent, comprehensible and aligned with human expectations. We argue that when embodied agents operate in human environments that are inherently social, multimodal, and fluid, reliability is contextually determined and only has meaning in relation to the goals and expectations of humans involved in the interaction.

In this paper, we introduce QMAVIS (Q Team-Multimodal Audio Video Intelligent Sensemaking), a novel long video-audio understanding pipeline built through a late fusion of LMMs, Large Language Models, and speech recognition models. QMAVIS addresses the gap in long-form video analytics, particularly for longer videos of a few minutes to beyond an hour long, opening up new potential applications in sensemaking, video content analysis, embodied AI, etc. Quantitative experiments using QMAVIS demonstrated a 38.75% improvement over state-of-the-art video-audio LMMs like VideoLlaMA2 and InternVL2 on the VideoMME (with subtitles) dataset, which comprises long videos with audio information. Evaluations on other challenging video understanding datasets like PerceptionTest and EgoSchema saw up to 2% improvement, indicating competitive performance. Qualitative experiments also showed that QMAVIS is able to extract the nuances of different scenes in a long video audio content while understanding the overarching narrative. Ablation studies were also conducted to ascertain the impact of each component in the fusion pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05991v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In safety-critical domains, linguistic ambiguity can have severe consequences; a vague command like "Pass me the vial" in a surgical setting could lead to catastrophic errors. Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a fundamental new task where a model must determine if a command has a single, unambiguous meaning within a given 3D scene. To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions. Our analysis reveals a surprising limitation: state-of-the-art 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reliably determine if an instruction is ambiguous. To address this challenge, we propose AmbiVer, a two-stage framework that collects explicit visual evidence from multiple views and uses it to guide an vision-language model (VLM) in judging instruction ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the challenge of our task and the effectiveness of AmbiVer, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy embodied AI.

Yet, research on continual and transfer learning in 3D point cloud perception remains underexplored compared to 2D vision -- particularly under simultaneous domain and label shifts. To address this gap, we propose the RObust Autonomous driving under Dataset shifts (ROAD) benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation suite for LiDAR-based object classification that explicitly accounts for domain shifts as well as three key forms of label evolution: class split, class expansion, and class insertion. Using large-scale datasets (Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse2), we evaluate zero-shot transfer, linear probe, and CL, and analyze the impact of backbone architectures, training objectives, and CL methods. Our findings reveal limitations of existing approaches under realistic shifts and establish strong baselines for future research in robust 3D perception.</p></details> |  |

A Comprehensive Embodied World Model Evaluation Turing Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04137v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As world models gain momentum in Embodied AI, an increasing number of works explore using video foundation models as predictive world models for downstream embodied tasks like 3D prediction or interactive generation. However, before exploring these downstream tasks, video foundation models still have two critical questions unanswered: (1) whether their generative generalization is sufficient to maintain perceptual fidelity in the eyes of human observers, and (2) whether they are robust enough to serve as a universal prior for real-world embodied agents. To provide a standardized framework for answering these questions, we introduce the Embodied Turing Test benchmark: WoW-World-Eval (Wow,wo,val). Building upon 609 robot manipulation data, Wow-wo-val examines five core abilities, including perception, planning, prediction, generalization, and execution. We propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol with 22 metrics to assess the models' generation ability, which achieves a high Pearson Correlation between the overall score and human preference (>0.93) and establishes a reliable foundation for the Human Turing Test. On Wow-wo-val, models achieve only 17.27 on long-horizon planning and at best 68.02 on physical consistency, indicating limited spatiotemporal consistency and physical reasoning. For the Inverse Dynamic Model Turing Test, we first use an IDM to evaluate the video foundation models' execution accuracy in the real world. However, most models collapse to $\approx$ 0% success, while WoW maintains a 40.74% success rate. These findings point to a noticeable gap between the generated videos and the real world, highlighting the urgency and necessity of benchmarking World Model in Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, their complex multimodal interactions also expose new security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we investigate a backdoor threat in VLA models, where malicious inputs cause targeted misbehavior while preserving performance on clean data. Existing backdoor methods predominantly rely on inserting visible triggers into visual modality, which suffer from poor robustness and low insusceptibility in real-world settings due to environmental variability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the State Backdoor, a novel and practical backdoor attack that leverages the robot arm's initial state as the trigger. To optimize trigger for insusceptibility and effectiveness, we design a Preference-guided Genetic Algorithm (PGA) that efficiently searches the state space for minimal yet potent triggers. Extensive experiments on five representative VLA models and five real-world tasks show that our method achieves over 90% attack success rate without affecting benign task performance, revealing an underexplored vulnerability in embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limited Linguistic Diversity in Embodied AI Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03136v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language plays a critical role in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, yet the linguistic characteristics of the datasets used to train and evaluate these systems remain poorly documented. In this work, we present a systematic dataset audit of several widely used VLA corpora, aiming to characterize what kinds of instructions these datasets actually contain and how much linguistic variety they provide. We quantify instruction language along complementary dimensions-including lexical variety, duplication and overlap, semantic similarity, and syntactic complexity. Our analysis shows that many datasets rely on highly repetitive, template-like commands with limited structural variation, yielding a narrow distribution of instruction forms. We position these findings as descriptive documentation of the language signal available in current VLA training and evaluation data, intended to support more detailed dataset reporting, more principled dataset selection, and targeted curation or augmentation strategies that broaden language coverage.</p></details> |  |

Exploiting the redundancy in latent representations could improve system efficiency, yet existing approaches often rely on costly dataset-specific ablation tests or heavy entropy models unsuitable for real-time edge-robot collaboration. We propose a generalizable, dataset-agnostic method to identify and selectively transmit structure-critical channels in pretrained encoders. Instead of brute-force empirical evaluations, our approach leverages intrinsic parameter statistics-weight variances and biases-to estimate channel importance. This analysis reveals a consistent organizational structure, termed the Invariant Salient Channel Space (ISCS), where Salient-Core channels capture dominant structures while Salient-Auxiliary channels encode fine visual details. Building on ISCS, we introduce a deterministic static pruning strategy that enables lightweight split-computing. Experiments across different datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a deterministic, ultra-low latency pipeline by bypassing heavy entropy modeling. Our method reduces end-to-end latency, providing a critical speed-accuracy trade-off for resource-constrained human-aware embodied systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Signi...</summary><p>Significant revision: The focus has been pivoted from learned image compression to embodied perception tasks.

BEHAVIOR-1K focuses on everyday household tasks that people most want robots to assist with and these tasks introduce long-horizon mobile manipulation challenges in realistic settings, bridging the gap between current research and real-world, human-centric applications. This report presents our solution to the 2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge in a very close 2nd place and substantially outperforms the rest of the submissions. Building on $π_{0.5}$, we focus on systematically building our solution by studying the effects of training techniques and data. Through careful ablation studies, we reveal the scaling benefits in both the pre-training and post-training phases, leading to a validation Q-score of 0.345, significantly surpassing previous state-of-the-art performance.

| **[Plan Verification for LLM-Based Embodied Task Completion Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02761v4)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions, redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches, our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout). The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied AI-Enhanced IoMT Edge Computing: UAV Trajectory Optimization and Task Offloading with Mobility Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20902v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to their inherent flexibility and autonomous operation, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to provide real-time biomedical edge computing service for wireless body area network (WBAN) users. In this paper, considering the time-varying task criticality characteristics of diverse WBAN users and the dual mobility between WBAN users and UAV, we investigate the dynamic task offloading and UAV flight trajectory optimization problem to minimize the weighted average task completion time of all the WBAN users, under the constraint of UAV energy consumption. To tackle the problem, an embodied AI-enhanced IoMT edge computing framework is established. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical multi-scale Transformer-based user trajectory prediction model based on the users' historical trajectory traces captured by the embodied AI agent (i.e., UAV). Afterwards, a prediction-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that integrates predicted users' mobility information is designed for intelligently optimizing UAV flight trajectory and task offloading decisions. Real-word movement traces and simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in comparison with the existing benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026, the Project website is available at https://qhemu.github.io/CCoL/</p></details> |

Embodied intelligence focuses on training agents within realistic simulated environments, leveraging physical interaction and action feedback rather than conventionally labeled datasets. Yet, most existing simulation platforms remain narrowly designed, each tailored to specific tasks. A versatile, general-purpose training environment that can support everything from low-level embodied navigation to high-level composite activities, such as multi-agent social simulation and human-AI collaboration, remains largely unavailable. To bridge this gap, we introduce TongSIM, a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform for training and evaluating embodied agents. TongSIM offers practical advantages by providing over 100 diverse, multi-room indoor scenarios as well as an open-ended, interaction-rich outdoor town simulation, ensuring broad applicability across research needs. Its comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmarks enable precise assessment of agent capabilities, such as perception, cognition, decision-making, human-robot cooperation, and spatial and social reasoning. With features like customized scenes, task-adaptive fidelity, diverse agent types, and dynamic environmental simulation, TongSIM delivers flexibility and scalability for researchers, serving as a unified platform that accelerates training, evaluation, and advancement toward general embodied intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[IndoorUAV: Benchmarking Vision-Language UAV Navigation in Continuous Indoor Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19024v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) enables agents to navigate in complex environments by following natural language instructions grounded in visual observations. Although most existing work has focused on ground-based robots or outdoor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), indoor UAV-based VLN remains underexplored, despite its relevance to real-world applications such as inspection, delivery, and search-and-rescue in confined spaces. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{IndoorUAV}, a novel benchmark and method specifically tailored for VLN with indoor UAVs. We begin by curating over 1,000 diverse and structurally rich 3D indoor scenes from the Habitat simulator. Within these environments, we simulate realistic UAV flight dynamics to collect diverse 3D navigation trajectories manually, further enriched through data augmentation techniques. Furthermore, we design an automated annotation pipeline to generate natural language instructions of varying granularity for each trajectory. This process yields over 16,000 high-quality trajectories, comprising the \textbf{IndoorUAV-VLN} subset, which focuses on long-horizon VLN. To support short-horizon planning, we segment long trajectories into sub-trajectories by selecting semantically salient keyframes and regenerating concise instructions, forming the \textbf{IndoorUAV-VLA} subset. Finally, we introduce \textbf{IndoorUAV-Agent}, a novel navigation model designed for our benchmark, leveraging task decomposition and multimodal reasoning. We hope IndoorUAV serves as a valuable resource to advance research on vision-language embodied AI in the indoor aerial navigation domain.</p></details> |  |

These shortcomings limit the insight that the benchmarks provide into sim-to-real generalization, and create a significant research gap. Furthermore, task fragmentation prevents unified/shared progress in the area, while limited data scales fail to meet the demands of modern LLM-based pretraining. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VLNVerse: a new large-scale, extensible benchmark designed for Versatile, Embodied, Realistic Simulation, and Evaluation. VLNVerse redefines VLN as a scalable, full-stack embodied AI problem. Its Versatile nature unifies previously fragmented tasks into a single framework and provides an extensible toolkit for researchers. Its Embodied design moves beyond intangible and teleporting "ghost" agents that support full-kinematics in a Realistic Simulation powered by a robust physics engine. We leverage the scale and diversity of VLNVerse to conduct a comprehensive Evaluation of existing methods, from classic models to MLLM-based agents. We also propose a novel unified multi-task model capable of addressing all tasks within the benchmark. VLNVerse aims to narrow the gap between simulated navigation and real-world generalization, providing the community with a vital tool to boost research towards scalable, general-purpose embodied locomotion agents.</p></details> |  |

We introduce FreeAskWorld, an interactive simulation framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) for high-level behavior planning and semantically grounded interaction, informed by theories of intention and social cognition. Our framework supports scalable, realistic human-agent simulations and includes a modular data generation pipeline tailored for diverse embodied tasks. To validate the framework, we extend the classic Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task into a interaction enriched Direction Inquiry setting, wherein agents can actively seek and interpret navigational guidance. We present and publicly release FreeAskWorld, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising reconstructed environments, six diverse task types, 16 core object categories, 63,429 annotated sample frames, and more than 17 hours of interaction data to support training and evaluation of embodied AI systems. We benchmark VLN models, and human participants under both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Experimental results demonstrate that models fine-tuned on FreeAskWorld outperform their original counterparts, achieving enhanced semantic understanding and interaction competency. These findings underscore the efficacy of socially grounded simulation frameworks in advancing embodied AI systems toward sophisticated high-level planning and more naturalistic human-agent interaction. Importantly, our work underscores that interaction itself serves as an additional information modality.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative: they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction, enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation. Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at https://worv-ai.github.io/d2e/</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling the Mental World for Embodied AI: A Comprehensive Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02378v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the application of Embodied AI Agents in avatars, wearable devices, and robotic systems continues to deepen, their core research challenges have gradually shifted from physical environment interaction to the accurate understanding of social interactions. Traditional physical world models (PWM) focus on quantifiable physical attributes such as space and motion, failing to meet the needs of social intelligence modeling. In contrast, the Mental World Model (MWM), as a structured representation of humans' internal mental states, has become the critical cognitive foundation for embodied agents to achieve natural human-machine collaboration and dynamic social adaptation. However, current MWM research faces significant bottlenecks: such as fragmented conceptual framework with vague boundaries between MWM and PWM, disjointed reasoning mechanisms for the technical pathways and applicable scenarios of different Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning paradigms, and detachment between evaluation and practice. To address these issues, this review systematically synthesizes over 100 authoritative studies to provide a comprehensive overview of MWM research for embodied AI. Its core contributions are threefold: First, it constructs a complete theoretical framework for MWM for the first time. Specifically, it distinguishes the essential differences between MWM and PWMs. Second, it systematically defines the key components of MWM through two paradigms for mental element representation. Third, it comprehensively analyzes two core ToM reasoning paradigms with 19 ToM methods. Finally, it also clarifies the integration trend of neuro-symbolic hybrid architectures, and synthesizes 26 ToM evaluation benchmarks. This work aims to promote the integration of embodied agents into human society and advance the in-depth development of human-machine collaborative interaction.</p></details> |  |

However, a key challenge remains underexplored: how can we advance LMMs to discover tasks that assist humans in open-future scenarios, where human intentions are highly concurrent and dynamic. In this work, we formalize the problem of Human-centric Open-future Task Discovery (HOTD), focusing particularly on identifying tasks that reduce human effort across plausible futures. To facilitate this study, we propose HOTD-Bench, which features over 2K real-world videos, a semi-automated annotation pipeline, and a simulation-based protocol tailored for open-set future evaluation. Additionally, we propose the Collaborative Multi-Agent Search Tree (CMAST) framework, which decomposes complex reasoning through a multi-agent system and structures the reasoning process through a scalable search tree module. In our experiments, CMAST achieves the best performance on the HOTD-Bench, significantly surpassing existing LMMs. It also integrates well with existing LMMs, consistently improving performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to AAAI 2026, 10 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |

Prevailing end-to-end models couple high-level reasoning and low-level grounding into a single monolithic pipeline and rely on training over annotated datasets, which leads to poor generalization on novel objects and unseen environments. In this paper, we move beyond this paradigm by proposing A4-Agent, a training-free agentic framework that decouples affordance prediction into a three-stage pipeline. Our framework coordinates specialized foundation models at test time: (1) a $\textbf{Dreamer}$ that employs generative models to visualize $\textit{how}$ an interaction would look; (2) a $\textbf{Thinker}$ that utilizes large vision-language models to decide $\textit{what}$ object part to interact with; and (3) a $\textbf{Spotter}$ that orchestrates vision foundation models to precisely locate $\textit{where}$ the interaction area is. By leveraging the complementary strengths of pre-trained models without any task-specific fine-tuning, our zero-shot framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods across multiple benchmarks and demonstrates robust generalization to real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

Recent works on trajectory-conditioned video generation address this gap but often rely on 2D trajectories or single modality conditioning, which restricts their ability to produce controllable and consistent robotic demonstrations. We present DRAW2ACT, a depth-aware trajectory-conditioned video generation framework that extracts multiple orthogonal representations from the input trajectory, capturing depth, semantics, shape and motion, and injects them into the diffusion model. Moreover, we propose to jointly generate spatially aligned RGB and depth videos, leveraging cross-modality attention mechanisms and depth supervision to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency. Finally, we introduce a multimodal policy model conditioned on the generated RGB and depth sequences to regress the robot's joint angles. Experiments on Bridge V2, Berkeley Autolab, and simulation benchmarks show that DRAW2ACT achieves superior visual fidelity and consistency while yielding higher manipulation success rates compared to existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior work focused on object-level edits, Do-Undo requires models to simulate the outcome of a physical action and then accurately reverse it, reflecting true cause-and-effect in the visual world. We curate a large-scale dataset of reversible actions from real-world videos and design a training strategy enforcing consistency for robust action grounding. Our experiments reveal that current models struggle with physical reversibility, underscoring the importance of this task for embodied AI, robotics, and physics-aware generative modeling. Do-Undo establishes an intuitive testbed for evaluating and advancing physical reasoning in multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |

However, existing generative policies often struggle with data inefficiency, requiring large-scale demonstrations, and sampling inefficiency, incurring slow action generation during inference. We introduce EfficientFlow, a unified framework for efficient embodied AI with flow-based policy learning. To enhance data efficiency, we bring equivariance into flow matching. We theoretically prove that when using an isotropic Gaussian prior and an equivariant velocity prediction network, the resulting action distribution remains equivariant, leading to improved generalization and substantially reduced data demands. To accelerate sampling, we propose a novel acceleration regularization strategy. As direct computation of acceleration is intractable for marginal flow trajectories, we derive a novel surrogate loss that enables stable and scalable training using only conditional trajectories. Across a wide range of robotic manipulation benchmarks, the proposed algorithm achieves competitive or superior performance under limited data while offering dramatically faster inference. These results highlight EfficientFlow as a powerful and efficient paradigm for high-performance embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026.

However, with the rapid evolution of machine intelligence, the target of compression has shifted from task-specific virtual models to Embodied agents operating in real-world environments. To address the communication constraints of Embodied AI in multi-agent systems and ensure real-time task execution, this paper introduces, for the first time, the scientific problem of Embodied Image Compression. We establish a standardized benchmark, EmbodiedComp, to facilitate systematic evaluation under ultra-low bitrate conditions in a closed-loop setting. Through extensive empirical studies in both simulated and real-world settings, we demonstrate that existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) fail to reliably perform even simple manipulation tasks when compressed below the Embodied bitrate threshold. We anticipate that EmbodiedComp will catalyze the development of domain-specific compression tailored for Embodied agents , thereby accelerating the Embodied AI deployment in the Real-world.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Yet existing approaches either handle a narrow range of input modalities or rely on stochastic processes that hinder controllability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce RoomPilot, a unified framework that parses diverse multi-modal inputs--textual descriptions or CAD floor plans--into an Indoor Domain-Specific Language (IDSL) for indoor structured scene generation. The key insight is that a well-designed IDSL can act as a shared semantic representation, enabling coherent, high-quality scene synthesis from any single modality while maintaining interaction semantics. In contrast to conventional procedural methods that produce visually plausible but functionally inert layouts, RoomPilot leverages a curated dataset of interaction-annotated assets to synthesize environments exhibiting realistic object behaviors. Extensive experiments further validate its strong multi-modal understanding, fine-grained controllability in scene generation, and superior physical consistency and visual fidelity, marking a significant step toward general-purpose controllable 3D indoor scene generation.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |

Despite rapid progress, the field still lacks a unified way to assess whether generated worlds preserve geometry, obey physics, or support reliable control. We introduce WorldLens, a full-spectrum benchmark evaluating how well a model builds, understands, and behaves within its generated world. It spans five aspects -- Generation, Reconstruction, Action-Following, Downstream Task, and Human Preference -- jointly covering visual realism, geometric consistency, physical plausibility, and functional reliability. Across these dimensions, no existing world model excels universally: those with strong textures often violate physics, while geometry-stable ones lack behavioral fidelity. To align objective metrics with human judgment, we further construct WorldLens-26K, a large-scale dataset of human-annotated videos with numerical scores and textual rationales, and develop WorldLens-Agent, an evaluation model distilled from these annotations to enable scalable, explainable scoring. Together, the benchmark, dataset, and agent form a unified ecosystem for measuring world fidelity -- standardizing how future models are judged not only by how real they look, but by how real they behave.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 80 pages, 37 figures, 29 tables; Project Page at https://worldbench.github.io/worldlens</p></details> |

While current models excel at capturing an object's surface geometry and appearance, they largely neglect its internal physical properties. This omission is critical, as properties like volumetric density are fundamental for predicting an object's center of mass, stability, and interaction dynamics in applications ranging from robotic manipulation to physical simulation. The primary bottleneck has been the absence of large-scale, real-world data. To bridge this gap, we introduce XDen-1K, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset designed for real-world physical property estimation, with a particular focus on volumetric density. The core of this dataset consists of 1,000 real-world objects across 148 categories, for which we provide comprehensive multi-modal data, including a high-resolution 3D geometric model with part-level annotations and a corresponding set of real-world biplanar X-ray scans. Building upon this data, we introduce a novel optimization framework that recovers a high-fidelity volumetric density field of each object from its sparse X-ray views. To demonstrate its practical value, we add X-ray images as a conditioning signal to an existing segmentation network and perform volumetric segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on downstream robotics tasks. The results show that leveraging the dataset can effectively improve the accuracy of center-of-mass estimation and the success rate of robotic manipulation. We believe XDen-1K will serve as a foundational resource and a challenging new benchmark, catalyzing future research in physically grounded visual inference and embodied AI.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

To overcome these limitations, we propose RoboNeuron, a universal deployment framework for embodied intelligence. RoboNeuron is the first framework to deeply integrate the cognitive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models with the real-time execution backbone of the Robot Operating System (ROS). We utilize the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a semantic bridge, enabling the LLM to dynamically orchestrate underlying robotic tools. The framework establishes a highly modular architecture that strictly decouples sensing, reasoning, and control by leveraging ROS's unified communication interfaces. Crucially, we introduce an automated tool to translate ROS messages into callable MCP functions, significantly streamlining development. RoboNeuron significantly enhances cross-scenario adaptability and component flexibility, while establishing a systematic platform for horizontal performance benchmarking, laying a robust foundation for scalable real-world embodied applications.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we tackle the challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture. Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for extra optimization or asset retrieval; (ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of 3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass; (iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our architecture yields improved generation performance when multiple images are provided; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the efficiency and robustness of our approach. We believe this paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation, potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks.

However, standardized benchmarks for evaluating these capabilities in real-world settings, and in direct comparison to humans, remain scarce. Existing evaluations often rely on pre-collected human motion datasets or simulation-based experiments, which limit reproducibility, overlook hardware factors, and hinder fair human-robot comparisons. We present Switch-JustDance, a low-cost and reproducible benchmarking pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games, Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch, to evaluate robot whole-body control. Using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch as a representative platform, Switch-JustDance converts in-game choreography into robot-executable motions through streaming, motion reconstruction, and motion retargeting modules and enables users to evaluate controller performance through the game's built-in scoring system. We first validate the evaluation properties of Just Dance, analyzing its reliability, validity, sensitivity, and potential sources of bias. Our results show that the platform provides consistent and interpretable performance measures, making it a suitable tool for benchmarking embodied AI. Building on this foundation, we benchmark three state-of-the-art humanoid whole-body controllers on hardware and provide insights into their relative strengths and limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Camera Positional Encoding for Controlled Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07237v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have emerged as a universal backbone across 3D perception, video generation, and world models for autonomous driving and embodied AI, where understanding camera geometry is essential for grounding visual observations in three-dimensional space. However, existing camera encoding methods often rely on simplified pinhole assumptions, restricting generalization across the diverse intrinsics and lens distortions in real-world cameras. We introduce Relative Ray Encoding, a geometry-consistent representation that unifies complete camera information, including 6-DoF poses, intrinsics, and lens distortions. To evaluate its capability under diverse controllability demands, we adopt camera-controlled text-to-video generation as a testbed task. Within this setting, we further identify pitch and roll as two components effective for Absolute Orientation Encoding, enabling full control over the initial camera orientation. Together, these designs form UCPE (Unified Camera Positional Encoding), which integrates into a pretrained video Diffusion Transformer through a lightweight spatial attention adapter, adding less than 1% trainable parameters while achieving state-of-the-art camera controllability and visual fidelity. To facilitate systematic training and evaluation, we construct a large video dataset covering a wide range of camera motions and lens types. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of UCPE in camera-controllable video generation and highlight its potential as a general camera representation for Transformers across future multi-view, video, and 3D tasks.

Recent approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for ICLR 2026 conference</p></details> |

However, it is still far from being realized in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), especially in achieving precise point-level correspondence, which is crucial for precise affordance interaction. So we propose the Cross-View Point Correspondence (CVPC) task and CrossPoint-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with hierarchical design, inspired by the human cognitive process of "perceive", "reason", and "correspond". Our evaluation shows the state-of-the-art models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro) still fall far behind humans, with a gap of over 54.65% in overall accuracy, exposing a challenge in transitioning from coarse-grained judgement to fine-grained coordinate prediction. To address this problem, we construct CrossPoint-378K, a dataset with 378K question-answering pairs across 900 scenes, focused on actionable affordance regions that better reflect real-world manipulation and interaction scenarios. Furthermore, we propose CroPond that trained on the CrossPoint-378K dataset. Our CroPond achieves state-of-the-art performance on CrossPoint-Bench, surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 39.7% accuracy, which offers a foundation for advancing future work on cross-view correspondence. The benchmark, dataset, and model are publicly available at https://github.com/WangYipu2002/CrossPoint.</p></details> |  |

Yet while model jailbreaks have drawn significant attention, the broader system stack of embodied intelligence remains largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first holistic security analysis of the Unitree Go2 platform and uncover ten cross layer vulnerabilities the "Ten Sins of Embodied AI Security." Using BLE sniffing, traffic interception, APK reverse engineering, cloud API testing, and hardware probing, we identify systemic weaknesses across three architectural layers: wireless provisioning, core modules, and external interfaces. These include hard coded keys, predictable handshake tokens, WiFi credential leakage, missing TLS validation, static SSH password, multilingual safety bypass behavior, insecure local relay channels, weak binding logic, and unrestricted firmware access. Together, they allow adversaries to hijack devices, inject arbitrary commands, extract sensitive information, or gain full physical control.Our findings show that securing embodied AI requires far more than aligning the model itself. We conclude with system level lessons learned and recommendations for building embodied platforms that remain robust across their entire software hardware ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

Both components employ modular 3D-printed finger designs, achieving ultra-low manufacturing costs while maintaining full actuation capabilities. Departing from conventional tendon-driven or underactuated approaches, our electromechanical system integrates independent joint motors across all 23 DoF, ensuring complete state observability and accurate kinematic modeling. This full-actuation architecture enables precise bidirectional kinematic calculations, substantially enhancing kinematic retargeting fidelity between the exoskeleton and robotic hand. The proposed system bridges the cost-performance gap in dexterous manipulation research, providing an accessible platform for acquiring high-quality demonstration data to advance embodied AI and dexterous robotic skill transfer learning.</p></details> |  |

However, current text- or image-driven 3D scene generation methods mainly focus on large-scale scenes, struggling to capture the high-density layouts and complex spatial relations that characterize tabletop scenes. To address these challenges, we propose TabletopGen, a training-free, fully automatic framework that generates diverse, instance-level interactive 3D tabletop scenes. TabletopGen accepts a reference image as input, which can be synthesized by a text-to-image model to enhance scene diversity. We then perform instance segmentation and completion on the reference to obtain per-instance images. Each instance is reconstructed into a 3D model followed by canonical coordinate alignment. The aligned 3D models then undergo pose and scale estimation before being assembled into a collision-free, simulation-ready tabletop scene. A key component of our framework is a novel pose and scale alignment approach that decouples the complex spatial reasoning into two stages: a Differentiable Rotation Optimizer for precise rotation recovery and a Top-view Spatial Alignment mechanism for robust translation and scale estimation, enabling accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D reference. Extensive experiments and user studies show that TabletopGen achieves state-of-the-art performance, markedly surpassing existing methods in visual fidelity, layout accuracy, and physical plausibility, capable of generating realistic tabletop scenes with rich stylistic and spatial diversity.

However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.

However, existing approaches to 4D semantic field construction primarily rely on scene-specific Gaussian splatting, which requires per-scene optimization, exhibits limited generalization, and is difficult to scale to real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose 4DLangVGGT, the first Transformer-based feed-forward unified framework for 4D language grounding, that jointly integrates geometric perception and language alignment within a single architecture. 4DLangVGGT has two key components: the 4D Visual Geometry Transformer, StreamVGGT, which captures spatio-temporal geometric representations of dynamic scenes; and the Semantic Bridging Decoder (SBD), which projects geometry-aware features into a language-aligned semantic space, thereby enhancing semantic interpretability while preserving structural fidelity. Unlike prior methods that depend on costly per-scene optimization, 4DLangVGGT can be jointly trained across multiple dynamic scenes and directly applied during inference, achieving both deployment efficiency and strong generalization. This design significantly improves the practicality of large-scale deployment and establishes a new paradigm for open-vocabulary 4D scene understanding. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D datasets demonstrate that our approach not only generalizes effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 2% gains under per-scene training and 1% improvements under multi-scene training.

However, progress in both Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and world models is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse training data. A promising solution is to "robotize" web-scale human videos, which has been proven effective for policy training. However, these solutions mainly "overlay" robot arms to egocentric videos, which cannot handle complex full-body motions and scene occlusions in third-person videos, making them unsuitable for robotizing humans. To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Humanoid, a generative video editing approach that adapts the powerful Wan 2.2 model into a video-to-video structure and finetunes it for the human-to-humanoid translation task. This finetuning requires paired human-humanoid videos, so we designed a scalable data creation pipeline, turning community assets into 17+ hours of paired synthetic videos using Unreal Engine. We then apply our trained model to 60 hours of the Ego-Exo4D videos, generating and releasing a new large-scale dataset of over 3.6 million "robotized" humanoid video frames. Quantitative analysis and user studies confirm our method's superiority over existing baselines: 69% of users rated it best for motion consistency, and 62.1% for embodiment correctness.</p></details> |  |

Existing autoregressive models suffer from content drift, where object identity and scene semantics degrade over time. To address this challenge, we introduce EgoLCD, an end-to-end framework for egocentric long-context video generation that treats long video synthesis as a problem of efficient and stable memory management. EgoLCD combines a Long-Term Sparse KV Cache for stable global context with an attention-based short-term memory, extended by LoRA for local adaptation. A Memory Regulation Loss enforces consistent memory usage, and Structured Narrative Prompting provides explicit temporal guidance. Extensive experiments on the EgoVid-5M benchmark demonstrate that EgoLCD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both perceptual quality and temporal consistency, effectively mitigating generative forgetting and representing a significant step toward building scalable world models for embodied AI.

These models have shown strong potential in generalization and reasoning, but achieving reliable and responsible robotic behavior in real-world settings remains an open challenge. In high-stakes environments, robotic agents must go beyond basic task execution to perform risk-aware reasoning, moral decision-making, and physically grounded planning. We introduce ResponsibleRobotBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate and accelerate progress in responsible robotic manipulation from simulation to real world. This benchmark consists of 23 multi-stage tasks spanning diverse risk types, including electrical, chemical, and human-related hazards, and varying levels of physical and planning complexity. These tasks require agents to detect and mitigate risks, reason about safety, plan sequences of actions, and engage human assistance when necessary. Our benchmark includes a general-purpose evaluation framework that supports multimodal model-based agents with various action representation modalities. The framework integrates visual perception, context learning, prompt construction, hazard detection, reasoning and planning, and physical execution. It also provides a rich multimodal dataset, supports reproducible experiments, and includes standardized metrics such as success rate, safety rate, and safe success rate. Through extensive experimental setups, ResponsibleRobotBench enables analysis across risk categories, task types, and agent configurations. By emphasizing physical reliability, generalization, and safety in decision-making, this benchmark provides a foundation for advancing the development of trustworthy, real-world responsible dexterous robotic systems. https://sites.google.com/view/responsible-robotbench</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://sites.google.com/view/responsible-robotbench</p></details> |

Richer rewards computed from the reasoning tokens can improve learning significantly by providing more fine-grained guidance. However, it is challenging to compute more informative rewards in MMRL beyond those based on outcomes since different samples may require different scoring functions and teacher models may provide noisy reward signals too. In this paper, we introduce the Argos (Agentic Reward for Grounded & Objective Scoring), a principled reward agent to train multimodal reasoning models for agentic tasks. For each sample, Argos selects from a pool of teacher-model derived and rule-based scoring functions to simultaneously evaluate: (i) final response accuracy, (ii) spatiotemporal localization of referred entities and actions, and (iii) the quality of the reasoning process. We find that by leveraging our agentic verifier across both SFT data curation and RL training, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple agentic tasks such as spatial reasoning, visual hallucination as well as robotics and embodied AI benchmarks. Critically, we demonstrate that just relying on SFT post-training on highly curated reasoning data is insufficient, as agents invariably collapse to ungrounded solutions during RL without our online verification. We also show that our agentic verifier can help to reduce reward-hacking in MMRL. Finally, we also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of Argos through the concept of pareto-optimality.</p></details> |  |

However, most affordance learning methods focus solely on "how" objects can be used while neglecting the "what" and "where" aspects. Other affordance detection methods treat object detection and affordance learning as two independent tasks, lacking effective interaction and real-time capability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce YOLO Affordance (YOLOA), a real-time affordance detection model that jointly handles these two tasks via a large language model (LLM) adapter. Specifically, YOLOA employs a lightweight detector consisting of object detection and affordance learning branches refined through the LLM Adapter. During training, the LLM Adapter interacts with object and affordance preliminary predictions to refine both branches by generating more accurate class priors, box offsets, and affordance gates. Experiments on our relabeled ADG-Det and IIT-Heat benchmarks demonstrate that YOLOA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (52.8 / 73.1 mAP on ADG-Det / IIT-Heat) while maintaining real-time performance (up to 89.77 FPS, and up to 846.24 FPS for the lightweight variant). This indicates that YOLOA achieves an excellent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, conference</p></details> |

Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a "hard-to-easy" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion. Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 19 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, existing VLA models, often built upon Vision-Language Models (VLMs), typically process dense visual inputs independently at each timestep. This approach implicitly models the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, this history-agnostic design is suboptimal for effective visual token processing in dynamic sequential decision-making, as it fails to leverage the context of history. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem from a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) perspective and propose a novel framework named AVA-VLA. Inspired by the POMDP that the action generation should be conditioned on the belief state. AVA-VLA introduces Active Visual Attention (AVA) to dynamically modulate visual processing. It achieves this by leveraging the recurrent state, which is a neural approximation of the agent's belief state derived from the previous decision step. Specifically, the AVA module uses the recurrent state to compute the soft weights to actively process task-relevant visual tokens based on its historical context. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AVA-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across popular robotic benchmarks, including LIBERO and CALVIN. Furthermore, real-world deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the framework's practical applicability and robust sim-to-real transferability.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

We introduce SPARK, a framework for reconstructing physically consistent, kinematic part-level articulated objects from a single RGB image. Given an input image, we first leverage VLMs to extract coarse URDF parameters and generate part-level reference images. We then integrate the part-image guidance and the inferred structure graph into a generative diffusion transformer to synthesize consistent part and complete shapes of articulated objects. To further refine the URDF parameters, we incorporate differentiable forward kinematics and differentiable rendering to optimize joint types, axes, and origins under VLM-generated open-state supervision. Extensive experiments show that SPARK produces high-quality, simulation-ready articulated assets across diverse categories, enabling downstream applications such as robotic manipulation and interaction modeling.

| **[Vision to Geometry: 3D Spatial Memory for Sequential Embodied MLLM Reasoning and Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02458v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing research on indoor embodied tasks typically requires agents to actively explore unknown environments and reason about the scene to achieve a specific goal. However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments verify that 3DSPMR achieves substantial performance gains on both sequential EQA and EMN tasks.</p></details> |  |

Unlike systems requiring depth sensors and offline calibration, KM-ViPE operates directly on raw RGB streams, making it ideal for ego-centric applications and harvesting internet-scale video data for training. KM-ViPE tightly couples DINO visual features with geometric constraints through a high-level features based adaptive robust kernel that handles both moving objects and movable static objects (e.g., moving furniture in ego-centric views). The system performs simultaneous online localization and open-vocabulary semantic mapping by fusing geometric and deep visual features aligned with language embeddings. Our results are competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, while existing solutions either operate offline, need depth data and/or odometry estimation, or lack dynamic scene robustness. KM-ViPE benefits from internet-scale training and uniquely combines online operation, uncalibrated monocular input, and robust handling of dynamic scenes, which makes it a good fit for autonomous robotics and AR/VR applications and advances practical spatial intelligence capabilities for embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[S$^2$-MLLM: Boosting Spatial Reasoning Capability of MLLMs for 3D Visual Grounding with Structural Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01223v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) focuses on locating objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions, serving as a fundamental task for embodied AI and robotics. Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have motivated research into extending them to 3DVG. However, MLLMs primarily process 2D visual inputs and struggle with understanding 3D spatial structure of scenes solely from these limited perspectives. Existing methods mainly utilize viewpoint-dependent rendering of reconstructed point clouds to provide explicit structural guidance for MLLMs in 3DVG tasks, leading to inefficiency and limited spatial reasoning. To address this issue, we propose S$^2$-MLLM, an efficient framework that enhances spatial reasoning in MLLMs through implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce a spatial guidance strategy that leverages the structure awareness of feed-forward 3D reconstruction. By acquiring 3D structural understanding during training, our model can implicitly reason about 3D scenes without relying on inefficient point cloud reconstruction. Moreover, we propose a structure-enhanced module (SE), which first employs intra-view and inter-view attention mechanisms to capture dependencies within views and correspondences across views. The module further integrates multi-level position encoding to associate visual representations with spatial positions and viewpoint information, enabling more accurate structural understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S$^2$-MLLM unifies superior performance, generalization, and efficiency, achieving significant performance over existing methods across the ScanRefer, Nr3D, and Sr3D datasets. Code will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

In this work, we present GigaWorld-0, a unified world model framework designed explicitly as a data engine for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) learning. GigaWorld-0 integrates two synergistic components: GigaWorld-0-Video, which leverages large-scale video generation to produce diverse, texture-rich, and temporally coherent embodied sequences under fine-grained control of appearance, camera viewpoint, and action semantics; and GigaWorld-0-3D, which combines 3D generative modeling, 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, physically differentiable system identification, and executable motion planning to ensure geometric consistency and physical realism. Their joint optimization enables the scalable synthesis of embodied interaction data that is visually compelling, spatially coherent, physically plausible, and instruction-aligned. Training at scale is made feasible through our efficient GigaTrain framework, which exploits FP8-precision and sparse attention to drastically reduce memory and compute requirements. We conduct comprehensive evaluations showing that GigaWorld-0 generates high-quality, diverse, and controllable data across multiple dimensions. Critically, VLA model (e.g., GigaBrain-0) trained on GigaWorld-0-generated data achieve strong real-world performance, significantly improving generalization and task success on physical robots without any real-world interaction during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://giga-world-0.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[EQ-Negotiator: Dynamic Emotional Personas Empower Small Language Models for Edge-Deployable Credit Negotiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03370v2)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in automated negotiation has set a high performance benchmark, but their computational cost and data privacy requirements render them unsuitable for many privacy-sensitive, on-device applications such as mobile assistants, embodied AI agents or private client interactions. While small language models (SLMs) offer a practical alternative, they suffer from a significant performance gap compared to LLMs in playing emotionally charged complex personas, especially for credit negotiation. This paper introduces EQ-Negotiator, a novel framework that bridges this capability gap using emotional personas. Its core is a reasoning system that integrates game theory with a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) to learn and track debtor emotional states online, without pre-training. This allows EQ-Negotiator to equip SLMs with the strategic intelligence to counter manipulation while de-escalating conflict and upholding ethical standards. Through extensive agent-to-agent simulations across diverse credit negotiation scenarios, including adversarial debtor strategies like cheating, threatening, and playing the victim, we show that a 7B parameter language model with EQ-Negotiator achieves better debt recovery and negotiation efficiency than baseline LLMs more than 10 times its size. This work advances persona modeling from descriptive character profiles to dynamic emotional architectures that operate within privacy constraints. Besides, this paper establishes that strategic emotional intelligence, not raw model scale, is the critical factor for success in automated negotiation, paving the way for effective, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI negotiators that can operate on the edge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asset-Driven Sematic Reconstruction of Dynamic Scene with Multi-Human-Object Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00547v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world human-built environments are highly dynamic, involving multiple humans and their complex interactions with surrounding objects. While 3D geometry modeling of such scenes is crucial for applications like AR/VR, gaming, and embodied AI, it remains underexplored due to challenges like diverse motion patterns and frequent occlusions. Beyond novel view rendering, 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has demonstrated remarkable progress in producing detailed, high-quality surface geometry with fast optimization of the underlying structure. However, very few GS-based methods address multihuman, multiobject scenarios, primarily due to the above-mentioned inherent challenges. In a monocular setup, these challenges are further amplified, as maintaining structural consistency under severe occlusion becomes difficult when the scene is optimized solely based on GS-based rendering loss. To tackle the challenges of such a multihuman, multiobject dynamic scene, we propose a hybrid approach that effectively combines the advantages of 1) 3D generative models for generating high-fidelity meshes of the scene elements, 2) Semantic-aware deformation, \ie rigid transformation of the rigid objects and LBS-based deformation of the humans, and mapping of the deformed high-fidelity meshes in the dynamic scene, and 3) GS-based optimization of the individual elements for further refining their alignments in the scene. Such a hybrid approach helps maintain the object structures even under severe occlusion and can produce multiview and temporally consistent geometry. We choose HOI-M3 for evaluation, as, to the best of our knowledge, this is the only dataset featuring multihuman, multiobject interactions in a dynamic scene. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method in producing better surface reconstruction of such scenes.</p></details> |  |

Early approaches struggle to generalize due to reliance on specialized models trained on curated small datasets. While recent advancements in large-scale 3D foundation models have significantly enhanced instance-level generation, coherent scene generation remains a challenge, where performance is limited by inaccurate per-object pose estimations and spatial inconsistency. To this end, this paper introduces CC-FMO, a zero-shot, camera-conditioned pipeline for single-image to 3D scene generation that jointly conforms to the object layout in input image and preserves instance fidelity. CC-FMO employs a hybrid instance generator that combines semantics-aware vector-set representation with detail-rich structured latent representation, yielding object geometries that are both semantically plausible and high-quality. Furthermore, CC-FMO enables the application of foundational pose estimation models in the scene generation task via a simple yet effective camera-conditioned scale-solving algorithm, to enforce scene-level coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CC-FMO consistently generates high-fidelity camera-aligned compositional scenes, outperforming all state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

World models serve as internal simulators that capture environment dynamics, enabling forward and counterfactual rollouts to support perception, prediction, and decision making. This survey presents a unified framework for world models in embodied AI. Specifically, we formalize the problem setting and learning objectives, and propose a three-axis taxonomy encompassing: (1) Functionality, Decision-Coupled vs. General-Purpose; (2) Temporal Modeling, Sequential Simulation and Inference vs. Global Difference Prediction; (3) Spatial Representation, Global Latent Vector, Token Feature Sequence, Spatial Latent Grid, and Decomposed Rendering Representation. We systematize data resources and metrics across robotics, autonomous driving, and general video settings, covering pixel prediction quality, state-level understanding, and task performance. Furthermore, we offer a quantitative comparison of state-of-the-art models and distill key open challenges, including the scarcity of unified datasets and the need for evaluation metrics that assess physical consistency over pixel fidelity, the trade-off between model performance and the computational efficiency required for real-time control, and the core modeling difficulty of achieving long-horizon temporal consistency while mitigating error accumulation.

Existing 3D generation primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models, the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we propose \textbf{PhysX-3D}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material, affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models, which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2) Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research in generative physical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025, Spotlight Project page: https://physx-3d.github.io/</p></details> |

High-level intentions, such as affordance, define the goal, while coordinated balance, contact, and manipulation can emerge naturally from underlying physical and motor priors. Scaling such priors is key to enabling humanoids to compose and generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse contexts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body coordination. To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects. We further demonstrate its effectiveness for user-interactive control and its potential for real robot deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Webpa...</summary><p>Webpage: https://sirui-xu.github.io/InterPrior/</p></details> |
| **[V-Retrver: Evidence-Driven Agentic Reasoning for Universal Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06034v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently been applied to universal multimodal retrieval, where Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves candidate reranking. However, existing approaches remain largely language-driven, relying on static visual encodings and lacking the ability to actively verify fine-grained visual evidence, which often leads to speculative reasoning in visually ambiguous cases. We propose V-Retrver, an evidence-driven retrieval framework that reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection. V-Retrver enables an MLLM to selectively acquire visual evidence during reasoning via external visual tools, performing a multimodal interleaved reasoning process that alternates between hypothesis generation and targeted visual verification.To train such an evidence-gathering retrieval agent, we adopt a curriculum-based learning strategy combining supervised reasoning activation, rejection-based refinement, and reinforcement learning with an evidence-aligned objective. Experiments across multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy (with 23.0% improvements on average), perception-driven reasoning reliability, and generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can vision language models learn intuitive physics from interaction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06033v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision language models do not have good intuitions about the physical world. Recent work has shown that supervised fine-tuning can improve model performance on simple physical tasks. However, fine-tuned models do not appear to learn robust physical rules that can generalize to new contexts. Based on research in cognitive science, we hypothesize that models need to interact with an environment to properly learn its physical dynamics. We train models that learn through interaction with the environment using reinforcement learning. While learning from interaction allows models to improve their within-task performance, it fails to produce models with generalizable physical intuitions. We find that models trained on one task do not reliably generalize to related tasks, even if the tasks share visual statistics and physical principles, and regardless of whether the models are trained through interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Query-Aware Budget-Tier Routing for Runtime Agent Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06025v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond a single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard query-critical information. Although runtime memory utilization is a natural alternative, prior work often incurs substantial overhead and offers limited explicit control over the performance-cost trade-off. In this work, we present \textbf{BudgetMem}, a runtime agent memory framework for explicit, query-aware performance-cost control. BudgetMem structures memory processing as a set of memory modules, each offered in three budget tiers (i.e., \textsc{Low}/\textsc{Mid}/\textsc{High}). A lightweight router performs budget-tier routing across modules to balance task performance and memory construction cost, which is implemented as a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning. Using BudgetMem as a unified testbed, we study three complementary strategies for realizing budget tiers: implementation (method complexity), reasoning (inference behavior), and capacity (module model size). Across LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA, BudgetMem surpasses strong baselines when performance is prioritized (i.e., high-budget setting), and delivers better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budgets. Moreover, our analysis disentangles the strengths and weaknesses of different tiering strategies, clarifying when each axis delivers the most favorable trade-offs under varying budget regimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/ViktorAxelsen/BudgetMem</p></details> |
| **[On Computation and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05999v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How does the amount of compute available to a reinforcement learning (RL) policy affect its learning? Can policies using a fixed amount of parameters, still benefit from additional compute? The standard RL framework does not provide a language to answer these questions formally. Empirically, deep RL policies are often parameterized as neural networks with static architectures, conflating the amount of compute and the number of parameters. In this paper, we formalize compute bounded policies and prove that policies which use more compute can solve problems and generalize to longer-horizon tasks that are outside the scope of policies with less compute. Building on prior work in algorithmic learning and model-free planning, we propose a minimal architecture that can use a variable amount of compute. Our experiments complement our theory. On a set 31 different tasks spanning online and offline RL, we show that $(1)$ this architecture achieves stronger performance simply by using more compute, and $(2)$ stronger generalization on longer-horizon test tasks compared to standard feedforward networks or deep residual network using up to 5 times more parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisRefiner: Learning from Visual Differences for Screenshot-to-Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05998v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Screenshot-to-code generation aims to translate user interface screenshots into executable frontend code that faithfully reproduces the target layout and style. Existing multimodal large language models perform this mapping directly from screenshots but are trained without observing the visual outcomes of their generated code. In contrast, human developers iteratively render their implementation, compare it with the design, and learn how visual differences relate to code changes. Inspired by this process, we propose VisRefiner, a training framework that enables models to learn from visual differences between rendered predictions and reference designs. We construct difference-aligned supervision that associates visual discrepancies with corresponding code edits, allowing the model to understand how appearance variations arise from implementation changes. Building on this, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage for self-refinement, where the model improves its generated code by observing both the rendered output and the target design, identifying their visual differences, and updating the code accordingly. Experiments show that VisRefiner substantially improves single-step generation quality and layout fidelity, while also endowing models with strong self-refinement ability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of learning from visual differences for advancing screenshot-to-code generation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the informed asymmetric actor-critic framework, allowing the critic to be conditioned on arbitrary state-dependent privileged signals without requiring access to the full state. We show that any such privileged signal yields unbiased policy gradient estimates, substantially expanding the set of admissible privileged information. This raises the problem of selecting the most adequate privileged information in order to improve learning. For this purpose, we propose two novel informativeness criteria: a dependence-based test that can be applied prior to training, and a criterion based on improvements in value prediction accuracy that can be applied post-hoc. Empirical results on partially observable benchmark tasks and synthetic environments demonstrate that carefully selected privileged signals can match or outperform full-state asymmetric baselines while relying on strictly less state information.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 26 pages total, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Share: Selective Memory for Efficient Parallel Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05965v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic systems solve complex tasks by coordinating multiple agents that iteratively reason, invoke tools, and exchange intermediate results. To improve robustness and solution quality, recent approaches deploy multiple agent teams running in parallel to explore diverse reasoning trajectories. However, parallel execution comes at a significant computational cost: when different teams independently reason about similar sub-problems or execute analogous steps, they repeatedly perform substantial overlapping computation. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose Learning to Share (LTS), a learned shared-memory mechanism for parallel agentic frameworks that enables selective cross-team information reuse while controlling context growth. LTS introduces a global memory bank accessible to all teams and a lightweight controller that decides whether intermediate agent steps should be added to memory or not. The controller is trained using stepwise reinforcement learning with usage-aware credit assignment, allowing it to identify information that is globally useful across parallel executions. Experiments on the AssistantBench and GAIA benchmarks show that LTS significantly reduces overall runtime while matching or improving task performance compared to memory-free parallel baselines, demonstrating that learned memory admission is an effective strategy for improving the efficiency of parallel agentic systems.

| **[Learning to Discover at Test Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16175v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we use AI to discover a new state of the art for a scientific problem? Prior work in test-time scaling, such as AlphaEvolve, performs search by prompting a frozen LLM. We perform reinforcement learning at test time, so the LLM can continue to train, but now with experience specific to the test problem. This form of continual learning is quite special, because its goal is to produce one great solution rather than many good ones on average, and to solve this very problem rather than generalize to other problems. Therefore, our learning objective and search subroutine are designed to prioritize the most promising solutions. We call this method Test-Time Training to Discover (TTT-Discover). Following prior work, we focus on problems with continuous rewards. We report results for every problem we attempted, across mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, algorithm design, and biology. TTT-Discover sets the new state of the art in almost all of them: (i) Erdős' minimum overlap problem and an autocorrelation inequality; (ii) a GPUMode kernel competition (up to $2\times$ faster than prior art); (iii) past AtCoder algorithm competitions; and (iv) denoising problem in single-cell analysis. Our solutions are reviewed by experts or the organizers. All our results are achieved with an open model, OpenAI gpt-oss-120b, and can be reproduced with our publicly available code, in contrast to previous best results that required closed frontier models. Our test-time training runs are performed using Tinker, an API by Thinking Machines, with a cost of only a few hundred dollars per problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/test-time-training/discover</p></details> |

In this work, we extend this divergence-based perspective to general alignment settings, such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where only environmental rewards are available. Within this unified framework, we propose $f$-Group Relative Policy Optimization ($f$-GRPO), a class of on-policy reinforcement learning, and $f$-Hybrid Alignment Loss ($f$-HAL), a hybrid on/off policy objectives, for general LLM alignment based on variational representation of $f$-divergences. We provide theoretical guarantees that these classes of objectives improve the average reward after alignment. Empirically, we validate our framework on both RLVR (Math Reasoning) and PA tasks (Safety Alignment), demonstrating superior performance and flexibility compared to current methods.</p></details> |  |

While this approach has been adopted in training advanced LLMs such as Kimi K1.5/K2, the ideal closed-form PMD updates require reliable partition function estimation, a significant challenge when working with limited rollouts in the vast action spaces of LLMs. We investigate a practical algorithm, termed PMD-mean, that approximates the log-partition term with the mean reward under the sampling policy and performs regression in log-policy space. Specifically, we characterize the population solution of PMD-mean and demonstrate that it implicitly optimizes mirror descent subproblems with an adaptive mixed KL--$χ^2$ regularizer. This additional $χ^2$ regularization constrains large probability changes, producing more conservative updates when expected rewards are low and enhancing robustness against finite-sample estimation errors. Experiments on math reasoning tasks show that PMD-mean achieves superior performance with improved stability and time efficiency. These findings deepen our understanding of PMD-mean and illuminate pathways toward principled improvements in RL algorithms for LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/horizon-rl/OpenKimi.</p></details> |  |

An Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent is implemented in classical, full quantum, and hybrid variants, integrating transformer architectures to capture the relationships between vehicles, clients, and the depot through self- and cross-attention mechanisms. The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies. However, quantum-enhanced models outperform the classical baseline and produce more robust route organization, with the hybrid architecture achieving the best overall performance across distance, compactness, and route overlap. In addition to quantitative improvements, qualitative visualizations reveal that quantum-based models generate more structured and coherent routing solutions. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning models for addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems such as the CVRP.</p></details> | 22 pages, 12 figures |

However, they are prone to faithfulness hallucinations, especially in intermediate reasoning steps. Existing mitigation methods based on online reinforcement learning rely on outcome-based rewards or coarse-grained CoT evaluation, which can inadvertently reinforce unfaithful reasoning when the final answer is correct. To address these limitations, we propose Faithfulness-Aware Step-Level Reinforcement Learning (FaithRL), introducing step-level supervision via explicit faithfulness rewards from a process reward model, together with an implicit truncated resampling strategy that generates contrastive signals from faithful prefixes. Experiments across multiple SRMs and Open-Book QA benchmarks demonstrate that FaithRL consistently reduces hallucinations in both the CoT and final answers, leading to more faithful and reliable reasoning.

| **[Residual Reinforcement Learning for Waste-Container Lifting Using Large-Scale Cranes with Underactuated Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05895v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the container lifting phase of a waste-container recycling task in urban environments, performed by a hydraulic loader crane equipped with an underactuated discharge unit, and proposes a residual reinforcement learning (RRL) approach that combines a nominal Cartesian controller with a learned residual policy. All experiments are conducted in simulation, where the task is characterized by tight geometric tolerances between the discharge-unit hooks and the container rings relative to the overall crane scale, making precise trajectory tracking and swing suppression essential. The nominal controller uses admittance control for trajectory tracking and pendulum-aware swing damping, followed by damped least-squares inverse kinematics with a nullspace posture term to generate joint velocity commands. A PPO-trained residual policy in Isaac Lab compensates for unmodeled dynamics and parameter variations, improving precision and robustness without requiring end-to-end learning from scratch. We further employ randomized episode initialization and domain randomization over payload properties, actuator gains, and passive joint parameters to enhance generalization. Simulation results demonstrate improved tracking accuracy, reduced oscillations, and higher lifting success rates compared to the nominal controller alone.</p></details> | 12 pages |

While reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is effective at improving LLMs to be generally more helpful and fluent, it does not account for variability across users, as it models the entire user population with a single reward model, meaning it assumes that everyone's preferences are the same. We present a novel framework, Preference Learning Using Summarization (PLUS), that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to learn to produce text-based summaries of each user's preferences, characteristics, and past conversations. These summaries condition the reward model, enabling it to make personalized predictions about the types of responses valued by each user. Both the user-summarization model and reward model are trained simultaneously, creating an online co-adaptation loop. We show that in contrast to the standard Bradley-Terry model, summaries produced by PLUS capture diverse aspects of user preferences, achieving a 11-77/% improvement in reward model accuracy. Key strengths of PLUS are: (1) robust performance with new users and conversation topics, achieving a 25\% improvement over the best personalized reward model technique used for RLHF; (2) zero-shot personalization with state-of-the-art proprietary models like GPT-4 (e.g., PLUS-summary-conditioned responses achieved a 72\% win rate compared to 28% for default GPT-4o); (3) learning from flexible user contexts beyond preference labels, and (4) interpretable representation of users, enabling greater transparency and user control in pluralistic LLM alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages for main text, 10 pages for appendix</p></details> |
| **[DFPO: Scaling Value Modeling via Distributional Flow towards Robust and Generalizable LLM Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05890v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training reinforcement learning (RL) systems in real-world environments remains challenging due to noisy supervision and poor out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, especially in LLM post-training. Recent distributional RL methods improve robustness by modeling values with multiple quantile points, but they still learn each quantile independently as a scalar. This results in rough-grained value representations that lack fine-grained conditioning on state information, struggling under complex and OOD conditions. We propose DFPO (Distributional Value Flow Policy Optimization with Conditional Risk and Consistency Control), a robust distributional RL framework that models values as continuous flows across time steps. By scaling value modeling through learning of a value flow field instead of isolated quantile predictions, DFPO captures richer state information for more accurate advantage estimation. To stabilize training under noisy feedback, DFPO further integrates conditional risk control and consistency constraints along value flow trajectories. Experiments on dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific tasks show that DFPO outperforms PPO, FlowRL, and other robust baselines under noisy supervision, achieving improved training stability and generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dr. Kernel: Reinforcement Learning Done Right for Triton Kernel Generations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05885v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality kernel is critical for scalable AI systems, and enabling LLMs to generate such code would advance AI development. However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM, we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO. To solve this, we propose Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out (TRLOO) to provide unbiased advantage estimation for multi-turn RL. To alleviate lazy optimization, we incorporate mismatch correction for training stability and introduce Profiling-based Rewards (PR) and Profiling-based Rejection Sampling (PRS) to overcome the issue. The trained model, Dr.Kernel-14B, reaches performance competitive with Claude-4.5-Sonnet in Kernelbench. Finally, we study sequential test-time scaling for Dr.Kernel-14B. On the KernelBench Level-2 subset, 31.6% of the generated kernels achieve at least a 1.2x speedup over the Torch reference, surpassing Claude-4.5-Sonnet (26.7%) and GPT-5 (28.6%). When selecting the best candidate across all turns, this 1.2x speedup rate further increases to 47.8%.

| **[Prompt Augmentation Scales up GRPO Training on Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03190v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning algorithms such as group-relative policy optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated strong potential for improving the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, prior work has consistently observed an entropy collapse phenomenon during reinforcement post-training, characterized by a monotonic decrease in policy entropy that ultimately leads to training instability and collapse. As a result, most existing approaches restrict training to short horizons (typically 5-20 epochs), limiting sustained exploration and hindering further policy improvement. In addition, nearly all prior work relies on a single, fixed reasoning prompt or template during training. In this work, we introduce prompt augmentation, a training strategy that instructs the model to generate reasoning traces under diverse templates and formats, thereby increasing rollout diversity. We show that, without a KL regularization term, prompt augmentation enables stable scaling of training duration under a fixed dataset and allows the model to tolerate low-entropy regimes without premature collapse. Empirically, a Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B model trained with prompt augmentation on the MATH Level 3-5 dataset achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 45.2 per-benchmark accuracy and 51.8 per-question accuracy on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, Minerva, and OlympiadBench. The code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/wenquanlu/prompt-augmentation-GRPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Enhanced Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: Applications of Newton's Laws in Financial Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01388v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), a subset of machine learning focused on sequential decision-making, has emerged as a powerful approach for tackling financial trading problems. In finance, DRL is commonly used either to generate discrete trade signals or to determine continuous portfolio allocations. In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework for portfolio optimization that incorporates Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) into several DRL algorithms. The approach replaces conventional multilayer perceptrons with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in both actor and critic components-utilizing learnable B-spline univariate functions to achieve parameter-efficient and more interpretable function approximation. During actor updates, we introduce a physics-informed regularization loss that promotes second-order temporal consistency between observed return dynamics and the action-induced portfolio adjustments. The proposed framework is evaluated across three equity markets-China, Vietnam, and the United States, covering both emerging and developed economies. Across all three markets, PIKAN-based agents consistently deliver higher cumulative and annualized returns, superior Sharpe and Calmar ratios, and more favorable drawdown characteristics compared to both standard DRL baselines and classical online portfolio-selection methods. This yields more stable training, higher Sharpe ratios, and superior performance compared to traditional DRL counterparts. The approach is particularly valuable in highly dynamic and noisy financial markets, where conventional DRL often suffers from instability and poor generalization.</p></details> |  |

However, its effectiveness is severely hindered by inefficient credit assignment in long-horizon tasks and repetitive errors across tasks due to the lack of experience transfer. To address these challenges, we propose UI-Mem, a novel framework that enhances GUI online RL with a Hierarchical Experience Memory. Unlike traditional replay buffers, our memory accumulates structured knowledge, including high-level workflows, subtask skills, and failure patterns. These experiences are stored as parameterized templates that enable cross-task and cross-application transfer. To effectively integrate memory guidance into online RL, we introduce Stratified Group Sampling, which injects varying levels of guidance across trajectories within each rollout group to maintain outcome diversity, driving the unguided policy toward internalizing guided behaviors. Furthermore, a Self-Evolving Loop continuously abstracts novel strategies and errors to keep the memory aligned with the agent's evolving policy. Experiments on online GUI benchmarks demonstrate that UI-Mem significantly outperforms traditional RL baselines and static reuse strategies, with strong generalization to unseen applications.

| **[Vision-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06749v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DeepSeek-R1-Zero has successfully demonstrated the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs purely through Reinforcement Learning (RL). Inspired by this breakthrough, we explore how RL can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capability of MLLMs. However, direct training with RL struggles to activate complex reasoning capabilities such as questioning and reflection in MLLMs, due to the absence of substantial high-quality multimodal reasoning data. To address this issue, we propose the reasoning MLLM, Vision-R1, to improve multimodal reasoning capability. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality multimodal CoT dataset without human annotations by leveraging an existing MLLM and DeepSeek-R1 through modality bridging and data filtering to obtain a 200K multimodal CoT dataset, Vision-R1-cold dataset. It serves as cold-start initialization data for Vision-R1. To mitigate the optimization challenges caused by overthinking after cold start, we propose Progressive Thinking Suppression Training (PTST) strategy and employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with the hard formatting result reward function to gradually refine the model's ability to learn correct and complex reasoning processes on a 10K multimodal math dataset. Comprehensive experiments show our model achieves an average improvement of $\sim$6% across various multimodal math reasoning benchmarks. Vision-R1-7B achieves a 73.5% accuracy on the widely used MathVista benchmark, which is only 0.4% lower than the leading reasoning model, OpenAI O1. Scaling up the amount of multimodal math data in the RL training, Vision-R1-32B and Vison-R1-72B achieves 76.4% and 78.2% MathVista benchmark scores, respectively.

While recent research has leveraged text-centric Chain-of-Thought reasoning to augment these capabilities, such approaches frequently suffer from representational mismatch and restricted by limited perceptual acuity. To address these limitations, we propose Weaver, a novel, end-to-end trainable multimodal reasoning agentic system. Weaver empowers its policy model to dynamically invoke diverse tools throughout the reasoning process, enabling progressive acquisition of crucial visual cues and construction of authentic multimodal reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, we integrate a reinforcement learning algorithm to allow the system to freely explore strategies for employing and combining these tools with trajectory-free data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system, Weaver, enhances performance on several complex video reasoning benchmarks, particularly those involving long videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[TKG-Thinker: Towards Dynamic Reasoning over Temporal Knowledge Graphs via Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05818v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) aims to answer time-sensitive questions by leveraging temporal knowledge bases. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in TKGQA, current prompting strategies constrain their efficacy in two primary ways. First, they are prone to reasoning hallucinations under complex temporal constraints. Second, static prompting limits model autonomy and generalization, as it lack optimization through dynamic interaction with temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) environments. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{TKG-Thinker}, a novel agent equipped with autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities for reasoning over TKGs. Specifically, TKG-Thinker performs in-depth temporal reasoning through dynamic multi-turn interactions with TKGs via a dual-training strategy. We first apply Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with chain-of thought data to instill core planning capabilities, followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that leverages multi-dimensional rewards to refine reasoning policies under intricate temporal constraints. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with three open-source LLMs show that TKG-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generalization across complex TKGQA settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Policy Gradient-Based Sequence-to-Sequence Method for Time Series Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09643v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequence-to-sequence architectures built upon recurrent neural networks have become a standard choice for multi-step-ahead time series prediction. In these models, the decoder produces future values conditioned on contextual inputs, typically either actual historical observations (ground truth) or previously generated predictions. During training, feeding ground-truth values helps stabilize learning but creates a mismatch between training and inference conditions, known as exposure bias, since such true values are inaccessible during real-world deployment. On the other hand, using the model's own outputs as inputs at test time often causes errors to compound rapidly across prediction steps. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce a new training paradigm grounded in reinforcement learning: a policy gradient-based method to learn an adaptive input selection strategy for sequence-to-sequence prediction models. Auxiliary models first synthesize plausible input candidates for the decoder, and a trainable policy network optimized via policy gradients dynamically chooses the most beneficial inputs to maximize long-term prediction performance. Empirical evaluations on diverse time series datasets confirm that our approach enhances both accuracy and stability in multi-step forecasting compared to conventional methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Diffusion Bridge Critics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05783v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods have demonstrated promising results in a wide range of continuous control tasks. However, existing works in this field focus on the application of diffusion policies while leaving the diffusion critics unexplored. In fact, since policy optimization fundamentally relies on the critic, accurate value estimation is far more important than policy expressiveness. Furthermore, given the stochasticity of most reinforcement learning tasks, it has been confirmed that the critic is more appropriately depicted with a distributional model. Motivated by these points, we propose a novel distributional RL method with Diffusion Bridge Critics (DBC). DBC directly models the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Q value. This allows us to accurately capture the value distribution and prevents it from collapsing into a trivial Gaussian distribution owing to the strong distribution-matching capability of the diffusion bridge. Moreover, we further derive an analytic integral formula to address discretization errors in DBC, which is essential in value estimation. To our knowledge, DBC is the first work to employ the diffusion bridge model as the critic. Notably, DBC is also a plug-and-play component and can be integrated into most existing RL frameworks. Experimental results on MuJoCo robot control benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DBC compared with previous distributional critic models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Domain Offline Policy Adaptation via Selective Transition Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05776v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It remains a critical challenge to adapt policies across domains with mismatched dynamics in reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we study cross-domain offline RL, where an offline dataset from another similar source domain can be accessed to enhance policy learning upon a target domain dataset. Directly merging the two datasets may lead to suboptimal performance due to potential dynamics mismatches. Existing approaches typically mitigate this issue through source domain transition filtering or reward modification, which, however, may lead to insufficient exploitation of the valuable source domain data. Instead, we propose to modify the source domain data into the target domain data. To that end, we leverage an inverse policy model and a reward model to correct the actions and rewards of source transitions, explicitly achieving alignment with the target dynamics. Since limited data may result in inaccurate model training, we further employ a forward dynamics model to retain corrected samples that better match the target dynamics than the original transitions. Consequently, we propose the Selective Transition Correction (STC) algorithm, which enables reliable usage of source domain data for policy adaptation. Experiments on various environments with dynamics shifts demonstrate that STC achieves superior performance against existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies. Scaling law validation across 8 to 256 GPUs demonstrates our method's excellent scalability under most conditions.</p></details> |  |

This capability is equally pivotal in long-context scenarios--such as long-dialogue understanding and structured data analysis, where the challenge extends beyond consuming tokens to performing rigorous deduction. While existing efforts focus on data synthesis or architectural changes, recent work points out that relying solely on sparse, outcome-only rewards yields limited gains, as such coarse signals are often insufficient to effectively guide the complex long-context reasoning. To address this, we propose LongR, a unified framework that enhances long-context performance by integrating a dynamic "Think-and-Read" mechanism, which interleaves reasoning with document consultation, with a contextual density reward based on relative information gain to quantify the utility of the relevant documents. Empirically, LongR achieves a 9% gain on LongBench v2 and consistent improvements on RULER and InfiniteBench, demonstrating robust efficiency in navigating extensive contexts. Furthermore, LongR consistently enhances performance across diverse RL algorithms (e.g., DAPO, GSPO). Finally, we conduct in-depth analyses to investigate the impact of reasoning chain length on efficiency and the model's robustness against distractors.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods heavily depend on human red-teamers and hand-crafted prompts, limiting their scalability and adaptability. We propose AutoInject, a reinforcement learning framework that generates universal, transferable adversarial suffixes while jointly optimizing for attack success and utility preservation on benign tasks. Our black-box method supports both query-based optimization and transfer attacks to unseen models and tasks. Using only a 1.5B parameter adversarial suffix generator, we successfully compromise frontier systems including GPT 5 Nano, Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Gemini 2.5 Flash on the AgentDojo benchmark, establishing a stronger baseline for automated prompt injection research.</p></details> |  |

While retrieved documents help address knowledge gaps, model-generated responses still suffer from hallucinations that contradict the retrieved information. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose a Reinforcement Learning framework enhanced with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification (RLFKV). Our method decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units and assesses the correctness of each unit to compute the fine-grained faithful reward. This reward offers more precise optimization signals, thereby improving alignment with the retrieved documents. Additionally, to prevent reward hacking (e.g., overly concise replies), we incorporate an informativeness reward that encourages the policy model to retain at least as many knowledge units as the base model. Experiments conducted on the public Financial Data Description (FDD) task and our newly proposed FDD-ANT dataset demonstrate consistent improvements, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

However, we identify a systemic pathology termed Recursive Space Contraction (RSC), an irreversible collapse driven by the combined dynamics of positive sharpening and negative squeezing, where the sampling probability of valid alternatives vanishes. While Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization aims to mitigate this, it imposes a rigid Shape Matching constraint that forces the policy to mimic the reference model's full density, creating a gradient conflict with the sharpening required for correctness. We propose Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), shifting the paradigm from global Shape Matching to Support Coverage. By defining a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support, APO permits aggressive sharpening for efficiency while selectively invoking a restorative force during error correction to prevent collapse. We theoretically derive that APO serves as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage, enabling an Elastic Recovery that re-inflates valid branches. Empirical evaluations on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, significantly improving Pass@1 while restoring the Pass@K diversity typically lost by standard policy gradient methods.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows, which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent reasoning process. To manage long-horizon interactions, we introduce an autonomous memory folding mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working, and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank, TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA, HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios.

Such issues prevail in autonomous robotics and video game simulations, notably for navigation tasks prone to topological or kinematic changes. To address these issues, we introduce HiSPO, a novel hierarchical framework designed specifically for continual learning in navigation settings from offline data. Our method leverages distinct policy subspaces of neural networks to enable flexible and efficient adaptation to new tasks while preserving existing knowledge. We demonstrate, through a careful experimental study, the effectiveness of our method in both classical MuJoCo maze environments and complex video game-like navigation simulations, showcasing competitive performances and satisfying adaptability with respect to classical continual learning metrics, in particular regarding the memory usage and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Among RLVR methods, GRPO and its variants have achieved strong empirical performance. Despite their success, we identify that they suffer from Gradient Misassignment in Positives and Gradient Domination in Negatives, which lead to inefficient and suboptimal policy updates. To address these issues, we propose Rewards as Labels (REAL), a novel framework that revisits verifiable rewards as categorical labels rather than scalar weights, thereby reformulating policy optimization as a classification problem. Building on this, we further introduce anchor logits to enhance policy learning. Our analysis reveals that REAL induces a monotonic and bounded gradient weighting, enabling balanced gradient allocation across rollouts and effectively mitigating the identified mismatches. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that REAL improves training stability and consistently outperforms GRPO and strong variants such as DAPO. On the 1.5B model, REAL improves average Pass@1 over DAPO by 6.7%. These gains further scale to 7B model, REAL continues to outperform DAPO and GSPO by 6.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Notably, even with a vanilla binary cross-entropy, REAL remains stable and exceeds DAPO by 4.5% on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

We show that in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), discrepancies between training and evaluation behavior induced by Batch Normalization lead to policy mismatch, distributional drift, and reward collapse. We propose Mode-Dependent Rectification (MDR), a lightweight dual-phase training procedure that stabilizes PPO under mode-dependent layers without architectural changes.

A key issue is the freezing robot problem, where the robot struggles to find safe motions and becomes stuck within the crowd. To address this, we propose HiCrowd, a hierarchical framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with model predictive control (MPC). HiCrowd leverages surrounding pedestrian motion as guidance, enabling the robot to align with compatible crowd flows. A high-level RL policy generates a follow point to align the robot with a suitable pedestrian group, while a low-level MPC safely tracks this guidance with short horizon planning. The method combines long-term crowd aware decision making with safe short-term execution. We evaluate HiCrowd against reactive and learning-based baselines in offline setting (replaying recorded human trajectories) and online setting (human trajectories are updated to react to the robot in simulation). Experiments on a real-world dataset and a synthetic crowd dataset show that our method outperforms in navigation efficiency and safety, while reducing freezing behaviors. Our results suggest that leveraging human motion as guidance, rather than treating humans solely as dynamic obstacles, provides a powerful principle for safe and efficient robot navigation in crowds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

While recently published contributions achieve high success rates in locomotion tasks, scarce attention has been devoted to the development of methods that enable to handle hardware faults that may occur during the locomotion process. However, in real-world settings, environmental disturbances or sudden occurrences of hardware faults might yield severe consequences. To address these issues, this paper presents TOLEBI (A faulT-tOlerant Learning framEwork for Bipedal locomotIon) that handles faults on the robot during operation. Specifically, joint locking, power loss and external disturbances are injected in simulation to learn fault-tolerant locomotion strategies. In addition to transferring the learned policy to the real robot via sim-to-real transfer, an online joint status module incorporated.

| **[Unveiling Implicit Advantage Symmetry: Why GRPO Struggles with Exploration and Difficulty Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05548v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly GRPO, has become the standard for eliciting LLM reasoning. However, its efficiency in exploration and difficulty adaptation remains an open challenge. In this work, we argue that these bottlenecks stem from an implicit advantage symmetry inherent in Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE). This symmetry induces two critical limitations: (i) at the group level, strict symmetry in weights between correct and incorrect trajectories leaves unsampled action logits unchanged, thereby hindering exploration of novel correct solution. (ii) at the sample level, the algorithm implicitly prioritizes medium-difficulty samples, remaining agnostic to the non-stationary demands of difficulty focus. Through controlled experiments, we reveal that this symmetric property is sub-optimal, yielding two pivotal insights: (i) asymmetrically suppressing the advantages of correct trajectories encourages essential exploration. (ii) learning efficiency is maximized by a curriculum-like transition-prioritizing simpler samples initially before gradually shifting to complex ones. Motivated by these findings, we propose Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE), which dynamically modulates exploration incentives and sample-difficulty focus. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that A-GRAE consistently improves GRPO and its variants across both LLMs and MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Framework for Rethinking Policy Divergence Measures in GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05494v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a critical paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Most existing RLVR methods, such as GRPO and its variants, ensure stable updates by constraining policy divergence through clipping likelihood ratios. This paper introduces a unified clipping framework that characterizes existing methods via a general notion of policy divergence, encompassing both likelihood ratios and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences and extending to alternative measures. The framework provides a principled foundation for systematically analyzing how different policy divergence measures affect exploration and performance. We further identify the KL3 estimator, a variance-reduced Monte Carlo estimator of the KL divergence, as a key policy divergence constraint. We theoretically demonstrate that the KL3-based constraint is mathematically equivalent to an asymmetric ratio-based clipping that reallocates probability mass toward high-confidence actions, promoting stronger exploration while retaining the simplicity of GRPO-style methods. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating the KL3 estimator into GRPO improves both training stability and final performance, highlighting the importance of principled policy divergence constraints in policy optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Log2Motion: Biomechanical Motion Synthesis from Touch Logs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21043v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Touch data from mobile devices are collected at scale but reveal little about the interactions that produce them. While biomechanical simulations can illuminate motor control processes, they have not yet been developed for touch interactions. To close this gap, we propose a novel computational problem: synthesizing plausible motion directly from logs. Our key insight is a reinforcement learning-driven musculoskeletal forward simulation that generates biomechanically plausible motion sequences consistent with events recorded in touch logs. We achieve this by integrating a software emulator into a physics simulator, allowing biomechanical models to manipulate real applications in real-time. Log2Motion produces rich syntheses of user movements from touch logs, including estimates of motion, speed, accuracy, and effort. We assess the plausibility of generated movements by comparing against human data from a motion capture study and prior findings, and demonstrate Log2Motion in a large-scale dataset. Biomechanical motion synthesis provides a new way to understand log data, illuminating the ergonomics and motor control underlying touch interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[RFS: Reinforcement Learning with Residual Flow Steering for Dexterous Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01789v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning has emerged as an effective approach for bootstrapping sequential decision-making in robotics, achieving strong performance even in high-dimensional dexterous manipulation tasks. Recent behavior cloning methods further leverage expressive generative models, such as diffusion models and flow matching, to represent multimodal action distributions. However, policies pretrained in this manner often exhibit limited generalization and require additional fine-tuning to achieve robust performance at deployment time. Such adaptation must preserve the global exploration benefits of pretraining while enabling rapid correction of local execution errors. We propose Residual Flow Steering(RFS), a data-efficient reinforcement learning framework for adapting pretrained generative policies. RFS steers a pretrained flow-matching policy by jointly optimizing a residual action and a latent noise distribution, enabling complementary forms of exploration: local refinement through residual corrections and global exploration through latent-space modulation. This design allows efficient adaptation while retaining the expressive structure of the pretrained policy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RFS on dexterous manipulation tasks, showing efficient fine-tuning in both simulation and real-world settings when adapting pretrained base policies.

| **[ALIVE: Awakening LLM Reasoning via Adversarial Learning and Instructive Verbal Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05472v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quest for expert-level reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hampered by a persistent \textit{reward bottleneck}: traditional reinforcement learning (RL) relies on scalar rewards that are \textbf{costly} to scale, \textbf{brittle} across domains, and \textbf{blind} to the underlying logic of a solution. This reliance on external, impoverished signals prevents models from developing a deep, self-contained understanding of reasoning principles. We introduce \textbf{ALIVE} (\emph{Adversarial Learning with Instructive Verbal Evaluation}), a hands-free alignment framework that moves beyond scalar reward optimization toward intrinsic reasoning acquisition. Grounded in the principle of \emph{Cognitive Synergy}, ALIVE unifies problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model to internalize the logic of correctness. By coupling adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback, ALIVE enables models to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, effectively transforming external critiques into an endogenous reasoning faculty. Empirical evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general logical inference benchmarks demonstrate that ALIVE consistently mitigates reward signal limitations. With identical data and compute, it achieves accuracy gains, markedly improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates. These results indicate that the reasoning trinity fosters a self-sustaining trajectory of capability growth, positioning ALIVE as a scalable foundation for general-purpose reasoning alignment without human-in-the-loop supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diversity or Precision? A Deep Dive into Next Token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22955v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The effectiveness of such RL training, however, depends critically on the exploration space defined by the pre-trained model's token-output distribution. In this paper, we revisit the standard cross-entropy loss, interpreting it as a specific instance of policy gradient optimization applied within a single-step episode. To systematically study how the pre-trained distribution shapes the exploration potential for subsequent RL, we propose a generalized pre-training objective that adapts on-policy RL principles to supervised learning. By framing next-token prediction as a stochastic decision process, we introduce a reward-shaping strategy that explicitly balances diversity and precision. Our method employs a positive reward scaling factor to control probability concentration on ground-truth tokens and a rank-aware mechanism that treats high-ranking and low-ranking negative tokens asymmetrically. This allows us to reshape the pre-trained token-output distribution and investigate how to provide a more favorable exploration space for RL, ultimately enhancing end-to-end reasoning performance. Contrary to the intuition that higher distribution entropy facilitates effective exploration, we find that imposing a precision-oriented prior yields a superior exploration space for RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoRA: Geometry-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation for RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09361v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is crucial for advancing large-scale reasoning models. However, existing parameter-efficient methods, such as PiSSA and MiLoRA, are designed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and do not account for the distinct optimization dynamics and geometric structures of RLVR. Applying these methods directly leads to spectral collapse and optimization instability, which severely limit model performance. Meanwhile, alternative approaches that leverage update sparsity encounter significant efficiency bottlenecks on modern hardware due to unstructured computations. To address these challenges, we propose GeoRA (Geometry-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation), which exploits the anisotropic and compressible nature of RL update subspaces. GeoRA initializes adapters by extracting principal directions via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) within a geometrically constrained subspace while freezing the residual components. This method preserves the pre-trained geometric structure and enables efficient GPU computation through dense operators. Experiments on Qwen and Llama demonstrate that GeoRA mitigates optimization bottlenecks caused by geometric misalignment. It consistently outperforms established low-rank baselines on key mathematical benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Moreover, GeoRA shows superior generalization and resilience to catastrophic forgetting in out-of-domain tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Are RL Hyperparameters Benign? A Study in Offline Goal-Conditioned RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05459v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperparameter sensitivity in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often accepted as unavoidable. However, it remains unclear whether it is intrinsic to the RL problem or exacerbated by specific training mechanisms. We investigate this question in offline goal-conditioned RL, where data distributions are fixed, and non-stationarity can be explicitly controlled via scheduled shifts in data quality. Additionally, we study varying data qualities under both stationary and non-stationary regimes, and cover two representative algorithms: HIQL (bootstrapped TD-learning) and QRL (quasimetric representation learning). Overall, we observe substantially greater robustness to changes in hyperparameter configurations than commonly reported for online RL, even under controlled non-stationarity. Once modest expert data is present ($\approx$ 20\%), QRL maintains broad, stable near-optimal regions, while HIQL exhibits sharp optima that drift significantly across training phases. To explain this divergence, we introduce an inter-goal gradient alignment diagnostic. We find that bootstrapped objectives exhibit stronger destructive gradient interference, which coincides directly with hyperparameter sensitivity. These results suggest that high sensitivity to changes in hyperparameter configurations during training is not inevitable in RL, but is amplified by the dynamics of bootstrapping, offering a pathway toward more robust algorithmic objective design.</p></details> | 27 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Preference-based Reinforcement Learning beyond Pairwise Comparisons: Benefits of Multiple Options](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18713v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study online preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) with the goal of improving sample efficiency. While a growing body of theoretical work has emerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning large language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise comparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024, Thekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and ranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even deteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information available. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the offered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of $\tilde{O}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}} \right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature dimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result shows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably, the bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm, which was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we establish a near-matching lower bound of $Ω\left( \frac{d}{K \sqrt{T}} \right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that explicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[DistillER: Knowledge Distillation in Entity Resolution with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05452v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Entity Resolution (ER) have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving strong performance but at the cost of substantial computational resources or high financial overhead. Existing LLM-based ER approaches operate either in unsupervised settings and rely on very large and costly models, or in supervised settings and require ground-truth annotations, leaving a critical gap between time efficiency and effectiveness. To make LLM-powered ER more practical, we investigate Knowledge Distillation (KD) as a means to transfer knowledge from large, effective models (Teachers) to smaller, more efficient models (Students) without requiring gold labels. We introduce DistillER, the first framework that systematically bridges this gap across three dimensions: (i) Data Selection, where we study strategies for identifying informative subsets of data; (ii) Knowledge Elicitation, where we compare single- and multi-teacher settings across LLMs and smaller language models (SLMs); and (iii) Distillation Algorithms, where we evaluate supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning approaches. Our experiments reveal that supervised fine-tuning of Students on noisy labels generated by LLM Teachers consistently outperforms alternative KD strategies, while also enabling high-quality explanation generation. Finally, we benchmark DistillER against established supervised and unsupervised ER methods based on LLMs and SLMs, demonstrating significant improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Dynamic Entropy Weighting, systematically define entropy-based weight ratios $\frac{H_{i,t}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n} H_{k,t}}$ and similar variants to redistribute rewards and get fine-grained rewards through two new algorithms: Group Token Policy Optimization (GTPO), which assigns an entropy-weighted reward to each token and synthesizes token-specific advantage function to drive the model toward optimal path, and the analogous algorithm Sequence-Level GRPO (GRPO-S), which extends this design to the sequence level and exhibits superior stability in long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rich-Media Re-Ranker: A User Satisfaction-Driven LLM Re-ranking Framework for Rich-Media Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05408v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Re-ranking plays a crucial role in modern information search systems by refining the ranking of initial search results to better satisfy user information needs. However, existing methods show two notable limitations in improving user search satisfaction: inadequate modeling of multifaceted user intents and neglect of rich side information such as visual perception signals. To address these challenges, we propose the Rich-Media Re-Ranker framework, which aims to enhance user search satisfaction through multi-dimensional and fine-grained modeling. Our approach begins with a Query Planner that analyzes the sequence of query refinements within a session to capture genuine search intents, decomposing the query into clear and complementary sub-queries to enable broader coverage of users' potential intents. Subsequently, moving beyond primary text content, we integrate richer side information of candidate results, including signals modeling visual content generated by the VLM-based evaluator. These comprehensive signals are then processed alongside carefully designed re-ranking principle that considers multiple facets, including content relevance and quality, information gain, information novelty, and the visual presentation of cover images. Then, the LLM-based re-ranker performs the holistic evaluation based on these principles and integrated signals. To enhance the scenario adaptability of the VLM-based evaluator and the LLM-based re-ranker, we further enhance their capabilities through multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, the proposed framework has been deployed in a large-scale industrial search system, yielding substantial improvements in online user engagement rates and satisfaction metrics.</p></details> |  |

Despite these achievements, their application to finance remains challenging, due to fragmented data sources, intransparent reasoning processes, and weak transferability to business applications. In response, we introduce Fin-R1, a reasoning LLM designed for financial scenarios. With a compact size of 7 billion parameters, Fin-R1 reduces deployment costs while addressing the aforementioned challenges. Its development follows a two-stage pipeline. First, we construct Fin-R1-Data, a high-quality financial dataset consisting of 60,091 chain-of-thought (CoT) samples, distilled and filtered from multiple authoritative benchmarks to ensure consistency and reliability. Second, we train Fin-R1 using Fin-R1-Data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by reinforcement learning (RL). This stage substantially improves the model's ability to solve complex financial reasoning tasks, yielding outputs that are both accurate and interpretable. Despite its relatively small parameter scale, Fin-R1 achieves competitive empirical performance across established financial benchmarks and demonstrates practical utility in compliance checking and robo-advisory. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/SUFE-AIFLM-Lab/Fin-R1, and has already attracted over 700 stars.</p></details> |  |

Intent-Driven Networks (IDNs) address this by translating high-level intents into optimization policies. Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance this process by understanding complex human instructions, enabling adaptive and intelligent automation. Given the rapid advancements in Generative AI (GenAI), a comprehensive survey of LLM-based IDN architectures in disaggregated Radio Access Network (RAN) environments is both timely and critical. This article provides such a survey, along with a case study on a selective State-Space Model (SSM)-enabled IDN architecture that integrates GenAI across three key stages: intent processing, intent validation, and intent execution. For the first time in the literature, we propose a hierarchical framework built on Mamba-SSM that introduces GenAI across all stages of the IDN pipeline. We further present a case study demonstrating that the proposed Mamba architecture significantly improves network performance through intelligent automation, surpassing existing IDN approaches. In a multi-cell 5G/6G scenario, the proposed architecture reduces quality of service drift by up to 70%, improves throughput by up to 80 Mbps, and lowers inference time to 60-70 ms, outperforming GenAI, reinforcement learning, and non-machine learning baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper submitted to IEEE for possible publication.

Classical experience replay treats all past observations uniformly and fails to account for their varying contributions to learning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Variance Reduction Experience Replay (VRER), a principled framework that selectively reuses informative samples to reduce variance in policy gradient estimation. VRER is algorithm-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with existing policy optimization methods, forming the basis of our sample-efficient off-policy algorithm, Policy Gradient with VRER (PG-VRER). Motivated by the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis of experience replay, we develop a novel framework that explicitly captures dependencies introduced by Markovian dynamics and behavior-policy interactions. Using this framework, we establish finite-time convergence guarantees for PG-VRER and reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off: reusing older experience increases bias but simultaneously reduces gradient variance. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate that VRER consistently accelerates policy learning and improves performance over state-of-the-art policy optimization algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2208.12341</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical framework that frames this challenge as an integrated skill planning & scheduling problem, going beyond purely sequential decision-making to support simultaneous skill invocation. Our approach is built upon a library of single-arm and bimanual primitive skills, each trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in GPU-accelerated simulation. We then train a Transformer-based planner on a dataset of skill compositions to act as a high-level scheduler, simultaneously predicting the discrete schedule of skills as well as their continuous parameters. We demonstrate that our method achieves higher success rates on complex, contact-rich tasks than end-to-end RL approaches and produces more efficient, coordinated behaviors than traditional sequential-only planners.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in generative models and procedural techniques have improved the realism of city generation, existing methods often struggle with high-fidelity asset creation, controllability, and manipulation. In this work, we introduce CityGenAgent, a natural language-driven framework for hierarchical procedural generation of high-quality 3D cities. Our approach decomposes city generation into two interpretable components, Block Program and Building Program. To ensure structural correctness and semantic alignment, we adopt a two-stage learning strategy: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We train BlockGen and BuildingGen to generate valid programs that adhere to schema constraints, including non-self-intersecting polygons and complete fields; (2) Reinforcement Learning (RL). We design Spatial Alignment Reward to enhance spatial reasoning ability and Visual Consistency Reward to bridge the gap between textual descriptions and the visual modality. Benefiting from the programs and the models' generalization, CityGenAgent supports natural language editing and manipulation. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate superior semantic alignment, visual quality, and controllability compared to existing methods, establishing a robust foundation for scalable 3D city generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[GAS: Enhancing Reward-Cost Balance of Generative Model-assisted Offline Safe RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05323v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL) aims to learn a policy to achieve high performance in sequential decision-making while satisfying constraints, using only pre-collected datasets. Recent works, inspired by the strong capabilities of Generative Models (GMs), reformulate decision-making in OSRL as a conditional generative process, where GMs generate desirable actions conditioned on predefined reward and cost values. However, GM-assisted methods face two major challenges in OSRL: (1) lacking the ability to "stitch" optimal transitions from suboptimal trajectories within the dataset, and (2) struggling to balance reward targets with cost targets, particularly when they are conflict. To address these issues, we propose Goal-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel algorithm designed to enhance stitching capabilities while effectively balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction. To enhance the stitching ability, GAS first augments and relabels the dataset at the transition level, enabling the construction of high-quality trajectories from suboptimal ones. GAS also introduces novel goal functions, which estimate the optimal achievable reward and cost goals from the dataset. These goal functions, trained using expectile regression on the relabeled and augmented dataset, allow GAS to accommodate a broader range of reward-cost return pairs and achieve a better tradeoff between reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to human-specified values. The estimated goals then guide policy training, ensuring robust performance under constrained settings. Furthermore, to improve training stability and efficiency, we reshape the dataset to achieve a more uniform reward-cost return distribution. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of GAS, demonstrating superior performance in balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Differential Reinforcement Learning (Differential RL), a novel framework that reformulates RL from a continuous-time control perspective via a differential dual formulation. This induces a Hamiltonian structure that embeds physics priors and ensures consistent trajectories without requiring explicit constraints. To implement Differential RL, we develop Differential Policy Optimization (dfPO), a pointwise, stage-wise algorithm that refines local movement operators along the trajectory for improved sample efficiency and dynamic alignment. We establish pointwise convergence guarantees, a property not available in standard RL, and derive a competitive theoretical regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(K^{5/6})$. Empirically, dfPO outperforms standard RL baselines on representative scientific computing tasks, including surface modeling, grid control, and molecular dynamics, under low-data and physics-constrained conditions.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

On commonly used evaluation metrics, ACE-Step v1.5 achieves quality beyond most commercial music models while remaining extremely fast -- under 2 seconds per full song on an A100 and under 10 seconds on an RTX 3090. The model runs locally with less than 4GB of VRAM, and supports lightweight personalization: users can train a LoRA from just a few songs to capture their own style. At its core lies a novel hybrid architecture where the Language Model (LM) functions as an omni-capable planner: it transforms simple user queries into comprehensive song blueprints -- scaling from short loops to 10-minute compositions -- while synthesizing metadata, lyrics, and captions via Chain-of-Thought to guide the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Uniquely, this alignment is achieved through intrinsic reinforcement learning relying solely on the model's internal mechanisms, thereby eliminating the biases inherent in external reward models or human preferences. Beyond standard synthesis, ACE-Step v1.5 unifies precise stylistic control with versatile editing capabilities -- such as cover generation, repainting, and vocal-to-BGM conversion -- while maintaining strict adherence to prompts across 50+ languages. This paves the way for powerful tools that seamlessly integrate into the creative workflows of music artists, producers, and content creators. The code, the model weights and the demo are available at: https://ace-step.github.io/ace-step-v1.5.github.io/</p></details> |  |
| **[Formal Synthesis of Certifiably Robust Neural Lyapunov-Barrier Certificates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05311v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Lyapunov and barrier certificates have recently been used as powerful tools for verifying the safety and stability properties of deep reinforcement learning (RL) controllers. However, existing methods offer guarantees only under fixed ideal unperturbed dynamics, limiting their reliability in real-world applications where dynamics may deviate due to uncertainties. In this work, we study the problem of synthesizing \emph{robust neural Lyapunov barrier certificates} that maintain their guarantees under perturbations in system dynamics. We formally define a robust Lyapunov barrier function and specify sufficient conditions based on Lipschitz continuity that ensure robustness against bounded perturbations. We propose practical training objectives that enforce these conditions via adversarial training, Lipschitz neighborhood bound, and global Lipschitz regularization. We validate our approach in two practically relevant environments, Inverted Pendulum and 2D Docking. The former is a widely studied benchmark, while the latter is a safety-critical task in autonomous systems. We show that our methods significantly improve both certified robustness bounds (up to $4.6$ times) and empirical success rates under strong perturbations (up to $2.4$ times) compared to the baseline. Our results demonstrate effectiveness of training robust neural certificates for safe RL under perturbations in dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Back to Basics: Revisiting Exploration in Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning via Generative Probabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05281v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an indispensable paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard policy optimization methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often converge to low-entropy policies, leading to severe mode collapse and limited output diversity. We analyze this issue from the perspective of sampling probability dynamics, identifying that the standard objective disproportionately reinforces the highest-likelihood paths, thereby suppressing valid alternative reasoning chains. To address this, we propose a novel Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) designed to equilibrate the confidence levels across all correct responses. By incorporating Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into the advantage estimation, our method dynamically reshapes the reward signal to attenuate the gradient updates of over-confident reasoning paths, while redistributing probability mass toward under-explored correct solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances generative diversity and response entropy while maintaining competitive accuracy, effectively achieving a superior trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reasoning tasks. Empirical results on Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek models across mathematical and coding benchmarks show that ProGRPO significantly mitigates entropy collapse. Specifically, on Qwen2.5-7B, our method outperforms GRPO by 5.7% in Pass@1 and, notably, by 13.9% in Pass@32, highlighting its superior capability in generating diverse correct reasoning paths.</p></details> |  |
| **[CARL: Focusing Agentic Reinforcement Learning on Critical Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04949v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents capable of accomplishing complex tasks through multiple interactions with the environment have emerged as a popular research direction. However, in such multi-step settings, the conventional group-level policy optimization algorithm becomes suboptimal because of its underlying assumption that each action holds equal contribution, which deviates significantly from reality. Our analysis reveals that only a small fraction of actions are critical in determining the final outcome. Building on this insight, we propose CARL, a critical-action-focused reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for long-horizon agentic reasoning. CARL leverages entropy as a heuristic proxy for action criticality and achieves focused training by assigning rewards to high-criticality actions while excluding low-criticality actions from model updates, avoiding noisy credit assignment and redundant computation.

| **[MindDrive: A Vision-Language-Action Model for Autonomous Driving via Online Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13636v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion. Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. Using the lightweight Qwen-0.5B LLM, MindDrive achieves Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and Success Rate (SR) of 55.09% on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables; Project Page: https://xiaomi-mlab.github.io/MindDrive/</p></details> |
| **[Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization: Revealing and Controlling Response Length Variation in RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05261v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent applications of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant success in enhancing reasoning capabilities for complex tasks. During RLVR training, an increase in response length is often regarded as a key factor contributing to the growth of reasoning ability. However, the patterns of change in response length vary significantly across different RLVR algorithms during the training process. To provide a fundamental explanation for these variations, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the components of mainstream RLVR algorithms. We present a theoretical analysis of the factors influencing response length and validate our theory through extensive experimentation. Building upon these theoretical findings, we propose the Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization (LUSPO) algorithm. Specifically, we rectify the length bias inherent in Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), rendering its loss function unbiased with respect to response length and thereby resolving the issue of response length collapse. We conduct extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks and multimodal reasoning scenarios, where LUSPO consistently achieves superior performance. Empirical results demonstrate that LUSPO represents a novel, state-of-the-art optimization strategy compared to existing methods such as GRPO and GSPO.</p></details> |  |

Recently, score based generative models have to some extent solved the rotational symmetry ambiguity problem in category level pose estimation, but their efficiency remains limited by the high sampling cost of score-based diffusion. In this work, we propose a new framework, RFM-Pose, that accelerates category-level 6D object pose generation while actively evaluating sampled hypotheses. To improve sampling efficiency, we adopt a flow-matching generative model and generate pose candidates along an optimal transport path from a simple prior to the pose distribution. To further refine these candidates, we cast the flow-matching sampling process as a Markov decision process and apply proximal policy optimization to fine-tune the sampling policy. In particular, we interpret the flow field as a learnable policy and map an estimator to a value network, enabling joint optimization of pose generation and hypothesis scoring within a reinforcement learning framework. Experiments on the REAL275 benchmark demonstrate that RFM-Pose achieves favorable performance while significantly reducing computational cost. Moreover, similar to prior work, our approach can be readily adapted to object pose tracking and attains competitive results in this setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This is typically achieved by finding a set of diverse, non-dominated policies that form a Pareto front in the performance space. We introduce LLE-MORL, an approach that achieves interpretability by design by utilising a training scheme based on the local relationship between the parameter space and the performance space. By exploiting a locally linear map between these spaces, our method provides an interpretation of policy parameters in terms of the objectives, and this structured representation enables an efficient search within contiguous solution domains, allowing for the rapid generation of high-quality solutions without extensive retraining. Experiments across diverse continuous control domains demonstrate that LLE-MORL consistently achieves higher Pareto front quality and efficiency than state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

We propose a simulation-first framework to verify VLA architectures before real-world deployment and introduce MobileManiBench, a large-scale benchmark for mobile-based robotic manipulation. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim and powered by reinforcement learning, our pipeline autonomously generates diverse manipulation trajectories with rich annotations (language instructions, multi-view RGB-depth-segmentation images, synchronized object/robot states and actions). MobileManiBench features 2 mobile platforms (parallel-gripper and dexterous-hand robots), 2 synchronized cameras (head and right wrist), 630 objects in 20 categories, 5 skills (open, close, pull, push, pick) with over 100 tasks performed in 100 realistic scenes, yielding 300K trajectories. This design enables controlled, scalable studies of robot embodiments, sensing modalities, and policy architectures, accelerating research on data efficiency and generalization. We benchmark representative VLA models and report insights into perception, reasoning, and control in complex simulated environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Continual Learning of Local Language Models and Cloud Offloading Decisions with Budget Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00166v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locally deployed Small Language Models (SLMs) must continually support diverse tasks under strict memory and computation constraints, making selective reliance on cloud Large Language Models (LLMs) unavoidable. Regulating cloud assistance during continual learning is challenging, as naive reward-based reinforcement learning often yields unstable offloading behavior and exacerbates catastrophic forgetting as task distributions shift. We propose DA-GRPO, a dual-advantage extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization that incorporates cloud-usage constraints directly into advantage computation, avoiding fixed reward shaping and external routing models. This design enables the local model to jointly learn task competence and collaboration behavior, allowing cloud requests to emerge naturally during post-training while respecting a prescribed assistance budget. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks show that DA-GRPO improves post-switch accuracy, substantially reduces forgetting, and maintains stable cloud usage compared to prior collaborative and routing-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

We propose HoRD, a two-stage learning framework for robust humanoid control under domain shift. First, we train a high-performance teacher policy via history-conditioned reinforcement learning, where the policy infers latent dynamics context from recent state--action trajectories to adapt online to diverse randomized dynamics. Second, we perform online distillation to transfer the teacher's robust control capabilities into a transformer-based student policy that operates on sparse root-relative 3D joint keypoint trajectories. By combining history-conditioned adaptation with online distillation, HoRD enables a single policy to adapt zero-shot to unseen domains without per-domain retraining. Extensive experiments show HoRD outperforms strong baselines in robustness and transfer, especially under unseen domains and external perturbations.

This paper presents a novel Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework that captures human-like decision-making by inferring diverse reward functions, enabling robust cross-scenario adaptability. The learned reward function is utilized to maximize the likelihood of output by integrating Mamba blocks for efficient long-sequence dependency modeling with graph attention networks to encode spatial interactions among traffic agents. Comprehensive evaluations on urban intersections and roundabouts demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms various popular approaches in terms of prediction accuracy but also achieves 2.3 times higher generalization performance to unseen scenarios compared to other baselines, achieving adaptability in Out-of-Distribution settings that is competitive with fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Your Latent Reasoning is Secretly Policy Improvement Operator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16886v4)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, small models with latent recursion have obtained promising results on complex reasoning tasks. These results are typically explained by the theory that such recursion increases a networks depth, allowing it to compactly emulate the capacity of larger models. However, the performance of recursively added layers remains behind the capabilities of one pass models with the same feed forward depth. This means that in the looped version, not every recursive step effectively contributes to depth. This raises the question: when and why does latent reasoning improve performance, and when does it result in dead compute? In our work, we analyze the algorithms that latent reasoning provides answer to this question. We show that latent reasoning can be formalized as a classifier free guidance and policy improvement algorithm. Building on these insights, we propose to use a training schemes from reinforcement learning and diffusion methods for latent reasoning models. Using the Tiny Recursive Model as our testbed, we show that with our modifications we can avoid dead compute steps and reduce the total number of forward passes by 18x while maintaining performance. Broadly speaking, we show how a policy improvement perspective on recursive steps can explain model behavior and provide insights for further improvements.</p></details> |  |

Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently shown to be useful for data-centric interpretability. In this work, we analyze large-scale reinforcement learning training runs from the sophisticated environment of Full-Press Diplomacy by applying pretrained SAEs, alongside LLM-summarizer methods. We introduce Meta-Autointerp, a method for grouping SAE features into interpretable hypotheses about training dynamics. We discover fine-grained behaviors including role-playing patterns, degenerate outputs, language switching, alongside high-level strategic behaviors and environment-specific bugs. Through automated evaluation, we validate that 90% of discovered SAE Meta-Features are significant, and find a surprising reward hacking behavior. However, through two user studies, we find that even subjectively interesting and seemingly helpful SAE features may be worse than useless to humans, along with most LLM generated hypotheses. However, a subset of SAE-derived hypotheses are predictively useful for downstream tasks. We further provide validation by augmenting an untrained agent's system prompt, improving the score by +14.2%. Overall, we show that SAEs and LLM-summarizer provide complementary views into agent behavior, and together our framework forms a practical starting point for future data-centric interpretability work on ensuring trustworthy LLM behavior throughout training.</p></details> | <details><summary>autho...</summary><p>authors 1, 2 and 3 contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[EBPO: Empirical Bayes Shrinkage for Stabilizing Group-Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05165v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, dominant approaches like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical stability challenges: they suffer from high estimator variance under computational constraints (small group sizes) and vanishing gradient signals in saturated failure regimes where all responses yield identical zero rewards. To address this, we propose Empirical Bayes Policy Optimization (EBPO), a novel framework that regularizes local group-based baselines by borrowing strength from the policy's accumulated global statistics. Instead of estimating baselines in isolation, EBPO employs a shrinkage estimator that dynamically balances local group statistics with a global prior updated via Welford's online algorithm. Theoretically, we demonstrate that EBPO guarantees strictly lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), bounded entropy decay, and non-vanishing penalty signals in failure scenarios compared to GRPO. Empirically, EBPO consistently outperforms GRPO and other established baselines across diverse benchmarks, including AIME and OlympiadBench. Notably, EBPO exhibits superior training stability, achieving high-performance gains even with small group sizes, and benefits significantly from difficulty-stratified curriculum learning.</p></details> |  |

We then employ structure-aligned reinforcement learning with a novel segment-level budget to supervise the model in maintaining efficient reasoning structures throughout training. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and backbones demonstrate that CoSMo achieves superior performance, improving accuracy by \textbf{3.3} points while reducing segment usage by \textbf{28.7\%} on average compared to reasoning efficiency baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to a misalignment in the timing of publication, we respectfully request to withdraw our manuscript.

We investigate a self-supervised reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning for translation in low-resource settings using round-trip bootstrapping with the No Language Left Behind (NLLB) family of models. Our approach translates English into a target low-resource language and then back into English, using a combination of chrF++ and BLEU as the reward function on the reconstructed English sentences. Using the NLLB-MD dataset, we evaluate both the 600M and 1.3B parameter NLLB models and observe consistent improvements for the following languages: Central Aymara, Friulian, Wolof and Russian. Qualitative inspection of translation outputs indicates increased fluency and semantic fidelity. We argue that our method can further benefit from scale, enabling models to increasingly leverage their pretrained knowledge and continue self-improving.

| **[Beware Untrusted Simulators -- Reward-Free Backdoor Attacks in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05089v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulated environments are a key piece in the success of Reinforcement Learning (RL), allowing practitioners and researchers to train decision making agents without running expensive experiments on real hardware. Simulators remain a security blind spot, however, enabling adversarial developers to alter the dynamics of their released simulators for malicious purposes. Therefore, in this work we highlight a novel threat, demonstrating how simulator dynamics can be exploited to stealthily implant action-level backdoors into RL agents. The backdoor then allows an adversary to reliably activate targeted actions in an agent upon observing a predefined ``trigger'', leading to potentially dangerous consequences. Traditional backdoor attacks are limited in their strong threat models, assuming the adversary has near full control over an agent's training pipeline, enabling them to both alter and observe agent's rewards. As these assumptions are infeasible to implement within a simulator, we propose a new attack ``Daze'' which is able to reliably and stealthily implant backdoors into RL agents trained for real world tasks without altering or even observing their rewards. We provide formal proof of Daze's effectiveness in guaranteeing attack success across general RL tasks along with extensive empirical evaluations on both discrete and continuous action space domains. We additionally provide the first example of RL backdoor attacks transferring to real, robotic hardware. These developments motivate further research into securing all components of the RL training pipeline to prevent malicious attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main body, ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Screening features low prevalence of relevant studies and scarce, costly expert decisions. Traditional active learning (AL) systems help, yet typically rely on fixed query strategies for selecting the next unlabeled documents. These static strategies do not adapt over time and ignore the relational structure of scientific literature networks. This thesis introduces AutoDiscover, a framework that reframes AL as an online decision-making problem driven by an adaptive agent. Literature is modeled as a heterogeneous graph capturing relationships among documents, authors, and metadata. A Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) learns node representations, which a Discounted Thompson Sampling (DTS) agent uses to dynamically manage a portfolio of query strategies. With real-time human-in-the-loop labels, the agent balances exploration and exploitation under non-stationary review dynamics, where strategy utility changes over time. On the 26-dataset SYNERGY benchmark, AutoDiscover achieves higher screening efficiency than static AL baselines. Crucially, the agent mitigates cold start by bootstrapping discovery from minimal initial labels where static approaches fail. We also introduce TS-Insight, an open-source visual analytics dashboard to interpret, verify, and diagnose the agent's decisions. Together, these contributions accelerate SLR screening under scarce expert labels and low prevalence of relevant studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master's Thesis, University of Luxembourg in collaboration with Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST).

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel pipeline that produces a neuro-symbolic feature representation that encompasses semantic, spatial, and shape information, as well as spatially boosted features of dynamic entities in the scene, with an emphasis on safety-critical road users. It also proposes a Soft First-Order Logic (SFOL) reward function that balances human values via a symbolic reasoning module. Here, semantic and spatial predicates are extracted from segmentation maps and applied to linguistic rules to obtain reward weights. Quantitative experiments in the CARLA simulation environment show that the proposed neuro-symbolic representation and SFOL reward function improved policy robustness and safety-related performance metrics compared to baseline representations and reward formulations across varying traffic densities and occlusion levels. The findings demonstrate that integrating holistic representations and soft reasoning into Reinforcement Learning can support more context-aware and value-aligned decision-making for autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to enhance adaptive collision avoidance in ADR missions, specifically for multi-debris removal using small satellites. Small satellites are increasingly adopted due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness, and maneuverability, making them well suited for dynamic missions such as ADR. Building on existing work in multi-debris rendezvous, the framework integrates refueling strategies, efficient mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance to optimize spacecraft rendezvous operations. The proposed approach employs a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling the RL agent to dynamically adjust maneuvers in response to real-time orbital conditions. Key considerations include fuel efficiency, avoidance of active collision zones, and optimization of dynamic orbital parameters. The RL agent learns to determine efficient sequences for rendezvousing with multiple debris targets, optimizing fuel usage and mission time while incorporating necessary refueling stops. Simulated ADR scenarios derived from the Iridium 33 debris dataset are used for evaluation, covering diverse orbital configurations and debris distributions to demonstrate robustness and adaptability. Results show that the proposed RL framework reduces collision risk while improving mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches. This work provides a scalable solution for planning complex multi-debris ADR missions and is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted at Conference: 15th IAA Symposium on Small Satellites for Earth System Observation At: Berlin</p></details> |

We propose StagePilot, an offline RL-based dialogue agent that simulates the stage-wise progression of grooming behaviors for prevention training. StagePilot selects conversational stages using a composite reward that balances user sentiment and goal proximity, with transitions constrained to adjacent stages for realism and interpretability. We evaluate StagePilot through LLM-based simulations, measuring stage completion, dialogue efficiency, and emotional engagement. Results show that StagePilot generates realistic and coherent conversations aligned with grooming dynamics. Among tested methods, the IQL+AWAC agent achieves the best balance between strategic planning and emotional coherence, reaching the final stage up to 43% more frequently than baselines while maintaining over 70% sentiment alignment.</p></details> |  |

One common challenge that arises in this setting is the out-of-distribution (OOD) error, which occurs when the policy leaves the training distribution. Prior methods penalize a statistical distance term to keep the policy close to the behavior policy, but this constrains policy improvement and may not completely prevent OOD actions. Another challenge is that the optimal policy distribution can be multimodal and difficult to represent. Recent works apply diffusion or flow policies to address this problem, but it is unclear how to avoid OOD errors while retaining policy expressiveness. We propose ReFORM, an offline RL method based on flow policies that enforces the less restrictive support constraint by construction. ReFORM learns a behavior cloning (BC) flow policy with a bounded source distribution to capture the support of the action distribution, then optimizes a reflected flow that generates bounded noise for the BC flow while keeping the support, to maximize the performance. Across 40 challenging tasks from the OGBench benchmark with datasets of varying quality and using a constant set of hyperparameters for all tasks, ReFORM dominates all baselines with hand-tuned hyperparameters on the performance profile curves.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 17 figures; Accepted by the fourteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2026)</p></details> |

In decision-time planning, state representations are critical as they must support local cost computation while preserving long-horizon structure. In this paper, we show that the Laplacian representation provides an effective latent space for planning by capturing state-space distances at multiple time scales. This representation preserves meaningful distances and naturally decomposes long-horizon problems into subgoals, also mitigating the compounding errors that arise over long prediction horizons. Building on these properties, we introduce ALPS, a hierarchical planning algorithm, and demonstrate that it outperforms commonly used baselines on a selection of offline goal-conditioned RL tasks from OGBench, a benchmark previously dominated by model-free methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[GIFT: Group-relative Implicit Fine Tuning Integrates GRPO with DPO and UNA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23868v3)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I propose \textbf{G}roup-relative \textbf{I}mplicit \textbf{F}ine \textbf{T}uning (GIFT), a novel reinforcement learning framework for aligning LLMs. Instead of directly maximizing cumulative rewards like PPO or GRPO, GIFT minimizes the discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models. It combines three key ideas: (1) the online multi-response generation and normalization of GRPO, (2) the implicit reward formulation of DPO, and (3) the implicit-explicit reward alignment principle of UNA. By jointly normalizing the implicit and explicit rewards, GIFT eliminates an otherwise intractable term that prevents effective use of implicit rewards. This normalization transforms the complex reward maximization objective into a simple mean squared error (MSE) loss between the normalized reward functions, converting a non-convex optimization problem into a convex, stable, and analytically differentiable formulation. Unlike offline methods such as DPO and UNA, GIFT remains on-policy and thus retains exploration capability. Compared to GRPO, it requires fewer hyperparameters, converges faster, and generalizes better with significantly reduced training overfitting. Empirically, GIFT achieves superior reasoning and alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks while remaining computationally efficient.</p></details> |  |

However, extending this paradigm to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) through verbose rationales yields limited gains for perception and can even degrade performance. We propose Reinforced Attention Learning (RAL), a policy-gradient framework that directly optimizes internal attention distributions rather than output token sequences. By shifting optimization from what to generate to where to attend, RAL promotes effective information allocation and improved grounding in complex multimodal inputs. Experiments across diverse image and video benchmarks show consistent gains over GRPO and other baselines. We further introduce On-Policy Attention Distillation, demonstrating that transferring latent attention behaviors yields stronger cross-modal alignment than standard knowledge distillation. Our results position attention policies as a principled and general alternative for multimodal post-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking the Trust Region in LLM Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04879v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) serving as the de facto standard algorithm. Despite its ubiquity, we argue that the core ratio clipping mechanism in PPO is structurally ill-suited for the large vocabularies inherent to LLMs. PPO constrains policy updates based on the probability ratio of sampled tokens, which serves as a noisy single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of the true policy divergence. This creates a sub-optimal learning dynamic: updates to low-probability tokens are aggressively over-penalized, while potentially catastrophic shifts in high-probability tokens are under-constrained, leading to training inefficiency and instability. To address this, we propose Divergence Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO), which substitutes heuristic clipping with a more principled constraint based on a direct estimate of policy divergence (e.g., Total Variation or KL). To avoid huge memory footprint, we introduce the efficient Binary and Top-K approximations to capture the essential divergence with negligible overhead. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that DPPO achieves superior training stability and efficiency compared to existing methods, offering a more robust foundation for RL-based LLM fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark suite for CRL based on realistically simulated robots in the Gazebo simulator. Our Continual Robotic Simulation Suite (CRoSS) benchmarks rely on two robotic platforms: a two-wheeled differential-drive robot with lidar, camera and bumper sensor, and a robotic arm with seven joints. The former represent an agent in line-following and object-pushing scenarios, where variation of visual and structural parameters yields a large number of distinct tasks, whereas the latter is used in two goal-reaching scenarios with high-level cartesian hand position control (modeled after the Continual World benchmark), and low-level control based on joint angles. For the robotic arm benchmarks, we provide additional kinematics-only variants that bypass the need for physical simulation (as long as no sensor readings are required), and which can be run two orders of magnitude faster. CRoSS is designed to be easily extensible and enables controlled studies of continual reinforcement learning in robotic settings with high physical realism, and in particular allow the use of almost arbitrary simulated sensors. To ensure reproducibility and ease of use, we provide a containerized setup (Apptainer) that runs out-of-the-box, and report performances of standard RL algorithms, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and policy gradient methods. This highlights the suitability as a scalable and reproducible benchmark for CRL research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privileged Information Distillation for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04942v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training-time privileged information (PI) can enable language models to succeed on tasks they would otherwise fail, making it a powerful tool for reinforcement learning in hard, long-horizon settings. However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, where closed-source systems typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce π-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically we find that π-Distill and in some cases OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI. We complement our results with extensive analysis that characterizes the factors enabling effective learning with PI, focusing primarily on π-Distill and characterizing when OPSD is competitive.</p></details> | <details><summary>Abstr...</summary><p>Abstract border should have been purple</p></details> |

We present STREAM-RL, a unified framework that introduces three novel algorithmic contributions: (1) PU-GAT+, an Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Conformal Forecaster that uses prediction uncertainty to dynamically reweight graph attention via confidence-monotonic attention, achieving distribution-free coverage guarantees; (2) CRFN-BY, a Conformal Residual Flow Network that models uncertainty-normalized residuals via normalizing flows with Benjamini-Yekutieli FDR control under arbitrary dependence; and (3) LyCon-WRL+, an Uncertainty-Guided Safe World-Model RL agent with Lyapunov stability certificates, certified Lipschitz bounds, and uncertainty-propagated imagination rollouts. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to propagate calibrated uncertainty from forecasting through anomaly detection to safe policy learning with end-to-end theoretical guarantees. Experiments on multiple real-world traffic trajectory data demonstrate that STREAM-RL achieves 91.4\% coverage efficiency, controls FDR at 4.1\% under verified dependence, and improves safety rate to 95.2\% compared to 69\% for standard PPO while achieving higher reward, with 23ms end-to-end inference latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Rewards in Reinforcement Learning for Cyber Defence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04809v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in autonomous cyber defence agents trained to defend computer networks using deep reinforcement learning. These agents are typically trained in cyber gym environments using dense, highly engineered reward functions which combine many penalties and incentives for a range of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Dense rewards help alleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments but risk biasing agents towards suboptimal and potentially riskier solutions, a critical issue in complex cyber environments. We thoroughly evaluate the impact of reward function structure on learning and policy behavioural characteristics using a variety of sparse and dense reward functions, two well-established cyber gyms, a range of network sizes, and both policy gradient and value-based RL algorithms. Our evaluation is enabled by a novel ground truth evaluation approach which allows directly comparing between different reward functions, illuminating the nuanced inter-relationships between rewards, action space and the risks of suboptimal policies in cyber environments. Our results show that sparse rewards, provided they are goal aligned and can be encountered frequently, uniquely offer both enhanced training reliability and more effective cyber defence agents with lower-risk policies. Surprisingly, sparse rewards can also yield policies that are better aligned with cyber defender goals and make sparing use of costly defensive actions without explicit reward-based numerical penalties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Sleep Mode Activation and Load Balancing with Dynamic Cell Load: A Combinatorial Bandit Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04808v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a combinatorial bandit formulation to opportunistically trigger sleep modes in gNode-B (gNB) small cells (SCs), followed by a cell range expansion (CRE)-based load balancing procedure. This is implemented by ensuring that the fifth generation (5G) quality of service identifier (5QI)-requirements of user equipments (UEs) are maintained. The key challenge is the fact that while deactivating a given SC gNB reduces its own consumption, it may increase the load on neighboring gNBs and the macro gNB (coverage cell), impacting the overall energy efficiency. This phenomenon is accurately characterized by modeling the dynamic cell load that jointly takes into account the location of the UEs, their relative locations to all the SCs, and their data demands. We experimentally show that the proposed combinatorial upper confidence bound (CUCB) followed by the load balancer outperforms not only the naive strategies like arbitrarily keeping all the SCs on, but also other state-of-the-art reinforcement learning solutions. The proposed algorithm can be implemented as open-radio access network (O-RAN) near-real-time (NRT) RAN intelligent controller (RIC) xApps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolving Afferent Architectures: Biologically-inspired Models for Damage-Avoidance Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04807v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Afferent Learning, a framework that produces Computational Afferent Traces (CATs) as adaptive, internal risk signals for damage-avoidance learning. Inspired by biological systems, the framework uses a two-level architecture: evolutionary optimization (outer loop) discovers afferent sensing architectures that enable effective policy learning, while reinforcement learning (inner loop) trains damage-avoidance policies using these signals. This formalizes afferent sensing as providing an inductive bias for efficient learning: architectures are selected based on their ability to enable effective learning (rather than directly minimizing damage). We provide theoretical convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded-noise assumptions. We illustrate the general approach in the challenging context of biomechanical digital twins operating over long time horizons (multiple decades of the life-course). Here, we find that CAT-based evolved architectures achieve significantly higher efficiency and better age-robustness than hand-designed baselines, enabling policies that exhibit age-dependent behavioral adaptation (23% reduction in high-risk actions). Ablation studies validate CAT signals, evolution, and predictive discrepancy as essential. We release code and data for reproducibility.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Skin Tokens: A Learned Compact Representation for Unified Autoregressive Rigging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04805v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of generative 3D models has created a critical bottleneck in animation pipelines: rigging. Existing automated methods are fundamentally limited by their approach to skinning, treating it as an ill-posed, high-dimensional regression task that is inefficient to optimize and is typically decoupled from skeleton generation. We posit this is a representation problem and introduce SkinTokens: a learned, compact, and discrete representation for skinning weights. By leveraging an FSQ-CVAE to capture the intrinsic sparsity of skinning, we reframe the task from continuous regression to a more tractable token sequence prediction problem. This representation enables TokenRig, a unified autoregressive framework that models the entire rig as a single sequence of skeletal parameters and SkinTokens, learning the complicated dependencies between skeletons and skin deformations. The unified model is then amenable to a reinforcement learning stage, where tailored geometric and semantic rewards improve generalization to complex, out-of-distribution assets. Quantitatively, the SkinTokens representation leads to a 98%-133% percents improvement in skinning accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, while the full TokenRig framework, refined with RL, enhances bone prediction by 17%-22%. Our work presents a unified, generative approach to rigging that yields higher fidelity and robustness, offering a scalable solution to a long-standing challenge in 3D content creation.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality. Early in training, the process relies on the original and rewritten suffixes; as the model improves, RL rewards high-quality rollouts. This approach builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up. In experiments, our method gives 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements over standard pretraining in terms of factuality and safety, and up to 86.3% win rate improvements in overall generation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Silence Is Golden: Can LLMs Learn to Abstain in Temporal QA and Beyond?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04755v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) rarely admit uncertainty, often producing fluent but misleading answers, rather than abstaining (i.e., refusing to answer). This weakness is even evident in temporal question answering, where models frequently ignore time-sensitive evidence and conflate facts across different time-periods. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of training LLMs with an abstention ability while reasoning about temporal QA. Existing approaches such as calibration might be unreliable in capturing uncertainty in complex reasoning. We instead frame abstention as a teachable skill and introduce a pipeline that couples Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision with Reinforcement Learning (RL) guided by abstention-aware rewards. Our goal is to systematically analyze how different information types and training techniques affect temporal reasoning with abstention behavior in LLMs. Through extensive experiments studying various methods, we find that RL yields strong empirical gains on reasoning: a model initialized by Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct surpasses GPT-4o by $3.46\%$ and $5.80\%$ in Exact Match on TimeQA-Easy and Hard, respectively. Moreover, it improves the True Positive rate on unanswerable questions by $20\%$ over a pure supervised fine-tuned (SFT) variant. Beyond performance, our analysis shows that SFT induces overconfidence and harms reliability, while RL improves prediction accuracy but exhibits similar risks. Finally, by comparing implicit reasoning cues (e.g., original context, temporal sub-context, knowledge graphs) with explicit CoT supervision, we find that implicit information provides limited benefit for reasoning with abstention. Our study provides new insights into how abstention and reasoning can be jointly optimized, providing a foundation for building more reliable LLMs.</p></details> | Accepted to ICLR2026 |
| **[Rationality Measurement and Theory for Reinforcement Learning Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04737v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a suite of rationality measures and associated theory for reinforcement learning agents, a property increasingly critical yet rarely explored. We define an action in deployment to be perfectly rational if it maximises the hidden true value function in the steepest direction. The expected value discrepancy of a policy's actions against their rational counterparts, culminating over the trajectory in deployment, is defined to be expected rational risk; an empirical average version in training is also defined. Their difference, termed as rational risk gap, is decomposed into (1) an extrinsic component caused by environment shifts between training and deployment, and (2) an intrinsic one due to the algorithm's generalisability in a dynamic environment. They are upper bounded by, respectively, (1) the $1$-Wasserstein distance between transition kernels and initial state distributions in training and deployment, and (2) the empirical Rademacher complexity of the value function class. Our theory suggests hypotheses on the benefits from regularisers (including layer normalisation, $\ell_2$ regularisation, and weight normalisation) and domain randomisation, as well as the harm from environment shifts. Experiments are in full agreement with these hypotheses. The code is available at https://github.com/EVIEHub/Rationality.</p></details> |  |
| **[ERNIE 5.0 Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04705v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this report, we introduce ERNIE 5.0, a natively autoregressive foundation model desinged for unified multimodal understanding and generation across text, image, video, and audio. All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERNIE 5.0 achieves strong and balanced performance across multiple modalities. To the best of our knowledge, among publicly disclosed models, ERNIE 5.0 represents the first production-scale realization of a trillion-parameter unified autoregressive model that supports both multimodal understanding and generation. To facilitate further research, we present detailed visualizations of modality-agnostic expert routing in the unified model, alongside comprehensive empirical analysis of elastic training, aiming to offer profound insights to the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Do Credal Sets Stabilize? Fixed-Point Theorems for Credal Set Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04769v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many machine learning algorithms rely on iterative updates of uncertainty representations, ranging from variational inference and expectation-maximization, to reinforcement learning, continual learning, and multi-agent learning. In the presence of imprecision and ambiguity, credal sets -- closed, convex sets of probability distributions -- have emerged as a popular framework for representing imprecise probabilistic beliefs. Under such imprecision, many learning problems in imprecise probabilistic machine learning (IPML) may be viewed as processes involving successive applications of update rules on credal sets. This naturally raises the question of whether this iterative process converges to stable fixed points -- or, more generally, under what conditions on the updating mechanism such fixed points exist, and whether they can be attained. We provide the first analysis of this problem, and illustrate our findings using Credal Bayesian Deep Learning as a concrete example. Our work demonstrates that incorporating imprecision into the learning process not only enriches the representation of uncertainty, but also reveals structural conditions under which stability emerges, thereby offering new insights into the dynamics of iterative learning under imprecision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information Templates: A New Paradigm for Intelligent Active Feature Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18380v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active feature acquisition (AFA) is an instance-adaptive paradigm in which, at inference time, a policy sequentially chooses which features to acquire (at a cost) before predicting. Existing approaches either train reinforcement learning policies, which deal with a difficult MDP, or greedy policies that cannot account for the joint informativeness of features or require knowledge about the underlying data distribution. To overcome this, we propose Template-based AFA (TAFA), a non-greedy framework that learns a small library of feature templates -- sets of features that are jointly informative -- and uses this library of templates to guide the next feature acquisitions. Through identifying feature templates, the proposed framework not only significantly reduces the action space considered by the policy but also alleviates the need to estimate the underlying data distribution. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that TAFA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Source Retrieval and Reasoning for Legal Sentencing Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04690v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legal judgment prediction (LJP) aims to predict judicial outcomes from case facts and typically includes law article, charge, and sentencing prediction. While recent methods perform well on the first two subtasks, legal sentencing prediction (LSP) remains difficult due to its need for fine-grained objective knowledge and flexible subjective reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose $MSR^2$, a framework that integrates multi-source retrieval and reasoning in LLMs with reinforcement learning. $MSR^2$ enables LLMs to perform multi-source retrieval based on reasoning needs and applies a process-level reward to guide intermediate subjective reasoning steps. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that $MSR^2$ improves both accuracy and interpretability in LSP, providing a promising step toward practical legal AI.

However, these tasks remain challenging because diffusion models have intractable likelihoods, which creates a barrier for directly applying popular policy-gradient type methods. Existing approaches primarily focus on crafting new objectives built on already heavily engineered LLM objectives, using ad hoc estimators for likelihood, without a thorough investigation into how such estimation affects overall algorithmic performance. In this work, we provide a systematic analysis of the RL design space by disentangling three factors: i) policy-gradient objectives, ii) likelihood estimators, and iii) rollout sampling schemes. We show that adopting an evidence lower bound (ELBO) based model likelihood estimator, computed only from the final generated sample, is the dominant factor enabling effective, efficient, and stable RL optimization, outweighing the impact of the specific policy-gradient loss functional. We validate our findings across multiple reward benchmarks using SD 3.5 Medium, and observe consistent trends across all tasks. Our method improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.95 in 90 GPU hours, which is $4.6\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO and $2\times$ more efficient than the SOTA method DiffusionNFT without reward hacking.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

We investigate the derivation of these constraints, critically examine the underlying assumptions, and evaluate their practical implications for system-level safety and performance in industrially relevant scenarios. Key design parameters within safety-critical control architectures are identified, and numerical examples are provided to quantify performance degradation arising from typical approximations and design decisions in manufacturing environments. Within this analysis, the fundamental role of energy in safety assessment is emphasized, providing focused insights into energy-based safety methodologies for collaborative industrial robot systems.</p></details> |  |

While traditional systems often rely on manually engineered, single-sensor pipelines, this paper presents a learning-based framework that uses an intermediate, robot-centric heightmap representation. A hybrid Encoder-Decoder Structure (EDS) is introduced, utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for spatial feature extraction fused with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) core for temporal consistency. The architecture integrates multimodal data from an Intel RealSense depth camera, a LIVOX MID-360 LiDAR processed via efficient spherical projection, and an onboard IMU. Quantitative results demonstrate that multimodal fusion improves reconstruction accuracy by 7.2% over depth-only and 9.9% over LiDAR-only configurations. Furthermore, the integration of a 3.2 s temporal context reduces mapping drift.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches are typically based on object- or task-specific affordances, but their ability to generalize to novel scenarios is limited. To address this gap, we present AFT-Handover, a framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-driven affordance reasoning with efficient texture-based affordance transfer to achieve zero-shot, generalizable TOH. Given a novel object-task pair, the method retrieves a proxy exemplar from a database, establishes part-level correspondences via LLM reasoning, and texturizes affordances for feature-based point cloud transfer. We evaluate AFT-Handover across diverse task-object pairs, showing improved handover success rates and stronger generalization compared to baselines. In a comparative user study, our framework is significantly preferred over the current state-of-the-art, effectively reducing human regrasping before tool use. Finally, we demonstrate TOH on legged manipulators, highlighting the potential of our framework for real-world robot-human handovers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 21st ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) 2026</p></details> |

In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis of robotics publications between 1980 and 2024 that mention DDD, and find that only 2.7% of publications define DDD and 8.7% of publications provide concrete examples of tasks or jobs that are DDD. We then review the social science literature on "dull," "dirty," and "dangerous" work to provide definitions and guidance on how to conceptualize DDD for robotics. Finally, we propose a framework that helps the robotics community consider the job context for our technology, encouraging a more informed perspective on how robotics may impact human labor.</p></details> |  |

We present an implementation-aware analysis and tuning workflow for saturated discrete-time joint control. We (i) derive PI stability regions under Euler and exact zero-order-hold (ZOH) discretizations using the Jury criterion, (ii) evaluate a discrete back-calculation anti-windup realization under saturation-dominant regimes, and (iii) propose a hybrid-certified Bayesian optimization workflow that screens analytically unstable candidates and behaviorally unsafe transients while optimizing a robust IAE objective with soft penalties on overshoot and saturation duty. Baseline sweeps ($τ=1.0$~s, $Δt=0.01$~s, $u\in[-10,10]$) quantify rise/settle trends for P/PI/PID. Under a randomized model family emulating uncertainty, delay, noise, quantization, and tighter saturation, robustness-oriented tuning improves median IAE from $0.843$ to $0.430$ while keeping median overshoot below $2\%$. In simulation-only tuning, the certification screen rejects $11.6\%$ of randomly sampled gains within bounds before full robust evaluation, improving sample efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pendi...</summary><p>Pending IEEE Transactions on Robotics Publication</p></details> |

In this chapter we explore some of the fundamentals of robot scientists in the philosophy of science. We also map the activities of a robot scientist to machine learning paradigms, and argue that the scientific method shares an analogy with active learning. We demonstrate these concepts using examples from previous robot scientists, and also from Genesis: a next generation robot scientist designed for research in systems biology, comprising a micro-fluidic system with 1000 computer-controlled micro-bioreactors and interpretable models based in controlled vocabularies and logic.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, book chapter</p></details> |

Extending PI3DETR, our method streamlines parametric 3D object detection by jointly estimating multi-class 6-DoF poses and class-specific parametric attributes directly from occlusion-affected point cloud data. This formulation enables not only geometric localization but also the estimation of task-relevant properties for parametric objects, such as a gripper's opening, where the 3D model is adjusted according to simple, predefined rules. The architecture employs modular, class-specific heads, making it straightforward to extend to novel object types without re-designing the pipeline. We validate PIRATR on an automated forklift platform, focusing on three structurally and functionally diverse categories: crane grippers, loading platforms, and pallets. Trained entirely in a synthetic environment, PIRATR generalizes effectively to real outdoor LiDAR scans, achieving a detection mAP of 0.919 without additional fine-tuning. PIRATR establishes a new paradigm of pose-aware, parameterized perception. This bridges the gap between low-level geometric reasoning and actionable world models, paving the way for scalable, simulation-trained perception systems that can be deployed in dynamic robotic environments.

This limitation also extends to current soft robotic micromanipulators. Here, we introduce FilMBot, a 3-DOF film-based, electromagnetically actuated, soft kinematic robotic micromanipulator achieving speeds up to 2117 °/s and 2456 °/s in α and \{beta} angular motions, with corresponding linear velocities of 1.61 m/s and 1.92 m/s using a 4-cm needle end-effector, 0.54 m/s along the Z axis, and 1.57 m/s during Z-axis morph switching. The robot can reach ~1.50 m/s in path-following tasks, with an operational bandwidth below ~30 Hz, and remains responsive at 50 Hz. It demonstrates high precision (~6.3 μm, or ~0.05% of its workspace) in path-following tasks, with precision remaining largely stable across frequencies. The novel combination of the low-stiffness soft kinematic film structure and strong electromagnetic actuation in FilMBot opens new avenues for soft robotics. Furthermore, its simple construction and inexpensive, readily accessible components could broaden the application of micromanipulators beyond current academic and professional users.</p></details> | 13 pages, 16 figures |

Thus, we attempt to answer whether the human hand, with its associated biomechanical properties, sensors, and control mechanisms, is an ideal that we should strive for in robotics-do we really need anthropomorphic robotic hands? This survey can help practitioners to make the trade-off between hand complexity and potential manipulation skills. We provide an overview of the human hand, a comparison of commercially available robotic and prosthetic hands, and a systematic review of hand mechanisms and skills that they are capable of. This leads to follow-up questions. What is the minimum requirement for mechanisms and sensors to implement most skills that a robot needs? What is missing to reach human-level dexterity? Can we improve upon human dexterity? Although complex five-fingered hands are often used as the ultimate goal for robotic manipulators, they are not necessary for all tasks. We found that wrist flexibility and finger abduction/adduction are often more important for manipulation capabilities. Increasing the number of fingers, actuators, or degrees of freedom is not always necessary. Three fingers often are a good compromise between simplicity and dexterity. Non-anthropomorphic hand designs with two opposing pairs of fingers or human hands with six fingers can further increase dexterity, suggesting that the human hand is not the optimum. Consequently, we argue for function-based rather than form-based biomimicry.</p></details> |  |

We propose a Real-Sim-Real data collection and data editing pipeline that transforms human demonstrations into robot-executable, environment-specific training data without direct robot teleoperation. Standardized data collection rooms are built to capture multimodal human demonstrations (synchronized 3 RGB-D videos, 11 RGB videos, 29-DoF glove joint angles, and 14-channel tactile signals). Based on these human demonstrations, we introduce a tactile-aware retargeting method that maps human hand states to robot dex-hand states via geometry and force-guided optimization. Then the retargeted robot trajectories are rendered in a photorealistic Isaac Sim environment to build robot training data. Real world experiments have demonstrated: (1) The retargeted dex-hand trajectories achieve an 84\% success rate across 10 diverse object manipulation tasks. (2) VLA policies (Pi0.5) trained exclusively on our generated data achieve 80\% average success rate on three representative tasks, i.e., pick-and-place, pushing and pouring. To conclude, robot training data can be efficiently "painted" from human demonstrations using our real-sim-real data pipeline. We offer a scalable, cost-effective alternative to teleoperation with minimal performance loss for complex dexterous manipulation.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Existing approaches suffer from inter-module instability in modular pipelines or conflicting training objectives in end-to-end frameworks. We propose Perception-Action integrated Decision-making (PAiD), a progressive architecture that decomposes soccer skill acquisition into three stages: motion-skill acquisition via human motion tracking, lightweight perception-action integration for positional generalization, and physics-aware sim-to-real transfer. This staged decomposition establishes stable foundational skills, avoids reward conflicts during perception integration, and minimizes sim-to-real gaps. Experiments on the Unitree G1 demonstrate high-fidelity human-like kicking with robust performance under diverse conditions-including static or rolling balls, various positions, and disturbances-while maintaining consistent execution across indoor and outdoor scenarios. Our divide-and-conquer strategy advances robust humanoid soccer capabilities and offers a scalable framework for complex embodied skill acquisition.

| **[Low-Cost Underwater In-Pipe Centering and Inspection Using a Minimal-Sensing Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05265v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous underwater inspection of submerged pipelines is challenging due to confined geometries, turbidity, and the scarcity of reliable localization cues. This paper presents a minimal-sensing strategy that enables a free-swimming underwater robot to center itself and traverse a flooded pipe of known radius using only an IMU, a pressure sensor, and two sonars: a downward-facing single-beam sonar and a rotating 360 degree sonar. We introduce a computationally efficient method for extracting range estimates from single-beam sonar intensity data, enabling reliable wall detection in noisy and reverberant conditions. A closed-form geometric model leverages the two sonar ranges to estimate the pipe center, and an adaptive, confidence-weighted proportional-derivative (PD) controller maintains alignment during traversal. The system requires no Doppler velocity log, external tracking, or complex multi-sensor arrays. Experiments in a submerged 46 cm-diameter pipe using a Blue Robotics BlueROV2 heavy remotely operated vehicle demonstrate stable centering and successful full-pipe traversal despite ambient flow and structural deformations. These results show that reliable in-pipe navigation and inspection can be achieved with a lightweight, computationally efficient sensing and processing architecture, advancing the practicality of autonomous underwater inspection in confined environments.</p></details> |  |

However, their reliance on potentially untrusted training pipelines or supply chains introduces significant security vulnerabilities. This paper investigates backdoor (Trojan) attacks against neural controllers, using a differential-drive mobile robot platform as a case study. In particular, assuming that the robot's tracking controller is implemented as a neural network, we design a lightweight, parallel Trojan network that can be embedded within the controller. This malicious module remains dormant during normal operation but, upon detecting a highly specific trigger condition defined by the robot's pose and goal parameters, compromises the primary controller's wheel velocity commands, resulting in undesired and potentially unsafe robot behaviours. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed Trojan network, which is validated through simulation under two different attack scenarios. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed attack and demonstrate that neural network-based robotic control systems are subject to potentially critical security threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper submitted to the 2026 IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications (CCTA)</p></details> |

Current state-of-the-art models address this challenge by using large amounts of training data and test-time samples to build black-box scene representations. In this work, we introduce a differentiable neuro-graphics model that combines neural foundation models with physics-based differentiable rendering to perform zero-shot scene reconstruction and robot grasping without relying on any additional 3D data or test-time samples. Our model solves a series of constrained optimization problems to estimate physically consistent scene parameters, such as meshes, lighting conditions, material properties, and 6D poses of previously unseen objects from a single RGBD image and bounding boxes. We evaluated our approach on standard model-free few-shot benchmarks and demonstrated that it outperforms existing algorithms for model-free few-shot pose estimation. Furthermore, we validated the accuracy of our scene reconstructions by applying our algorithm to a zero-shot grasping task. By enabling zero-shot, physically-consistent scene reconstruction and grasping without reliance on extensive datasets or test-time sampling, our approach offers a pathway towards more data efficient, interpretable and generalizable robot autonomy in novel environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) for review.

| **[Signal or 'Noise': Human Reactions to Robot Errors in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05010v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the real world, robots frequently make errors, yet little is known about people's social responses to errors outside of lab settings. Prior work has shown that social signals are reliable and useful for error management in constrained interactions, but it is unclear if this holds in the real world - especially with a non-social robot in repeated and group interactions with successive or propagated errors. To explore this, we built a coffee robot and conducted a public field deployment ($N = 49$). We found that participants consistently expressed varied social signals in response to errors and other stimuli, particularly during group interactions. Our findings suggest that social signals in the wild are rich (with participants volunteering information about the interaction), but "noisy." We discuss lessons, benefits, and challenges for using social signals in real-world HRI.</p></details> |  |

Incident commanders must plan, coordinate, and document time-critical operations, while field searchers execute evolving tasks in uncertain environments. With recent advances in technology, ground-robot fleets paired with computer-vision-based situational awareness and LLM-powered interfaces offer the potential to ease these operational burdens. However, no dedicated studies have examined how public safety professionals perceive such technologies or envision their integration into existing practices, risking building technically sophisticated yet impractical solutions. To address this gap, we conducted focus-group sessions with eight police officers across five local departments in Virginia. Our findings show that ground robots could reduce professionals' reliance on paper references, mental calculations, and ad-hoc coordination, alleviating cognitive and physical strain in four key challenge areas: (1) partitioning the workforce across multiple search hypotheses, (2) retaining group awareness and situational awareness, (3) building route planning that fits the lost-person profile, and (4) managing cognitive and physical fatigue under uncertainty. We further identify four design opportunities and requirements for future ground-robot fleet integration in public-safety operations: (1) scalable multi-robot planning and control interfaces, (2) agency-specific route optimization, (3) real-time replanning informed by debrief updates, and (4) vision-assisted cueing that preserves operational trust while reducing cognitive workload. We conclude with design implications for deployable, accountable, and human-centered urban-search support systems</p></details> | Under review |

In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark suite for CRL based on realistically simulated robots in the Gazebo simulator. Our Continual Robotic Simulation Suite (CRoSS) benchmarks rely on two robotic platforms: a two-wheeled differential-drive robot with lidar, camera and bumper sensor, and a robotic arm with seven joints. The former represent an agent in line-following and object-pushing scenarios, where variation of visual and structural parameters yields a large number of distinct tasks, whereas the latter is used in two goal-reaching scenarios with high-level cartesian hand position control (modeled after the Continual World benchmark), and low-level control based on joint angles. For the robotic arm benchmarks, we provide additional kinematics-only variants that bypass the need for physical simulation (as long as no sensor readings are required), and which can be run two orders of magnitude faster. CRoSS is designed to be easily extensible and enables controlled studies of continual reinforcement learning in robotic settings with high physical realism, and in particular allow the use of almost arbitrary simulated sensors. To ensure reproducibility and ease of use, we provide a containerized setup (Apptainer) that runs out-of-the-box, and report performances of standard RL algorithms, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and policy gradient methods. This highlights the suitability as a scalable and reproducible benchmark for CRL research.</p></details> |  |
| **[PDF-HR: Pose Distance Fields for Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04851v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pose and motion priors play a crucial role in humanoid robotics. Although such priors have been widely studied in human motion recovery (HMR) domain with a range of models, their adoption for humanoid robots remains limited, largely due to the scarcity of high-quality humanoid motion data. In this work, we introduce Pose Distance Fields for Humanoid Robots (PDF-HR), a lightweight prior that represents the robot pose distribution as a continuous and differentiable manifold. Given an arbitrary pose, PDF-HR predicts its distance to a large corpus of retargeted robot poses, yielding a smooth measure of pose plausibility that is well suited for optimization and control. PDF-HR can be integrated as a reward shaping term, a regularizer, or a standalone plausibility scorer across diverse pipelines. We evaluate PDF-HR on various humanoid tasks, including single-trajectory motion tracking, general motion tracking, style-based motion mimicry, and general motion retargeting. Experiments show that this plug-and-play prior consistently and substantially strengthens strong baselines. Code and models will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>\href...</summary><p>\href{https://gaoyukang33.github.io/PDF-HR/}{Project page}</p></details> |
| **[Beyond the Control Equations: An Artifact Study of Implementation Quality in Robot Control Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04799v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A controller -- a software module managing hardware behavior -- is a key component of a typical robot system. While control theory gives safety guarantees for standard controller designs, the practical implementation of controllers in software introduces complexities that are often overlooked. Controllers are often designed in continuous space, while the software is executed in discrete space, undermining some of the theoretical guarantees. Despite extensive research on control theory and control modeling, little attention has been paid to the implementations of controllers and how their theoretical guarantees are ensured in real-world software systems. We investigate 184 real-world controller implementations in open-source robot software. We examine their application context, the implementation characteristics, and the testing methods employed to ensure correctness. We find that the implementations often handle discretization in an ad hoc manner, leading to potential issues with real-time reliability. Challenges such as timing inconsistencies, lack of proper error handling, and inadequate consideration of real-time constraints further complicate matters. Testing practices are superficial, no systematic verification of theoretical guarantees is used, leaving possible inconsistencies between expected and actual behavior. Our findings highlight the need for improved implementation guidelines and rigorous verification techniques to ensure the reliability and safety of robotic controllers in practice.</p></details> |  |

This platform offers a scalable cable-driven actuation system and a customizable, puppet-inspired robot gesture framework, supporting a multitude of interaction gesture robot design formats. The platform comprises a four-layer decoupled software architecture that includes perceptual processing, affective modeling, motion scheduling, and low-level actuation. We also implemented an affective expression loop that connects human input to the robot platform by producing real-time emotional gestural responses to human vocal input. For our own designs, we have worked with nuanced gestures enacted by "soft robots" with enhanced dexterity and "pleasant-to-touch" plush exteriors. By reducing operational complexity and production costs while enhancing customizability, our work creates an adaptable and accessible foundation for future tactile-based expressive robot research. Our goal is to provide a platform that allows researchers to independently construct or refine highly specific gestures and movements performed by social robots.</p></details> |  |

Especially in applications such as shared control the user and the robot must share the same model of the objects in the world, and the actions that can be performed on these objects. In this paper, we achieve this with a so-called model reconciliation framework. We leverage a Large Language Model to predict and explain the difference between the robot's and the human's mental models, without the need of a formal mental model of the user. Furthermore, our framework aims to solve the model divergence after the explanation by allowing the human to correct the robot. We provide an implementation in an assistive robotics domain, where we conduct a set of experiments with a real wheelchair-based mobile manipulator and its digital twin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2026</p></details> |

We design a canonical accumulation procedure that maps arbitrary configurations to configurations that occupy a fixed subset of vertices, enabling us to analyze configuration reachability in terms of equivalence classes. We prove that in instances that are not universally solvable, at least half of all configurations are unreachable from a given one, and leverage this to design an efficient randomized algorithm with one-sided error, which can be derandomized with a blow-up in the running time by a factor of p. Further, we optimize our deterministic algorithm by using the structure of the input graph G = (V, E), achieving a running time of O(p * (|V| + |E|)) in sparse graphs and O(|V| + |E|) in dense graphs. Finally, we consider the Graph Edge Augmentation for Universal Solvability (EAUS) problem, where given a connected graph G that is not universally solvable for p robots, the question is to check if for a given budget b, at most b edges can be added to G to make it universally solvable for p robots. We provide an upper bound of p - 2 on b for general graphs. On the other hand, we also provide examples of graphs that require Theta(p) edges to be added. We further study the Graph Vertex and Edge Augmentation for Universal Solvability (VEAUS) problem, where a vertices and b edges can be added, and we provide lower bounds on a and b.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to AAMAS 2026</p></details> |

As well as transitioning robustly between sub-tasks of different types. Towards addressing these challenges, we propose a novel task - EgoActing, which requires directly grounding high-level instructions into various, precise, spatially aware humanoid actions. We further instantiate this task by introducing EgoActor, a unified and scalable vision-language model (VLM) that can predict locomotion primitives (e.g., walk, turn, move sideways, change height), head movements, manipulation commands, and human-robot interactions to coordinate perception and execution in real-time. We leverage broad supervision over egocentric RGB-only data from real-world demonstrations, spatial reasoning question-answering, and simulated environment demonstrations, enabling EgoActor to make robust, context-aware decisions and perform fluent action inference (under 1s) with both 8B and 4B parameter models. Extensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that EgoActor effectively bridges abstract task planning and concrete motor execution, while generalizing across diverse tasks and unseen environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Informing Robot Wellbeing Coach Design through Longitudinal Analysis of Human-AI Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04478v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social robots and conversational agents are being explored as supports for wellbeing, goal-setting, and everyday self-regulation. While prior work highlights their potential to motivate and guide users, much of the evidence relies on self-reported outcomes or short, researcher-mediated encounters. As a result, we know little about the interaction dynamics that unfold when people use such systems in real-world contexts, and how these dynamics should shape future robot wellbeing coaches. This paper addresses this gap through content analysis of 4352 messages exchanged longitudinally between 38 university students and an LLM-based wellbeing coach. Our results provide a fine-grained view into how users naturally shape, steer, and sometimes struggle within supportive human-AI dialogue, revealing patterns of user-led direction, guidance-seeking, and emotional expression. We discuss how these dynamics can inform the design of robot wellbeing coaches that support user autonomy, provide appropriate scaffolding, and uphold ethical boundaries in sustained wellbeing interactions.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate how a mobile robot can support group interactions for blind people. We used the scenario of a guided tour with mixed-visual groups involving blind and sighted visitors. Based on insights from an interview study with blind people (n=5) and museum experts (n=5), we designed and prototyped a robotic system that supported blind visitors to join group tours. We conducted a field study in a science museum where each blind participant (n=8) joined a group tour with one guide and two sighted participants (n=8). Findings indicated users' sense of safety from the robot's navigational support, concerns in the group participation, and preferences for obtaining environmental information. We present design implications for future robotic systems to support blind people's mixed-visual group participation.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of ACM CHI 2026 conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</p></details> |

Game-based learning (GBL) and gamification offer engagement benefits, yet their comparative impact remains unclear. We present the first PRISMA-aligned systematic review and comparative synthesis of GBL and gamification in robotics education, analyzing 95 studies from 12,485 records across four databases (2014-2025). We coded each study's approach, learning context, skill level, modality, pedagogy, and outcomes (k = .918). Three patterns emerged: (1) approach-context-pedagogy coupling (GBL more prevalent in informal settings, while gamification dominated formal classrooms [p < .001] and favored project-based learning [p = .009]); (2) emphasis on introductory programming and modular kits, with limited adoption of advanced software (~17%), advanced hardware (~5%), or immersive technologies (~22%); and (3) short study horizons, relying on self-report.

We study six home-style scenarios that require frequent attention shifts and increasing perceptual scope. Across four system variants, we evaluate turn-level tool-decision correctness against human annotations and collect subjective ratings of interaction quality. Results indicate that real-time multimodal large language models and tool use for active perception is a promising direction for practical situated embodied conversation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

This paper introduces a movement-centered design pedagogy designed to support engineers in creating expressive robotic arm movements. Through a hands-on interactive workshop informed by interdisciplinary methodologies, participants explored various creative possibilities, generating valuable insights into expressive motion design. The iterative approach proposed integrates analytical frameworks from dance, enabling designers to examine motion through dynamic and embodied dimensions. A custom manual remote controller facilitates interactive, real-time manipulation of the robotic arm, while dedicated animation software supports visualization, detailed motion sequencing, and precise parameter control. Qualitative analysis of this interactive design process reveals that the proposed "toolbox" effectively bridges the gap between human intent and robotic expressiveness resulting in more intuitive and engaging expressive robotic arm movements.</p></details> |  |

While recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D consistency of generated videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap alignment during training. Through this geometric supervision, the model learns a shared 3D scene representation, enabling it to generate spatio-temporally aligned future video sequences from novel viewpoints given a single RGB-D image per view, and without relying on camera poses as input. Compared to existing baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, yielding robot manipulation policies that generalize well to novel camera viewpoints.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026; Project website: https://robot4dgen.github.io</p></details> |

However, existing planning approaches struggle to construct accurate symbolic representations and maintain plan consistency in dynamic environments. Classical PDDL planners require manually crafted symbolic models, while LLM-based planners often ignore agent heterogeneity and environmental uncertainty. We introduce KGLAMP, a knowledge-graph-guided LLM planning framework for heterogeneous multi-robot teams. The framework maintains a structured knowledge graph encoding object relations, spatial reachability, and robot capabilities, which guides the LLM in generating accurate PDDL problem specifications. The knowledge graph serves as a persistent, dynamically updated memory that incorporates new observations and triggers replanning upon detecting inconsistencies, enabling symbolic plans to adapt to evolving world states. Experiments on the MAT-THOR benchmark show that KGLAMP improves performance by at least 25.5% over both LLM-only and PDDL-based variants.</p></details> |  |

The RUSO system achieved sub-millimeter trajectory accuracy (0.11 mm RMSE), an order of magnitude improvement over MUSO (1.10 mm RMSE). Moreover, MUSO trials showed substantial over-penetration (16.0 mm achieved vs. 8.0 mm target), whereas the RUSO system maintained precise depth control (8.1 mm). These results demonstrate that robotic procedures can effectively overcome the critical limitations of manual osteotomy, establishing a foundation for safer and more precise sacral resections.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, Accepted or publication in 2026 International Symposium on Medical Robotics (ISMR)</p></details> |
| **[Modular Safety Guardrails Are Necessary for Foundation-Model-Enabled Robots in the Real World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04056v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of foundation models (FMs) into robotics has accelerated real-world deployment, while introducing new safety challenges arising from open-ended semantic reasoning and embodied physical action. These challenges require safety notions beyond physical constraint satisfaction. In this paper, we characterize FM-enabled robot safety along three dimensions: action safety (physical feasibility and constraint compliance), decision safety (semantic and contextual appropriateness), and human-centered safety (conformance to human intent, norms, and expectations). We argue that existing approaches, including static verification, monolithic controllers, and end-to-end learned policies, are insufficient in settings where tasks, environments, and human expectations are open-ended, long-tailed, and subject to adaptation over time. To address this gap, we propose modular safety guardrails, consisting of monitoring (evaluation) and intervention layers, as an architectural foundation for comprehensive safety across the autonomy stack. Beyond modularity, we highlight possible cross-layer co-design opportunities through representation alignment and conservatism allocation to enable faster, less conservative, and more effective safety enforcement. We call on the community to explore richer guardrail modules and principled co-design strategies to advance safe real-world physical AI deployment.</p></details> |  |

Neuroendovascular surgeons determine the shape of the wire by examining the patient pre-operative images and using their experience to identify anatomy specific shapes of the wire that would facilitate reaching the target. This procedure is particularly complex in convoluted anatomical structures and is heavily dependent on the level of expertise of the surgeon. Towards enabling standardized autonomous shaping, we present a bench-top guidewire shaping robot capable of producing navigation-specific desired wire configurations. We present a model that can map the desired wire shape into robot actions, calibrated using experimental data. We show that the robot can produce clinically common tip geometries (C, S, Angled, Hook) and validate them with respect to the model-predicted shapes in 2D. Our model predicts the shape with a Root Mean Square (RMS) error of 0.56mm across all shapes when compared to the experimental results. We also demonstrate 3D tip shaping capabilities and the ability to traverse complex endoluminal navigation from the petrous Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) to the Posterior Communicating Artery (PComm).</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, ISMR2026</p></details> |

We present a Nonlinear Impedance Matching Approach (NIMA) that extends our previously validated Impedance Matching Approach (IMA) by incorporating nonlinear dynamics to accurately model and render complex tool-tissue interactions in real-time. NIMA achieves a mean absolute error of 0.01 (std 0.02 N), representing a 95% reduction compared to IMA. Additionally, NIMA eliminates haptic "kickback" by ensuring zero force is applied to the user's hand when they release the handle, enhancing both patient safety and operator comfort. By accounting for nonlinearities in tool-tissue interactions, NIMA significantly improves force fidelity, responsiveness, and precision across various surgical conditions, advancing haptic feedback systems for reliable robot-assisted surgical procedures.</p></details> |  |

Such failures rarely reflect missing motor skills; instead, they expose a limitation of imitation learning under train-test shifts, where action generation is tightly coupled to training-specific spatial configurations and task specifications. Retraining or fine-tuning to address these failures is costly and conceptually misaligned, as the required behaviors already exist but cannot be selectively adapted at test time. We propose Vision-Language Steering (VLS), a training-free framework for inference-time adaptation of frozen generative robot policies. VLS treats adaptation as an inference-time control problem, steering the sampling process of a pretrained diffusion or flow-matching policy in response to out-of-distribution observation-language inputs without modifying policy parameters. By leveraging vision-language models to synthesize trajectory-differentiable reward functions, VLS guides denoising toward action trajectories that satisfy test-time spatial and task requirements. Across simulation and real-world evaluations, VLS consistently outperforms prior steering methods, achieving a 31% improvement on CALVIN and a 13% gain on LIBERO-PRO. Real-world deployment on a Franka robot further demonstrates robust inference-time adaptation under test-time spatial and semantic shifts.

| **[How Users Understand Robot Foundation Model Performance through Task Success Rates and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03920v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot Foundation Models (RFMs) represent a promising approach to developing general-purpose home robots. Given the broad capabilities of RFMs, users will inevitably ask an RFM-based robot to perform tasks that the RFM was not trained or evaluated on. In these cases, it is crucial that users understand the risks associated with attempting novel tasks due to the relatively high cost of failure. Furthermore, an informed user who understands an RFM's capabilities will know what situations and tasks the robot can handle. In this paper, we study how non-roboticists interpret performance information from RFM evaluations. These evaluations typically report task success rate (TSR) as the primary performance metric. While TSR is intuitive to experts, it is necessary to validate whether novices also use this information as intended. Toward this end, we conducted a study in which users saw real evaluation data, including TSR, failure case descriptions, and videos from multiple published RFM research projects. The results highlight that non-experts not only use TSR in a manner consistent with expert expectations but also highly value other information types, such as failure cases that are not often reported in RFM evaluations. Furthermore, we find that users want access to both real data from previous evaluations of the RFM and estimates from the robot about how well it will do on a novel task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IJCAI 2026</p></details> |

We ask whether natural language can serve as feedback, an error-reasoning signal that helps embodied agents diagnose what went wrong and correct course. We introduce LAGEA (Language Guided Embodied Agents), a framework that turns episodic, schema-constrained reflections from a vision language model (VLM) into temporally grounded guidance for reinforcement learning. LAGEA summarizes each attempt in concise language, localizes the decisive moments in the trajectory, aligns feedback with visual state in a shared representation, and converts goal progress and feedback agreement into bounded, step-wise shaping rewards whose influence is modulated by an adaptive, failure-aware coefficient. This design yields dense signals early when exploration needs direction and gracefully recedes as competence grows. On the Meta-World MT10 and Robotic Fetch embodied manipulation benchmark, LAGEA improves average success over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 9.0% on random goals, 5.3% on fixed goals, and 17% on fetch tasks, while converging faster. These results support our hypothesis: language, when structured and grounded in time, is an effective mechanism for teaching robots to self-reflect on mistakes and make better choices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-CriTeach: LLM Self-Teaching and Self-Critiquing for Improving Robotic Planning via Automated Domain Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21543v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong promise for robotic task planning, particularly through automatic planning domain generation. Planning domains are brittle under imperfect logical states and perception noise; prior approaches largely treat generated planning domains as plan utilities, overlooking their potential as scalable sources of reasoning supervision and structured reward signals. At the same time, reasoning LLMs depend on chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision that is expensive to collect for robotic tasks, and reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in reward engineering. We propose Self-CriTeach, an LLM self-teaching and self-critiquing framework in which an LLM autonomously generates symbolic planning domains that serve a dual role: (i) enabling large-scale generation of robotic planning problem-plan pairs, and (ii) providing structured reward functions. First, the self-written domains enable large-scale generation of symbolic task plans, which are automatically transformed into extended CoT trajectories for supervised fine-tuning. Second, the self-written domains are reused as structured reward functions, providing dense feedback for reinforcement learning without manual reward engineering. This unified training pipeline yields a planning-enhanced LLM with higher planning success rates, stronger cross-task generalization, reduced inference cost, and improved robustness to imperfect logical states.</p></details> | 31 pages, 6 figures |

Most state-of-the-art VSN models are trained in simulation environments, where rendered scenes of the real world are used, at best. These approaches typically rely on raw RGB data from the virtual scenes, which limits their ability to generalize to real-world environments due to domain adaptation issues. To tackle this problem, in this work, we propose SEMNAV, a novel approach that leverages semantic segmentation as the main visual input representation of the environment to enhance the agent's perception and decision-making capabilities. By explicitly incorporating this type of high-level semantic information, our model learns robust navigation policies that improve generalization across unseen environments, both in simulated and real world settings. We also introduce the SEMNAV dataset, a newly curated dataset designed for training semantic segmentation-aware navigation models like SEMNAV. Our approach is evaluated extensively in both simulated environments and with real-world robotic platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that SEMNAV outperforms existing state-of-the-art VSN models, achieving higher success rates in the Habitat 2.0 simulation environment, using the HM3D dataset. Furthermore, our real-world experiments highlight the effectiveness of semantic segmentation in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, making our model a promising solution for practical VSN-based robotic applications. The code and datasets are accessible at https://github.com/gramuah/semnav</p></details> |  |
| **[Formal Evidence Generation for Assurance Cases for Robotic Software Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03550v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotics and Autonomous Systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, so that demonstrating their safety is essential. Assurance Cases (ACs) provide structured arguments supported by evidence, but generating and maintaining this evidence is labour-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to keep consistent as systems evolve. We present a model-based approach to systematically generating AC evidence by embedding formal verification into the assurance workflow. The approach addresses three challenges: systematically deriving formal assertions from natural language requirements using templates, orchestrating multiple formal verification tools to handle diverse property types, and integrating formal evidence production into the workflow. Leveraging RoboChart, a domain-specific modelling language with formal semantics, we combine model checking and theorem proving in our approach. Structured requirements are automatically transformed into formal assertions using predefined templates, and verification results are automatically integrated as evidence. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint.

In addition, we redesign the grasping pipeline to be more context-aware by generating grasp candidates from the global scene point cloud and subsequently filtering them using instruction-conditioned affordance masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordanceGrasp-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on benchmark datasets, and real-world robotic grasping evaluations further validate its robustness and generalization under complex language-conditioned manipulation scenarios.</p></details> | Preprint version |
| **[Investigating the Influence of Spatial Ability in Augmented Reality-assisted Robot Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03544v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmented Reality (AR) offers promising opportunities to enhance learning, but its mechanisms and effects are not yet fully understood. As learning becomes increasingly personalized, considering individual learner characteristics becomes more important. This study investigates the moderating effect of spatial ability on learning experience with AR in the context of robot programming. A between-subjects experiment ($N=71$) compared conventional robot programming to an AR-assisted approach using a head-mounted display. Participants' spatial ability was assessed using the Mental Rotation Test. The learning experience was measured through the System Usability Scale (SUS) and cognitive load. The results indicate that AR support does not significantly improve the learning experience compared to the conventional approach. However, AR appears to have a compensatory effect on the influence of spatial ability. In the control group, spatial ability was significantly positively associated with SUS scores and negatively associated with extraneous cognitive load, indicating that higher spatial ability predicts a better learning experience. In the AR condition, these relationships were not observable, suggesting that AR mitigated the disadvantage typically experienced by learners with lower spatial abilities. These findings suggest that AR can serve a compensatory function by reducing the influence of learner characteristics. Future research should further explore this compensatory role of AR to guide the design of personalized learning environments that address diverse learner needs and reduce barriers for learners with varying cognitive profiles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep-Learning-Based Control of a Decoupled Two-Segment Continuum Robot for Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03406v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manual endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is technically demanding, and existing single-segment robotic tools offer limited dexterity. These limitations motivate the development of more advanced solutions. To address this, DESectBot, a novel dual segment continuum robot with a decoupled structure and integrated surgical forceps, enabling 6 degrees of freedom (DoFs) tip dexterity for improved lesion targeting in ESD, was developed in this work. Deep learning controllers based on gated recurrent units (GRUs) for simultaneous tip position and orientation control, effectively handling the nonlinear coupling between continuum segments, were proposed. The GRU controller was benchmarked against Jacobian based inverse kinematics, model predictive control (MPC), a feedforward neural network (FNN), and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. In nested-rectangle and Lissajous trajectory tracking tasks, the GRU achieved the lowest position/orientation RMSEs: 1.11 mm/ 4.62° and 0.81 mm/ 2.59°, respectively. For orientation control at a fixed position (four target poses), the GRU attained a mean RMSE of 0.14 mm and 0.72°, outperforming all alternatives. In a peg transfer task, the GRU achieved a 100% success rate (120 success/120 attempts) with an average transfer time of 11.8s, the STD significantly outperforms novice-controlled systems. Additionally, an ex vivo ESD demonstration grasping, elevating, and resecting tissue as the scalpel completed the cut confirmed that DESectBot provides sufficient stiffness to divide thick gastric mucosa and an operative workspace adequate for large lesions.These results confirm that GRU-based control significantly enhances precision, reliability, and usability in ESD surgical training scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To ameliorate the limitations, we introduce a Reinforcement Learning-based Active Transporter Riding method (\textit{RL-ATR}), inspired by humans' utilization of personal transporters, including Segways. The \textit{RL-ATR} features a transporter riding policy and two state estimators. The policy devises adequate maneuvering strategies according to transporter-specific control dynamics, while the estimators resolve sensor ambiguities in non-inertial frames by inferring unobservable robot and transporter states. Comprehensive evaluations in simulation validate proficient command tracking abilities across various transporter-robot models and reduced energy consumption compared to legged locomotion. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to quantify individual component contributions within the \textit{RL-ATR}. This riding ability could broaden the locomotion modalities of quadruped robots, potentially expanding the operational range and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025. <a href="https://sgvr.kaist.ac.kr/~msyoon/papers/ICRA25/" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-https">Project Page</a></p></details> |

The policy adaptively adjusts the robot's posture in response to the platform's motion. The estimators infer robot and platform states based on proprioceptive sensor data. For a systematic training scheme across various platform motions, we introduce platform trajectory generation and scheduling methods. Our evaluation demonstrates superior balancing performance across multiple metrics compared to three baselines.

| **[Depth Completion in Unseen Field Robotics Environments Using Extremely Sparse Depth Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03209v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous field robots operating in unstructured environments require robust perception to ensure safe and reliable operations. Recent advances in monocular depth estimation have demonstrated the potential of low-cost cameras as depth sensors; however, their adoption in field robotics remains limited due to the absence of reliable scale cues, ambiguous or low-texture conditions, and the scarcity of large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a depth completion model that trains on synthetic data and uses extremely sparse measurements from depth sensors to predict dense metric depth in unseen field robotics environments. A synthetic dataset generation pipeline tailored to field robotics enables the creation of multiple realistic datasets for training purposes. This dataset generation approach utilizes textured 3D meshes from Structure from Motion and photorealistic rendering with novel viewpoint synthesis to simulate diverse field robotics scenarios. Our approach achieves an end-to-end latency of 53 ms per frame on a Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin, enabling real-time deployment on embedded platforms. Extensive evaluation demonstrates competitive performance across diverse real-world field robotics scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2026</p></details> |
| **[When Attention Betrays: Erasing Backdoor Attacks in Robotic Policies by Reconstructing Visual Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03153v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Downstream fine-tuning of vision-language-action (VLA) models enhances robotics, yet exposes the pipeline to backdoor risks. Attackers can pretrain VLAs on poisoned data to implant backdoors that remain stealthy but can trigger harmful behavior during inference. However, existing defenses either lack mechanistic insight into multimodal backdoors or impose prohibitive computational costs via full-model retraining. To this end, we uncover a deep-layer attention grabbing mechanism: backdoors redirect late-stage attention and form compact embedding clusters near the clean manifold. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Bera, a test-time backdoor erasure framework that detects tokens with anomalous attention via latent-space localization, masks suspicious regions using deep-layer cues, and reconstructs a trigger-free image to break the trigger-unsafe-action mapping while restoring correct behavior. Unlike prior defenses, Bera requires neither retraining of VLAs nor any changes to the training pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple embodied platforms and tasks show that Bera effectively maintains nominal performance, significantly reduces attack success rates, and consistently restores benign behavior from backdoored outputs, thereby offering a robust and practical defense mechanism for securing robotic systems.</p></details> | ICRA2026 accepted |

During the surgery, a surgeon holds tweezers and a dissector to delicately strip the blockage, but available tools for this surgery are rigid and straight, lacking distal dexterity to access into thin branches of PA. Therefore, this work presents a novel robotized dissector based on concentric push/pull robot (CPPR) structure, enabling entering deep thin branch of tortuous PA. Compared with conventional rigid dissectors, our design characterizes slenderness and dual-segment-bending dexterity. Owing to the hollow and thin-walled structure of the CPPR-based dissector as it has a slender body of 3.5mm in diameter, the central lumen accommodates two channels for irrigation and tip tool, and space for endoscopic camera's signal wire. To provide accurate surgical manipulation, optimization-based kinematics model was established, realizing a 2mm accuracy in positioning the tip tool (60mm length) under open-loop control strategy. As such, with the endoscopic camera, traditional PTE is possible to be upgraded as endoscopic PTE. Basic physic performance of the robotized dissector including stiffness, motion accuracy and maneuverability was evaluated through experiments. Surgery simulation on ex vivo porcine lung also demonstrates its dexterity and notable advantages in PTE.</p></details> |  |

A typical primary search involves quickly and thoroughly looking for victims under hazardous conditions and monitoring flammable materials. However, situational awareness in complex indoor environments and rapid stair climbing across different staircases remain the main challenges for robot-assisted primary searches. In this project, we designed a two-stage end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to optimize both navigation and locomotion. In the first stage, the quadrupeds, Unitree Go2, were trained to climb stairs in Isaac Lab's pyramid-stair terrain. In the second stage, the quadrupeds were trained to climb various realistic indoor staircases in the Isaac Lab engine, with the learned policy transferred from the previous stage. These indoor staircases are straight, L-shaped, and spiral, to support climbing tasks in complex environments. This project explores how to balance navigation and locomotion and how end-to-end RL methods can enable quadrupeds to adapt to different stair shapes. Our main contributions are: (1) A two-stage end-to-end RL framework that transfers stair-climbing skills from abstract pyramid terrain to realistic indoor stair topologies. (2) A centerline-based navigation formulation that enables unified learning of navigation and locomotion without hierarchical planning. (3) Demonstration of policy generalization across diverse staircases using only local height-map perception. (4) An empirical analysis of success, efficiency, and failure modes under increasing stair difficulty.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 43rd International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction</p></details> |

Hence, estimating 3D poses of all nearby humans, tracking their movements over time, and understanding their activities within social and environmental contexts are essential for many applications, such as autonomous driving, robot perception, robot navigation, and human-robot interaction. However, most existing 3D human pose estimation datasets primarily focus on single-person scenes or are collected in controlled laboratory environments, which restricts their relevance to real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce JRDB-Pose3D, which captures multi-human indoor and outdoor environments from a mobile robotic platform. JRDB-Pose3D provides rich 3D human pose annotations for such complex and dynamic scenes, including SMPL-based pose annotations with consistent body-shape parameters and track IDs for each individual over time. JRDB-Pose3D contains, on average, 5-10 human poses per frame, with some scenes featuring up to 35 individuals simultaneously. The proposed dataset presents unique challenges, including frequent occlusions, truncated bodies, and out-of-frame body parts, which closely reflect real-world environments. Moreover, JRDB-Pose3D inherits all available annotations from the JRDB dataset, such as 2D pose, information about social grouping, activities, and interactions, full-scene semantic masks with consistent human- and object-level tracking, and detailed annotations for each individual, such as age, gender, and race, making it a holistic dataset for a wide range of downstream perception and human-centric understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches face a dilemma: imitation policy learning demands extensive demonstrations to cover task variations, while modular methods often lack flexibility in dynamic scenes. We introduce VLBiMan, a framework that derives reusable skills from a single human example through task-aware decomposition, preserving invariant primitives as anchors while dynamically adapting adjustable components via vision-language grounding. This adaptation mechanism resolves scene ambiguities caused by background changes, object repositioning, or visual clutter without policy retraining, leveraging semantic parsing and geometric feasibility constraints. Moreover, the system inherits human-like hybrid control capabilities, enabling mixed synchronous and asynchronous use of both arms. Extensive experiments validate VLBiMan across tool-use and multi-object tasks, demonstrating: (1) a drastic reduction in demonstration requirements compared to imitation baselines, (2) compositional generalization through atomic skill splicing for long-horizon tasks, (3) robustness to novel but semantically similar objects and external disturbances, and (4) strong cross-embodiment transfer, showing that skills learned from human demonstrations can be instantiated on different robotic platforms without retraining. By bridging human priors with vision-language anchored adaptation, our work takes a step toward practical and versatile dual-arm manipulation in unstructured settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICLR 2026.

| **[Modular Isoperimetric Soft Robotic Truss for Lunar Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02915v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a large-scale robotic system designed as a lightweight, modular, and reconfigurable structure for lunar applications. The system consists of truss-like robotic triangles formed by continuous inflated fabric tubes routed through two robotic roller units and a connecting unit. A newly developed spherical joint enables up to three triangles to connect at a vertex, allowing construction of truss assemblies beyond a single octahedron. When deflated, the triangles compact to approximately the volume of the roller units, achieving a stowed-to-deployed volume ratio of 1:18.3. Upon inflation, the roller units pinch the tubes, locally reducing bending stiffness to form effective joints. Electric motors then translate the roller units along the tube, shifting the pinch point by lengthening one edge while shortening another at the same rate, thereby preserving a constant perimeter (isoperimetric). This shape-changing process requires no additional compressed air, enabling untethered operation after initial inflation. We demonstrate the system as a 12-degree-of-freedom solar array capable of tilting up to 60 degrees and sweeping 360 degrees, and as a 14-degree-of-freedom locomotion device using a step-and-slide gait. This modular, shape-adaptive system addresses key challenges for sustainable lunar operations and future space missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compact LED-Based Displacement Sensing for Robot Fingers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03481v4)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a sensor designed for integration in robot fingers, where it can provide information on the displacements induced by external contact. Our sensor uses LEDs to sense the displacement between two plates connected by a transparent elastomer; when a force is applied to the finger, the elastomer displaces and the LED signals change. We show that using LEDs as both light emitters an receivers in this context provides high sensitivity, allowing such an emitter and receiver pairs to detect very small displacements. We characterize the standalone performance of the sensor by testing the ability of a supervised learning model to predict complete force and torque data from its raw signals, and obtain a mean error between 0.05 and 0.07 N across the three directions of force applied to the finger. Our method allows for finger-size packaging with no amplification electronics, low cost manufacturing, easy integration into a complete hand, and high overload shear forces and bending torques, suggesting future applicability to complete manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Movement Primitives: Grounding Language Models in Robot Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02839v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling robots to perform novel manipulation tasks from natural language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, despite significant progress in generalized problem solving with foundational models. Large vision and language models (VLMs) are capable of processing high-dimensional input data for visual scene and language understanding, as well as decomposing tasks into a sequence of logical steps; however, they struggle to ground those steps in embodied robot motion. On the other hand, robotics foundation models output action commands, but require in-domain fine-tuning or experience before they are able to perform novel tasks successfully. At its core, there still remains the fundamental challenge of connecting abstract task reasoning with low-level motion control. To address this disconnect, we propose Language Movement Primitives (LMPs), a framework that grounds VLM reasoning in Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP) parameterization. Our key insight is that DMPs provide a small number of interpretable parameters, and VLMs can set these parameters to specify diverse, continuous, and stable trajectories. Put another way: VLMs can reason over free-form natural language task descriptions, and semantically ground their desired motions into DMPs -- bridging the gap between high-level task reasoning and low-level position and velocity control. Building on this combination of VLMs and DMPs, we formulate our LMP pipeline for zero-shot robot manipulation that effectively completes tabletop manipulation problems by generating a sequence of DMP motions. Across 20 real-world manipulation tasks, we show that LMP achieves 80% task success as compared to 31% for the best-performing baseline.

M-mode intraoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides high temporal resolution depth traces, but speckle noise, attenuation, and instrument induced shadowing often result in discontinuous or ambiguous layer interfaces that challenge anatomically consistent segmentation at deployment frame rates. We present a lightweight, topology aware M-mode segmentation pipeline based on UNeXt that incorporates anatomical topology regularization to stabilize boundary continuity and layer ordering under low signal to noise ratio conditions. The proposed system achieves end to end throughput exceeding 80 Hz measured over the complete preprocessing inference overlay pipeline on a single GPU, demonstrating practical real time guidance beyond model only timing. This operating margin provides temporal headroom to reject low quality or dropout frames while maintaining a stable effective depth update rate. Evaluation on a standard rabbit eye M-mode dataset using an established baseline protocol shows improved qualitative boundary stability compared with topology agnostic controls, while preserving deployable real time performance.</p></details> |  |

We conducted a mixed within/between experiment to investigate Sparrow's proposed ethical asymmetry hypothesis in human treatment of robots. The moral permissibility of action (MPA) was manipulated as a subject grouping variable, and virtue type (prudence, justice, courage, and temperance) was controlled as a within-subjects factor. We tested moral stimuli using an online questionnaire with Perceived Moral Permissibility of Action (PMPA) and Perceived Virtue Scores (PVS) as response measures. The PVS measure was based on an adaptation of the established Questionnaire on Cardinal Virtues (QCV), while the PMPA was based on Malle et al. [39] work. We found that the MPA significantly influenced the PMPA and perceived virtue scores. The best-fitting model to describe the relationship between PMPA and PVS was cubic, which is symmetrical in nature. Our study did not confirm Sparrow's asymmetry hypothesis. The adaptation of the QCV is expected to have utility for future studies, pending additional psychometric property assessments.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |

We introduce an improved objective that enables success in legged locomotion, humanoid motion tracking, and manipulation tasks, as well as robust sim-to-real transfer on two humanoid robots.

| **[TIC-VLA: A Think-in-Control Vision-Language-Action Model for Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02459v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots in dynamic, human-centric environments must follow language instructions while maintaining real-time reactive control. Vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising framework, but they assume temporally aligned reasoning and control, despite semantic inference being inherently delayed relative to real-time action. We introduce Think-in-Control (TIC)-VLA, a latency-aware framework that explicitly models delayed semantic reasoning during action generation. TIC-VLA defines a delayed semantic-control interface that conditions action generation on delayed vision-language semantic states and explicit latency metadata, in addition to current observations, enabling policies to compensate for asynchronous reasoning. We further propose a latency-consistent training pipeline that injects reasoning inference delays during imitation learning and online reinforcement learning, aligning training with asynchronous deployment. To support realistic evaluation, we present DynaNav, a physics-accurate, photo-realistic simulation suite for language-guided navigation in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments in simulation and on a real robot show that TIC-VLA consistently outperforms prior VLA models while maintaining robust real-time control under multi-second reasoning latency.

The two alternatives, supervised finetuning (SFT) from expert demonstrations and reinforcement learning (RL) in a software-based simulator, are limited by the amount of expert data available and the sim-to-real gap for manipulation. With the recent emergence of world models learned from real-world video-action data, we ask the question of whether training a policy in a world model can be more effective than supervised learning or software simulation in achieving better real-robot performance. We propose World-Gymnast, which performs RL finetuning of a vision-language-action (VLA) policy by rolling out the policy in an action-conditioned video world model and rewarding the rollouts with a vision-language model (VLM). On the Bridge robot setup, World-Gymnast outperforms SFT by as much as 18x and outperforms software simulator by as much as 2x. More importantly, World-Gymnast demonstrates intriguing capabilities of RL with a world model, including training on diverse language instructions and novel scenes from the world model, test-time training in a novel scene, and online iterative world model and policy improvement. Our results suggest learning a world model and training robot policies in the cloud could be the key to bridging the gap between robots that work in demonstrations and robots that can work in anyone's household.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://world-gymnast.github.io/</p></details> |

Although general locomotion policies demonstrate capabilities across broad terrain distributions, they often struggle with arbitrary and highly challenging environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose a real-to-sim-to-real framework that leverages rapid test-time training (TTT) on novel terrains, significantly enhancing the robot's capability to traverse extremely difficult geometries. We adopt a two-stage end-to-end learning paradigm: a policy is first pre-trained on diverse procedurally generated terrains, followed by rapid fine-tuning on high-fidelity meshes reconstructed from real-world captures. Specifically, we develop a feed-forward, efficient, and high-fidelity geometry reconstruction pipeline using RGB-D inputs, ensuring both speed and quality during test-time training. We demonstrate that TTT-Parkour empowers humanoid robots to master complex obstacles, including wedges, stakes, boxes, trapezoids, and narrow beams. The whole pipeline of capturing, reconstructing, and test-time training requires less than 10 minutes on most tested terrains. Extensive experiments show that the policy after test-time training exhibits robust zero-shot sim-to-real transfer capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ttt-parkour.github.io/</p></details> |

As such, they need to be tested thoroughly. Unfortunately, robot software is intrinsically hard to test compared to traditional software, mainly since the software needs to closely interact with hardware, account for uncertainty in its operational environment, handle disturbances, and act highly autonomously. However, given the large space in which robots operate, anticipating possible failures when designing tests is challenging. This paper presents a mapping study by considering robotics testing papers and relating them to the software testing theory. We consider 247 robotics testing papers and map them to software testing, discussing the state-of-the-art software testing in robotics with an illustrated example, and discuss current challenges. Forming the basis to introduce both the robotics and software engineering communities to software testing challenges. Finally, we identify open questions and lessons learned.</p></details> |  |

However, in the absence of diverse and realistic datasets, the reliable validation of algorithms remains a challenge for the research community. In this paper, we introduce MineInsight, a publicly available multi-sensor, multi-spectral dataset designed for off-road landmine detection. The dataset features 35 different targets (15 landmines and 20 commonly found objects) distributed along three distinct tracks, providing a diverse and realistic testing environment. MineInsight is, to the best of our knowledge, the first dataset to integrate dual-view sensor scans from both an Unmanned Ground Vehicle and its robotic arm, offering multiple viewpoints to mitigate occlusions and improve spatial awareness. It features two LiDARs, as well as images captured at diverse spectral ranges, including visible (RGB, monochrome), visible short-wave infrared (VIS-SWIR), and long-wave infrared (LWIR). Additionally, the dataset provides bounding boxes generated by an automated pipeline and refined with human supervision. We recorded approximately one hour of data in both daylight and nighttime conditions, resulting in around 38,000 RGB frames, 53,000 VIS-SWIR frames, and 108,000 LWIR frames. MineInsight serves as a benchmark for developing and evaluating landmine detection algorithms. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/mariomlz99/MineInsight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Contrastive Decoding for Robotic Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13255v5)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic foundation models, or generalist robot policies, hold immense potential to enable flexible, general-purpose and dexterous robotic systems. Despite their advancements, our empirical experiments reveal that existing robot policies are prone to learning spurious correlations from pre-training trajectories, adversely affecting their generalization capabilities beyond the training data. To tackle this, we propose a novel Policy Contrastive Decoding (PCD) approach, which redirects the robot policy's focus toward object-relevant visual clues by contrasting action probability distributions derived from original and object-masked visual inputs. As a training-free method, our PCD can be used as a plugin to improve different types of robot policies without needing to finetune or access model weights. We conduct extensive experiments on top of three open-source robot policies, including the autoregressive policy OpenVLA and the diffusion-based policies Octo and $π_0$. The obtained results in both simulation and real-world environments prove PCD's flexibility and effectiveness, e.g., PCD enhances the state-of-the-art policy $π_0$ by 8.9% in the simulation environment and by 108% in the real-world environment. Code and demos are publicly available at: https://koorye.github.io/PCD.</p></details> |  |

However, existing robotic spines typically lack the active compliance required to support such dynamic behaviours. We present SPARC, a compact 3-DoF sagittal-plane spine module that enables simultaneous revolute and prismatic motions within a 1.26 kg package. Using a floating-base impedance controller, we facilitate independent, task-space tuning of spinal stiffness and damping to mimic biological load-bearing strategies. Benchtop experiments confirm high-fidelity rendering of commanded impedance, with linear force-displacement error within 1.5%. Systematic locomotion simulations reveal a critical speed-dependency: while low-speed efficiency is insensitive to spinal properties, precise impedance tuning becomes indispensable for high-speed performance. Our results demonstrate that an optimally compliant spine reduces power consumption by 21% at 0.9 m/s compared to a rigid-spine baseline. This efficiency gain is mechanistically attributed to the spine's role in augmenting stride length and acting as a mechanical low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency torque fluctuations. SPARC provides an open-source platform for systematic studies of spine compliance in legged locomotion. Available at: github.com/YueWang996/sparc</p></details> |  |

Traditional mapping approaches provide accurate geometric representations but are often constrained by pre-designed symbolic vocabularies. The reliance on fixed object classes makes it impractical to handle out-of-distribution knowledge not defined at design time. Recent advances in Vision-Language Foundation Models, such as CLIP, enable open-set mapping, where objects are encoded as high-dimensional embeddings rather than fixed labels. In LIEREx, we integrate these VLFMs with established 3D Semantic Scene Graphs to enable target-directed exploration by an autonomous agent in partially unknown environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

However, when the number of labels for each task is not equal, namely imbalanced data exist, a problem may arise due to insufficient number of samples, and labeling is not very easy for mobile robots in every environment. We propose a method that can learn tasks even in the absence of the ground truth labels for some of the tasks. We also provide a detailed analysis of the proposed method. An interesting finding is related to the interaction of the tasks. We show a methodology to find out which tasks can improve the performance of other tasks. We investigate this by training the teacher network with the task outputs such as depth as inputs. We further provide empirical evidence when trained with a small amount of data. We use semantic segmentation and depth estimation tasks on different datasets, NYUDv2 and Cityscapes.</p></details> | 16 pages |

However, explicit reasoning typically incurs non-negligible inference latency, which constrains the temporal resolution required for robotic manipulation. Moreover, such reasoning is confined to the linguistic space, imposing a representational bottleneck that struggles to faithfully capture ineffable physical attributes. To mitigate these limitations, we propose LaST$_0$, a framework that enables efficient reasoning before acting through a Latent Spatio-Temporal Chain-of-Thought (CoT), capturing fine-grained physical and robotic dynamics that are often difficult to verbalize. Specifically, we introduce a token-efficient latent CoT space that models future visual dynamics, 3D structural information, and robot proprioceptive states, and further extends these representations across time to enable temporally consistent implicit reasoning trajectories. Furthermore, LaST$_0$ adopts a dual-system architecture implemented via a Mixture-of-Transformers design, where a reasoning expert conducts low-frequency latent inference and an acting expert generates high-frequency actions conditioned on robotics-oriented latent representations. To facilitate coordination, LaST$_0$ is trained with heterogeneous operation frequencies, enabling adaptive switching during deployment. Across 10 real-world tasks spanning tabletop, mobile, and dexterous hand manipulation, LaST$_0$ improves mean success rates by 13%, 14% and 14% over prior SOTA VLA methods, respectively.</p></details> |  |

The framework enables the full-state feedback estimator to estimate and compensate for uncertainties in the whole-body dynamics of the legged robots. First, we propose a novel moving horizon extended state observer (MH-ESO) to estimate uncertainties and mitigate noise in legged systems, which can be integrated into the framework for disturbance compensation. Second, we introduce a three-level whole-body disturbance rejection control framework (T-WB-DRC). Unlike the previous two-level approach, this three-level framework considers both the plan based on whole-body dynamics without uncertainties and the plan based on dynamics with uncertainties, significantly improving payload transportation, external disturbance rejection, and fault tolerance. Third, simulations of both humanoid and quadruped robots in the Gazebo simulator demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of T-WB-DRC. Finally, extensive experimental trials on a quadruped robot validate the robustness and stability of the system when using T-WB-DRC under various disturbance conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>has b...</summary><p>has been accepted for publication as a SPECIAL ISSUE paper in the IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering</p></details> |

First, we introduce a novel gait planner that incorporates dynamics to design the desired joint trajectory. In the gait design process, the 3D robot model is decoupled into two 2D models, which are then approximated as hybrid inverted pendulums (H-LIP) for trajectory planning. The gait planner operates in parallel in real time within the robot's learning environment. Second, based on this gait planner, we design three effective reward functions within a reinforcement learning framework, forming a reward composition to achieve periodic bipedal gait. This reward composition reduces the robot's learning time and enhances locomotion performance. Finally, a gait design example, along with simulation and experimental comparisons, is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Prior VLM-based manipulation pipelines are difficult to compare across different research groups' setups, and many evaluations rely on simulation, privileged state, or specially designed setups. We present AgenticLab, a model-agnostic robot agent platform and benchmark for open-world manipulation. AgenticLab provides a closed-loop agent pipeline for perception, task decomposition, online verification, and replanning. Using AgenticLab, we benchmark state-of-the-art VLM-based agents on real-robot tasks in unstructured environments. Our benchmark reveals several failure modes that offline vision-language tests (e.g., VQA and static image understanding) fail to capture, including breakdowns in multi-step grounding consistency, object grounding under occlusion and scene changes, and insufficient spatial reasoning for reliable manipulation. We will release the full hardware and software stack to support reproducible evaluation and accelerate research on general-purpose robot agents.</p></details> |  |

First, accurately modeling nonlinear dynamics remains difficult. Second, variables directly related to control objectives often cannot be directly measured during operation. Although high-cost sensors can acquire these variables during model development, their use in practical deployment is typically infeasible. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Predictive Virtual Sensor Identification (PVSID) framework that leverages temporary high-cost sensors during the modeling phase to create virtual sensors for NMPC implementation. We validate PVSID on a Two-Degree-of-Freedom (2-DoF) direct-drive robotic arm with complex joint interactions, capturing tip position via motion capture during modeling and utilize an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in NMPC. Experimental results show our NMPC with identified virtual sensors achieves precise tip trajectory tracking without requiring the motion capture system during operation. PVSID offers a practical solution for implementing optimal control in nonlinear systems where the measurement of key variables is constrained by cost or operational limitations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures.

| **[A Closed-Form Geometric Retargeting Solver for Upper Body Humanoid Robot Teleoperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01632v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retargeting human motion to robot poses is a practical approach for teleoperating bimanual humanoid robot arms, but existing methods can be suboptimal and slow, often causing undesirable motion or latency. This is due to optimizing to match robot end-effector to human hand position and orientation, which can also limit the robot's workspace to that of the human. Instead, this paper reframes retargeting as an orientation alignment problem, enabling a closed-form, geometric solution algorithm with an optimality guarantee. The key idea is to align a robot arm to a human's upper and lower arm orientations, as identified from shoulder, elbow, and wrist (SEW) keypoints; hence, the method is called SEW-Mimic. The method has fast inference (3 kHz) on standard commercial CPUs, leaving computational overhead for downstream applications; an example in this paper is a safety filter to avoid bimanual self-collision. The method suits most 7-degree-of-freedom robot arms and humanoids, and is agnostic to input keypoint source. Experiments show that SEW-Mimic outperforms other retargeting methods in computation time and accuracy. A pilot user study suggests that the method improves teleoperation task success. Preliminary analysis indicates that data collected with SEW-Mimic improves policy learning due to being smoother. SEW-Mimic is also shown to be a drop-in way to accelerate full-body humanoid retargeting. Finally, hardware demonstrations illustrate SEW-Mimic's practicality. The results emphasize the utility of SEW-Mimic as a fundamental building block for bimanual robot manipulation and humanoid robot teleoperation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://sew-mimic.com/</p></details> |

Although anomaly detection can mitigate these failures, prior methods are often incompatible with high-rate control, poorly calibrated at the extremely low false-positive rates required for practical deployment, or operate as black boxes that provide a binary stop signal without explaining why the robot drifted from nominal behavior. We present RAPT, a lightweight, self-supervised deployment-time monitor for 50Hz humanoid control. RAPT learns a probabilistic spatio-temporal manifold of nominal execution from simulation and evaluates execution-time predictive deviation as a calibrated, per-dimension signal. This yields (i) reliable online OOD detection under strict false-positive constraints and (ii) a continuous, interpretable measure of Sim-to-Real mismatch that can be tracked over time to quantify how far deployment has drifted from training. Beyond detection, we introduce an automated post-hoc root-cause analysis pipeline that combines gradient-based temporal saliency derived from RAPT's reconstruction objective with LLM-based reasoning conditioned on saliency and joint kinematics to produce semantic failure diagnoses in a zero-shot setting. We evaluate RAPT on a Unitree G1 humanoid across four complex tasks in simulation and on physical hardware. In large-scale simulation, RAPT improves True Positive Rate (TPR) by 37% over the strongest baseline at a fixed episode-level false positive rate of 0.5%. On real-world deployments, RAPT achieves a 12.5% TPR improvement and provides actionable interpretability, reaching 75% root-cause classification accuracy across 16 real-world failures using only proprioceptive data.</p></details> |  |

The robot features a shape-adjustable "ring mechanism", transitioning from a circular to an elliptical configuration to adjust wound coverage across various anatomical regions. We developed various arms for this ring mechanism with varying flexibilities to improve adaptability when applied to non-extremities of the body (abdomen, back, neck, etc.). To apply equal and constant pressure across the wound, we developed an inflatable ring and airbag balloon that are compatible with this shape-changing ring mechanism. A series of experiments focused on evaluating various ring arm configurations to characterize their bending stiffness. Subsequent experiments measured the force exerted by the airbag balloon system using a digital scale. Despite its promising performance, certain limitations related to coverage area are identified. The shape-changing effect of the device is limited to scenarios involving partially inflated or deflated airbag balloons, and cannot fully conform to complex anatomical regions. Finally, the device was tested on casualty simulation kits, where it successfully demonstrated its ability to control simulated bleeding.</p></details> |  |

Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge by adapting the network to the robot's target environment without external supervision, leveraging the large amounts of data a robot might naturally collect during long-term operation. In such settings, UDA methods can exploit multi-view consistency across the environment's map to fine-tune the model in an unsupervised fashion and mitigate domain shift. However, these approaches remain sensitive to cross-view instance-level inconsistencies. In this work, we propose a method that starts from a volumetric 3D map to generate multi-view consistent pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels using the zero-shot instance segmentation capabilities of a foundation model, enforcing instance-level coherence. The refined annotations serve as supervision for self-supervised fine-tuning, enabling the robot to adapt its perception system at deployment time. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance over state-of-the-art UDA baselines based on multi-view consistency, without requiring any ground-truth labels in the target domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ICRA 2026</p></details> |

However, existing designs primarily focus on dual-mode platforms, and some designs suffer from high mechanical complexity or low propulsion efficiency, which limits their application. In this paper, we propose a novel triphibious robot capable of aerial, terrestrial, and aquatic motion, by a minimalist design combining a quadcopter structure with two passive wheels, without extra actuators. To address inefficiency of ground-support motion (moving on land/seabed) for quadcopter based designs, we introduce an eccentric Center of Gravity (CoG) design that inherently aligns thrust with motion, enhancing efficiency without specialized mechanical transformation designs. Furthermore, to address the drastic differences in motion control caused by different fluids (air and water), we develop a unified propulsion system based on Field-Oriented Control (FOC). This method resolves torque matching issues and enables precise, rapid bidirectional thrust across different mediums. Grounded in the perspective of living condition and ground support, we analyse the robot's dynamics and propose a Hybrid Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (HNMPC)-PID control system to ensure stable multi-domain motion and seamless transitions. Experimental results validate the robot's multi-domain motion and cross-mode transition capability, along with the efficiency and adaptability of the proposed propulsion system.</p></details> |  |

To assist surgeons achieve this level of accuracy, the Improved Integrated Robotic Intraocular Snake (I2RIS) with dexterous capability has been developed. However, such flexible tendon-driven robots often suffer from hysteresis problems, which significantly challenges precise control and positioning. In particular, we observed multi-stage hysteresis phenomena in the small-scale I2RIS. In this paper, we propose an Extended Generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii (EGPI) model to increase the fitting accuracy of the hysteresis. The model incorporates a novel switching mechanism that enables it to describe multi-stage hysteresis in the regions of monotonic input. Experimental validation on I2RIS data demonstrates that the EGPI model outperforms the conventional Generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii (GPI) model in terms of RMSE, NRMSE, and MAE across multiple motor input directions. The EGPI model in our study highlights the potential in modeling multi-stage hysteresis in minimally invasive flexible robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IFAC-PapersOnLine, Vol. 59, No. 30, pp. 323-328, 2025. 5th Conference on Modeling, Estimation and Control (MECC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[UniForce: A Unified Latent Force Model for Robot Manipulation with Diverse Tactile Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01153v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Force sensing is essential for dexterous robot manipulation, but scaling force-aware policy learning is hindered by the heterogeneity of tactile sensors. Differences in sensing principles (e.g., optical vs. magnetic), form factors, and materials typically require sensor-specific data collection, calibration, and model training, thereby limiting generalisability. We propose UniForce, a novel unified tactile representation learning framework that learns a shared latent force space across diverse tactile sensors. UniForce reduces cross-sensor domain shift by jointly modeling inverse dynamics (image-to-force) and forward dynamics (force-to-image), constrained by force equilibrium and image reconstruction losses to produce force-grounded representations. To avoid reliance on expensive external force/torque (F/T) sensors, we exploit static equilibrium and collect force-paired data via direct sensor--object--sensor interactions, enabling cross-sensor alignment with contact force. The resulting universal tactile encoder can be plugged into downstream force-aware robot manipulation tasks with zero-shot transfer, without retraining or finetuning. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tactile sensors including GelSight, TacTip, and uSkin, demonstrate consistent improvements in force estimation over prior methods, and enable effective cross-sensor coordination in Vision-Tactile-Language-Action (VTLA) models for a robotic wiping task. Code and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Edge to Edge: A Flow-Inspired Scheduling Planner for Multi-Robot Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06952v3)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning is crucial in multi-robot systems, particularly in environments with numerous obstacles. While extensive research has been conducted in this field, the challenge of coordinating multiple robots to flow collectively from one side of the map to the other-such as in crossing missions through obstacle-rich spaces-has received limited attention. This paper focuses on this directional traversal scenario by introducing a real-time scheduling scheme that enables multi-robot systems to move from edge to edge, emulating the smooth and efficient flow of water. Inspired by network flow optimization, our scheme decomposes the environment into a flow-based network structure, enabling the efficient allocation of robots to paths based on real-time congestion levels. The proposed scheduling planner operates on top of existing collision avoidance algorithms, aiming to minimize overall traversal time by balancing detours and waiting times. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in achieving fast and coordinated traversal. Furthermore, real-world flight tests with ten drones validate its practical feasibility. This work contributes a flow-inspired, real-time scheduling planner tailored for directional multi-robot traversal in complex, obstacle-rich environments.

| **[Information Filtering via Variational Regularization for Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21926v2)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based visuomotor policies built on 3D visual representations have achieved strong performance in learning complex robotic skills. However, most existing methods employ an oversized denoising decoder. While increasing model capacity can improve denoising, empirical evidence suggests that it also introduces redundancy and noise in intermediate feature blocks. Crucially, we find that randomly masking backbone features at inference time (without changing training) can improve performance, confirming the presence of task-irrelevant noise in intermediate features. To this end, we propose Variational Regularization (VR), a lightweight module that imposes a timestep-conditioned Gaussian over backbone features and applies a KL-divergence regularizer, forming an adaptive information bottleneck. Extensive experiments on three simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Adroit, and MetaWorld) show that, compared to the baseline DP3, our approach improves the success rate by 6.1% on RoboTwin2.0 and by 4.1% on Adroit and MetaWorld, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Real-world experiments further demonstrate that our method performs well in practical deployments. Code will released.</p></details> |  |
| **[KAN We Flow? Advancing Robotic Manipulation with 3D Flow Matching via KAN & RWKV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01115v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based visuomotor policies excel at modeling action distributions but are inference-inefficient, since recursively denoising from noise to policy requires many steps and heavy UNet backbones, which hinders deployment on resource-constrained robots. Flow matching alleviates the sampling burden by learning a one-step vector field, yet prior implementations still inherit large UNet-style architectures. In this work, we present KAN-We-Flow, a flow-matching policy that draws on recent advances in Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) from vision to build a lightweight and highly expressive backbone for 3D manipulation. Concretely, we introduce an RWKV-KAN block: an RWKV first performs efficient time/channel mixing to propagate task context, and a subsequent GroupKAN layer applies learnable spline-based, groupwise functional mappings to perform feature-wise nonlinear calibration of the action mapping on RWKV outputs. Moreover, we introduce an Action Consistency Regularization (ACR), a lightweight auxiliary loss that enforces alignment between predicted action trajectories and expert demonstrations via Euler extrapolation, providing additional supervision to stabilize training and improve policy precision. Without resorting to large UNets, our design reduces parameters by 86.8\%, maintains fast runtime, and achieves state-of-the-art success rates on Adroit, Meta-World, and DexArt benchmarks.

| **[A Systematic Study of Data Modalities and Strategies for Co-training Large Behavior Models for Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01067v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large behavior models have shown strong dexterous manipulation capabilities by extending imitation learning to large-scale training on multi-task robot data, yet their generalization remains limited by the insufficient robot data coverage. To expand this coverage without costly additional data collection, recent work relies on co-training: jointly learning from target robot data and heterogeneous data modalities. However, how different co-training data modalities and strategies affect policy performance remains poorly understood. We present a large-scale empirical study examining five co-training data modalities: standard vision-language data, dense language annotations for robot trajectories, cross-embodiment robot data, human videos, and discrete robot action tokens across single- and multi-phase training strategies. Our study leverages 4,000 hours of robot and human manipulation data and 50M vision-language samples to train vision-language-action policies. We evaluate 89 policies over 58,000 simulation rollouts and 2,835 real-world rollouts. Our results show that co-training with forms of vision-language and cross-embodiment robot data substantially improves generalization to distribution shifts, unseen tasks, and language following, while discrete action token variants yield no significant benefits. Combining effective modalities produces cumulative gains and enables rapid adaptation to unseen long-horizon dexterous tasks via fine-tuning. Training exclusively on robot data degrades the visiolinguistic understanding of the vision-language model backbone, while co-training with effective modalities restores these capabilities. Explicitly conditioning action generation on chain-of-thought traces learned from co-training data does not improve performance in our simulation benchmark. Together, these results provide practical guidance for building scalable generalist robot policies.</p></details> |  |

MOBIUS features four limbs, two 6-DoF arms with two-finger grippers for manipulation and climbing, and two 4-DoF legs for locomotion--enabling smooth transitions across diverse terrains without reconfiguration. A hybrid control architecture combines reinforcement learning for locomotion and force control for compliant contact interactions during manipulation. A high-level MIQCP planner autonomously selects locomotion modes to balance stability and energy efficiency. Hardware experiments demonstrate robust gait transitions, dynamic climbing, and full-body load support via pinch grasp. Overall, MOBIUS demonstrates the importance of tight integration between morphology, high-level planning, and control to enable mobile loco-manipulation and grasping, substantially expanding its interaction capabilities, workspace, and traversability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Colla...</summary><p>Collaborative work between the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory (RoMeLa) and Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL)</p></details> |
| **[CLAMP: Contrastive Learning for 3D Multi-View Action-Conditioned Robotic Manipulation Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00937v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging pre-trained 2D image representations in behavior cloning policies has achieved great success and has become a standard approach for robotic manipulation. However, such representations fail to capture the 3D spatial information about objects and scenes that is essential for precise manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Learning for 3D Multi-View Action-Conditioned Robotic Manipulation Pretraining (CLAMP), a novel 3D pre-training framework that utilizes point clouds and robot actions. From the merged point cloud computed from RGB-D images and camera extrinsics, we re-render multi-view four-channel image observations with depth and 3D coordinates, including dynamic wrist views, to provide clearer views of target objects for high-precision manipulation tasks. The pre-trained encoders learn to associate the 3D geometric and positional information of objects with robot action patterns via contrastive learning on large-scale simulated robot trajectories. During encoder pre-training, we pre-train a Diffusion Policy to initialize the policy weights for fine-tuning, which is essential for improving fine-tuning sample efficiency and performance. After pre-training, we fine-tune the policy on a limited amount of task demonstrations using the learned image and action representations. We demonstrate that this pre-training and fine-tuning design substantially improves learning efficiency and policy performance on unseen tasks. Furthermore, we show that CLAMP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across six simulated tasks and five real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |

Green-VLA follows a five stage curriculum: (L0) foundational VLMs, (L1) multimodal grounding, (R0) multi-embodiment pretraining, (R1) embodiment-specific adaptation, and (R2) reinforcement-learning (RL) policy alignment. We couple a scalable data-processing pipeline (3,000 hours of demonstrations) with temporal alignment and quality filtering, and use a unified, embodiment-aware action interface enabling a single policy to control humanoids, mobile manipulators, and fixed-base arms. At inference, the VLA controller is enhanced with episode-progress prediction, out-of-distribution detection, and joint-prediction-based guidance to improve safety and precise target selection. Experiments on Simpler BRIDGE WidowX and CALVIN ABC-D, as well as real-robot evaluations, show strong generalization and performance gains from RL alignment in success rate, robustness, and long-horizon efficiency.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |

To address this, we created a benchmark and organized the ICRA 2024 Cloth Competition, a unique head-to-head evaluation focused on grasp pose selection for in-air robotic cloth unfolding. Eleven diverse teams participated in the competition, utilizing our publicly released dataset of real-world robotic cloth unfolding attempts and a variety of methods to design their unfolding approaches. Afterwards, we also expanded our dataset with 176 competition evaluation trials, resulting in a dataset of 679 unfolding demonstrations across 34 garments. Analysis of the competition results revealed insights about the trade-off between grasp success and coverage, the surprisingly strong achievements of hand-engineered methods and a significant discrepancy between competition performance and prior work, underscoring the importance of independent, out-of-the-lab evaluation in robotic cloth manipulation. The associated dataset is a valuable resource for developing and evaluating grasp selection methods, particularly for learning-based approaches. We hope that our benchmark, dataset and competition results can serve as a foundation for future benchmarks and drive further progress in data-driven robotic cloth manipulation. The dataset and benchmarking code are available at https://airo.ugent.be/cloth_competition.</p></details> | <details><summary>The I...</summary><p>The International Journal of Robotics Research. 2026;0(0).

| **[Factored Reasoning with Inner Speech and Persistent Memory for Evidence-Grounded Human-Robot Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00675v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dialogue-based human-robot interaction requires robot cognitive assistants to maintain persistent user context, recover from underspecified requests, and ground responses in external evidence, while keeping intermediate decisions verifiable. In this paper we introduce JANUS, a cognitive architecture for assistive robots that models interaction as a partially observable Markov decision process and realizes control as a factored controller with typed interfaces. To this aim, Janus (i) decomposes the overall behavior into specialized modules, related to scope detection, intent recognition, memory, inner speech, query generation, and outer speech, and (ii) exposes explicit policies for information sufficiency, execution readiness, and tool grounding. A dedicated memory agent maintains a bounded recent-history buffer, a compact core memory, and an archival store with semantic retrieval, coupled through controlled consolidation and revision policies. Models inspired by the notion of inner speech in cognitive theories provide a control-oriented internal textual flow that validates parameter completeness and triggers clarification before grounding, while a faithfulness constraint ties robot-to-human claims to an evidence bundle combining working context and retrieved tool outputs. We evaluate JANUS through module-level unit tests in a dietary assistance domain grounded on a knowledge graph, reporting high agreement with curated references and practical latency profiles. These results support factored reasoning as a promising path to scalable, auditable, and evidence-grounded robot assistance over extended interaction horizons.</p></details> |  |
| **[ConLA: Contrastive Latent Action Learning from Human Videos for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00557v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models achieve preliminary generalization through pretraining on large scale robot teleoperation datasets. However, acquiring datasets that comprehensively cover diverse tasks and environments is extremely costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, human demonstration videos offer a rich and scalable source of diverse scenes and manipulation behaviors, yet their lack of explicit action supervision hinders direct utilization. Prior work leverages VQ-VAE based frameworks to learn latent actions from human videos in an unsupervised manner. Nevertheless, since the training objective primarily focuses on reconstructing visual appearances rather than capturing inter-frame dynamics, the learned representations tend to rely on spurious visual cues, leading to shortcut learning and entangled latent representations that hinder transferability. To address this, we propose ConLA, an unsupervised pretraining framework for learning robotic policies from human videos. ConLA introduces a contrastive disentanglement mechanism that leverages action category priors and temporal cues to isolate motion dynamics from visual content, effectively mitigating shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show that ConLA achieves strong performance across diverse benchmarks. Notably, by pretraining solely on human videos, our method for the first time surpasses the performance obtained with real robot trajectory pretraining, highlighting its ability to extract pure and semantically consistent latent action representations for scalable robot learning.</p></details> |  |

However, their movements within the intimate near-body space raise unresolved challenges for perceived safety, user control, and trust. In this paper, we present results from a Wizard-of-Oz study (n=18), where participants completed near-body collaboration tasks with SRLs to explore these challenges. We collected qualitative data through think-aloud protocols and semi-structured interviews, complemented by physiological signals and post-task ratings. Findings indicate that greater autonomy did not inherently enhance perceived safety or trust. Instead, participants identified near-body zones and paired them with clear coordination rules. They also expressed expectations for how different arm components should behave, shaping preferences around autonomy, perceived safety, and trust. Building on these insights, we introduce SRL Proxemics, a zone- and segment-level design framework showing that autonomy is not monolithic: perceived safety hinges on spatially calibrated, legible behaviors, not higher autonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CHI 2026.

We introduce ZEST (Zero-shot Embodied Skill Transfer), a streamlined motion-imitation framework that trains policies via reinforcement learning from diverse sources -- high-fidelity motion capture, noisy monocular video, and non-physics-constrained animation -- and deploys them to hardware zero-shot. ZEST generalizes across behaviors and platforms while avoiding contact labels, reference or observation windows, state estimators, and extensive reward shaping. Its training pipeline combines adaptive sampling, which focuses training on difficult motion segments, and an automatic curriculum using a model-based assistive wrench, together enabling dynamic, long-horizon maneuvers. We further provide a procedure for selecting joint-level gains from approximate analytical armature values for closed-chain actuators, along with a refined model of actuators. Trained entirely in simulation with moderate domain randomization, ZEST demonstrates remarkable generality. On Boston Dynamics' Atlas humanoid, ZEST learns dynamic, multi-contact skills (e.g., army crawl, breakdancing) from motion capture. It transfers expressive dance and scene-interaction skills, such as box-climbing, directly from videos to Atlas and the Unitree G1. Furthermore, it extends across morphologies to the Spot quadruped, enabling acrobatics, such as a continuous backflip, through animation. Together, these results demonstrate robust zero-shot deployment across heterogeneous data sources and embodiments, establishing ZEST as a scalable interface between biological movements and their robotic counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[RVDebloater: Mode-based Adaptive Firmware Debloating for Robotic Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00270v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the number of embedded devices grows and their functional requirements increase, embedded firmware is becoming increasingly larger, thereby expanding its attack surface. Despite the increase in firmware size, many embedded devices, such as robotic vehicles (RVs), operate in distinct modes, each requiring only a small subset of the firmware code at runtime. We refer to such devices as mode-based embedded devices. Debloating is an approach to reduce attack surfaces by removing or restricting unneeded code, but existing techniques suffer from significant limitations, such as coarse granularity and irreversible code removal, limiting their applicability. To address these limitations, we propose RVDebloater, a novel adaptive debloating technique for mode-based embedded devices that automatically identifies unneeded firmware code for each mode using either static or dynamic analysis, and dynamically debloats the firmware for each mode at the function level at runtime. RVDebloater introduces a new software-based enforcement approach that supports diverse mode-based embedded devices. We implemented RVDebloater using the LLVM compiler and evaluated its efficiency and effectiveness on six different RVs, including both simulated and real ones, with different real-world missions. We find that device requirements change throughout its lifetime for each mode, and that many critical firmware functions can be restricted in other modes, with an average of 85% of functions not being required. The results showed that none of the missions failed after debloating with RVDebloater, indicating that it neither incurred false positives nor false negatives. Further, RVDebloater prunes the firmware call graph by an average of 45% across different firmware. Finally, RVDebloater incurred an average performance overhead of 3.9% and memory overhead of 4% (approximately 0.25 MB) on real RVs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporally Coherent Imitation Learning via Latent Action Flow Matching for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23087v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning long-horizon robotic manipulation requires jointly achieving expressive behavior modeling, real-time inference, and stable execution, which remains challenging for existing generative policies. Diffusion-based approaches provide strong modeling capacity but typically incur high inference latency, while flow matching enables fast one-step generation yet often leads to unstable execution when applied directly in the raw action space. We propose LG-Flow Policy, a trajectory-level imitation learning framework that performs flow matching in a continuous latent action space. By encoding action sequences into temporally regularized latent trajectories and learning an explicit latent-space flow, the proposed approach decouples global motion structure from low-level control noise, resulting in smooth and reliable long-horizon execution. LG-Flow Policy further incorporates geometry-aware point cloud conditioning and execution-time multimodal modulation, with visual cues evaluated as a representative modality in real-world settings. Experimental results in simulation and on physical robot platforms demonstrate that LG-Flow Policy achieves near single-step inference, substantially improves trajectory smoothness and task success over flow-based baselines operating in the raw action space, and remains significantly more efficient than diffusion-based policies.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

This restricts the deployment scale and requires near-continuous low-latency communication between the operator and the robot. We present MOSAIC: a scalable autonomy framework for multi-robot scientific exploration using a unified mission abstraction based on Points of Interest (POIs) and multiple layers of autonomy, enabling supervision by a single operator. The framework dynamically allocates exploration and measurement tasks based on each robot's capabilities, leveraging team-level redundancy and specialization to enable continuous operation. We validated the framework in a space-analog field experiment emulating a lunar prospecting scenario, involving a heterogeneous team of five robots and a single operator. Despite the complete failure of one robot during the mission, the team completed 82.3% of assigned tasks at an Autonomy Ratio of 86%, while the operator workload remained at only 78.2%. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables robust, scalable multi-robot scientific exploration with limited operator intervention. We further derive practical lessons learned in robot interoperability, networking architecture, team composition, and operator workload management to inform future multi-robot exploration missions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
