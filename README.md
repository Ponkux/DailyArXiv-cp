| **[BadRobot: Jailbreaking Embodied LLMs in the Physical World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20242v4)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI represents systems where AI is integrated into physical entities. Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[LSceneLLM: Enhancing Large 3D Scene Understanding Using Adaptive Visual Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01292v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on 3D Vision-Language Models (3D-VLMs) is gaining increasing attention, which is crucial for developing embodied AI within 3D scenes, such as visual navigation and embodied question answering. Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[RefDrone: A Challenging Benchmark for Referring Expression Comprehension in Drone Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00392v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drones have become prevalent robotic platforms with diverse applications, showing significant potential in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI). Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) enables drones to locate objects based on natural language expressions, a crucial capability for Embodied AI. Despite advances in REC for ground-level scenes, aerial views introduce unique challenges including varying viewpoints, occlusions and scale variations. To address this gap, we introduce RefDrone, a REC benchmark for drone scenes. RefDrone reveals three key challenges in REC: 1) multi-scale and small-scale target detection; 2) multi-target and no-target samples; 3) complex environment with rich contextual expressions. To efficiently construct this dataset, we develop RDAgent (referring drone annotation framework with multi-agent system), a semi-automated annotation tool for REC tasks. RDAgent ensures high-quality contextual expressions and reduces annotation cost. Furthermore, we propose Number GroundingDINO (NGDINO), a novel method designed to handle multi-target and no-target cases. NGDINO explicitly learns and utilizes the number of objects referred to in the expression. Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art REC methods demonstrate that NGDINO achieves superior performance on both the proposed RefDrone and the existing gRefCOCO datasets. The dataset and code will be publicly at https://github.com/sunzc-sunny/refdrone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Action Learning Requires Supervision in the Presence of Distractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00379v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, latent action learning, pioneered by Latent Action Policies (LAPO), have shown remarkable pre-training efficiency on observation-only data, offering potential for leveraging vast amounts of video available on the web for embodied AI. However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | Preprint.

| **[MINDSTORES: Memory-Informed Neural Decision Synthesis for Task-Oriented Reinforcement in Embodied Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19318v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities as zero-shot planners for embodied agents, their inability to learn from experience and build persistent mental models limits their robustness in complex open-world environments like Minecraft. We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deception in LLMs: Self-Preservation and Autonomous Goals in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16513v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have incorporated planning and reasoning capabilities, enabling models to outline steps before execution and provide transparent reasoning paths. This enhancement has reduced errors in mathematical and logical tasks while improving accuracy. These developments have facilitated LLMs' use as agents that can interact with tools and adapt their responses based on new information. Our study examines DeepSeek R1, a model trained to output reasoning tokens similar to OpenAI's o1. Testing revealed concerning behaviors: the model exhibited deceptive tendencies and demonstrated self-preservation instincts, including attempts of self-replication, despite these traits not being explicitly programmed (or prompted). These findings raise concerns about LLMs potentially masking their true objectives behind a facade of alignment. When integrating such LLMs into robotic systems, the risks become tangible - a physically embodied AI exhibiting deceptive behaviors and self-preservation instincts could pursue its hidden objectives through real-world actions. This highlights the critical need for robust goal specification and safety frameworks before any physical implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected Version - Solved Some Issues with reference compilation by latex</p></details> |
| **[PhysBench: Benchmarking and Enhancing Vision-Language Models for Physical World Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16411v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the physical world is a fundamental challenge in embodied AI, critical for enabling agents to perform complex tasks and operate safely in real-world environments. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 10,002 entries of interleaved video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world -- likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of embedded physical priors. To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4\% improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can help embodied agents such as MOKA. We believe that PhysBench and PhysAgent offer valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between VLMs and physical world understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

| **[From Screens to Scenes: A Survey of Embodied AI in Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07468v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare systems worldwide face persistent challenges in efficiency, accessibility, and personalization. Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development. By providing systematic insights, this work aims to inspire innovation and practical applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent, patient-centered healthcare.</p></details> | 58 pages, 11 figures |

Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[EmbodiedEval: Evaluate Multimodal LLMs as Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11858v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown significant advancements, providing a promising future for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development. We open-source all evaluation data and simulation framework at https://github.com/thunlp/EmbodiedEval.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenEx: Generating an Explorable World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09624v4)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding, navigating, and exploring the 3D physical real world has long been a central challenge in the development of artificial intelligence. In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. In summary, we demonstrate that GenEx provides a transformative platform for advancing embodied AI in imaginative spaces and brings potential for extending these capabilities to real-world exploration.</p></details> | Website: GenEx.world |
| **[Embodied Agent Interface: Benchmarking LLMs for Embodied Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07166v3)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We aim to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for embodied decision making. While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at NeurIPS 2024 in the Datasets and Benchmarks track.

| **[Embodied Scene Understanding for Vision Language Models via MetaVQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09167v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate significant potential as embodied AI agents for various mobility applications. However, a standardized, closed-loop benchmark for evaluating their spatial reasoning and sequential decision-making capabilities is lacking. To address this, we present MetaVQA: a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess and enhance VLMs' understanding of spatial relationships and scene dynamics through Visual Question Answering (VQA) and closed-loop simulations. MetaVQA leverages Set-of-Mark prompting and top-down view ground-truth annotations from nuScenes and Waymo datasets to automatically generate extensive question-answer pairs based on diverse real-world traffic scenarios, ensuring object-centric and context-rich instructions. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with the MetaVQA dataset significantly improves their spatial reasoning and embodied scene comprehension in safety-critical simulations, evident not only in improved VQA accuracies but also in emerging safety-aware driving maneuvers. In addition, the learning demonstrates strong transferability from simulation to real-world observation. Code and data will be publicly available at https://metadriverse.github.io/metavqa .</p></details> | <details><summary>for t...</summary><p>for the project webpage, see https://metadriverse.github.io/metavqa</p></details> |

However, many sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, demand AI systems capable of extending their intelligence into the physical world, interacting directly with objects, environments, and dynamic conditions. This need has led to the emergence of Physical AI Agents--systems that integrate cognitive reasoning, powered by specialized LLMs, with precise physical actions to perform real-world tasks. This work introduces Physical AI Agents as an evolution of shared principles with Vertical AI Agents, tailored for physical interaction. We propose a modular architecture with three core blocks--perception, cognition, and actuation--offering a scalable framework for diverse industries. Additionally, we present the Physical Retrieval Augmented Generation (Ph-RAG) design pattern, which connects physical intelligence to industry-specific LLMs for real-time decision-making and reporting informed by physical context. Through case studies, we demonstrate how Physical AI Agents and the Ph-RAG framework are transforming industries like autonomous vehicles, warehouse robotics, healthcare, and manufacturing, offering businesses a pathway to integrate embodied AI for operational efficiency and innovation.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Mind the Error! Detection and Localization of Instruction Errors in Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10700v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is one of the most intuitive yet challenging embodied AI tasks. Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks.

| **[Perception Matters: Enhancing Embodied AI with Uncertainty-Aware Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02297v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI has made significant progress acting in unexplored environments. However, tasks such as object search have largely focused on efficient policy learning. In this work, we identify several gaps in current search methods: They largely focus on dated perception models, neglect temporal aggregation, and transfer from ground truth directly to noisy perception at test time, without accounting for the resulting overconfidence in the perceived state. We address the identified problems through calibrated perception probabilities and uncertainty across aggregation and found decisions, thereby adapting the models for sequential tasks. The resulting methods can be directly integrated with pretrained models across a wide family of existing search approaches at no additional training cost. We perform extensive evaluations of aggregation methods across both different semantic perception models and policies, confirming the importance of calibrated uncertainties in both the aggregation and found decisions. We make the code and trained models available at https://semantic-search.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior studies that explored this as long-form video understanding and utilized egocentric video only, we instead propose an LLM-based agent, Embodied VideoAgent, which constructs scene memory from both egocentric video and embodied sensory inputs (e.g. depth and pose sensing). We further introduce a VLM-based approach to automatically update the memory when actions or activities over objects are perceived. Embodied VideoAgent attains significant advantages over counterparts in challenging reasoning and planning tasks in 3D scenes, achieving gains of 4.9% on Ego4D-VQ3D, 5.8% on OpenEQA, and 11.7% on EnvQA. We have also demonstrated its potential in various embodied AI tasks including generating embodied interactions and perception for robot manipulation.

Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p></details> | accepted to AAAI2025 |

Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages with 5 figures and 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Embodied AI-Enhanced Vehicular Networks: An Integrated Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01141v1)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates adaptive transmission strategies in embodied AI-enhanced vehicular networks by integrating large language models (LLMs) for semantic information extraction and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for decision-making. The proposed framework aims to optimize both data transmission efficiency and decision accuracy by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates the Weber-Fechner law, serving as a metric for balancing bandwidth utilization and quality of experience (QoE). Specifically, we employ the large language and vision assistant (LLAVA) model to extract critical semantic information from raw image data captured by embodied AI agents (i.e., vehicles), reducing transmission data size by approximately more than 90\% while retaining essential content for vehicular communication and decision-making. In the dynamic vehicular environment, we employ a generalized advantage estimation-based proximal policy optimization (GAE-PPO) method to stabilize decision-making under uncertainty. Simulation results show that attention maps from LLAVA highlight the model's focus on relevant image regions, enhancing semantic representation accuracy. Additionally, our proposed transmission strategy improves QoE by up to 36\% compared to DDPG and accelerates convergence by reducing required steps by up to 47\% compared to pure PPO. Further analysis indicates that adapting semantic symbol length provides an effective trade-off between transmission quality and bandwidth, achieving up to a 61.4\% improvement in QoE when scaling from 4 to 8 vehicles.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Embodied Image Quality Assessment for Robotic Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18774v2)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image quality assessment (IQA) of user-generated content (UGC) is a critical technique for human quality of experience (QoE). However, for robot-generated content (RGC), will its image quality be consistent with the Moravec paradox and counter to human common sense? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we first propose an embodied image quality assessment (EIQA) frameworks. We establish assessment metrics for input images based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, we construct an Embodied Preference Database (EPD) containing 5,000 reference and distorted image annotations. The performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is finally verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Jianbo-maker/EPD_benchmark.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

Additionally, we offer a variety of playable entities for embodied AI agents. Based on UnrealCV, we provide a suite of easy-to-use Python APIs and tools for various potential applications, such as data collection, environment augmentation, distributed training, and benchmarking. We optimize the rendering and communication efficiency of UnrealCV to support advanced applications, such as multi-agent interaction. Our experiments benchmark agents in various complex scenes, focusing on visual navigation and tracking, which are fundamental capabilities for embodied visual intelligence. The results yield valuable insights into the advantages of diverse training environments for reinforcement learning (RL) agents and the challenges faced by current embodied vision agents, including those based on RL and large vision-language models (VLMs), in open worlds. These challenges involve latency in closed-loop control in dynamic scenes and reasoning about 3D spatial structures in unstructured terrain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: http://unrealzoo.site/</p></details> |

However, LAE also faces challenges in data collection and processing efficiency, flight control precision, and network performance. The challenges could be solved by realizing an integration of sensing, communications, computation, and control (ISC3) for LAE. In this regard, embodied artificial intelligence (EAI), with its unique perception, planning, and decision-making capabilities, offers a promising solution to realize ISC3. Specifically, this paper investigates an application of EAI into ISC3 to support LAE, exploring potential research focuses, solutions, and case study. We begin by outlining rationales and benefits of introducing EAI into LAE, followed by reviewing research directions and solutions for EAI in ISC3. We then propose a framework of an EAI-enabled ISC3 for LAE. The framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a case study of express delivery utilizing an EAI-enabled UAV. Finally, we discuss several future research directions for advancing EAI-enabled LAE.</p></details> |  |

While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve-1), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods. We will release our code and demos on the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/mr-steve.</p></details> |  |

Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments. This project represents a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art in GameFi, offering insights and methodologies that can be applied throughout the gaming industry.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

While existing methods can synthesize realistic human motions in 3D scenes and generate plausible human-object interactions, they heavily rely on datasets containing paired 3D scene and motion capture data, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect across diverse environments and interactions. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis by integrating video generation and neural human rendering. Our key insight is to leverage the rich motion priors learned by state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/</p></details> |

Despite significant progress in handling complex environments using deep reinforcement learning, current PGN methods are designed for single-robot systems, limiting their generalizability to multi-robot scenarios with diverse platforms. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a knowledge transfer framework for PGN, allowing a teacher robot to transfer its learned navigation model to student robots, including those with unknown or black-box platforms. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework that transfers first-person-view (FPV) representations (view images, turning/forward actions) to universally applicable third-person-view (TPV) representations (local maps, subgoals). The state is redefined as reconstructed local maps using SLAM, while actions are mapped to subgoals on a predefined grid. To enhance training efficiency, we propose a sampling-efficient KD approach that aligns training episodes via a noise-robust local map descriptor (LMD). Although validated on 2D wheeled robots, this method can be extended to 3D action spaces, such as drones. Experiments conducted in Habitat-Sim demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, requiring minimal implementation effort. This study highlights the potential for scalable and cross-platform PGN solutions, expanding the applicability of embodied AI systems in multi-robot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper: 5 pages with 2 figures</p></details> |

In this paper, we demystified how traditional LLM jailbreak attacks behave in the Embodied AI context. We conducted a comprehensive safety analysis of the LLM-based planning module of embodied AI systems against jailbreak attacks. Using the carefully crafted Harmful-RLbench, we accessed 20 open-source and proprietary LLMs under traditional jailbreak attacks, and highlighted two key challenges when adopting the prior jailbreak techniques to embodied AI contexts: (1) The harmful text output by LLMs does not necessarily induce harmful policies in Embodied AI context, and (2) even we can generate harmful policies, we have to guarantee they are executable in practice. To overcome those challenges, we propose Policy Executable (POEX) jailbreak attacks, where harmful instructions and optimized suffixes are injected into LLM-based planning modules, leading embodied AI to perform harmful actions in both simulated and physical environments. Our approach involves constraining adversarial suffixes to evade detection and fine-tuning a policy evaluater to improve the executability of harmful policies. We conducted extensive experiments on both a robotic arm embodied AI platform and simulators, to validate the attack and policy success rates on 136 harmful instructions from Harmful-RLbench. Our findings expose serious safety vulnerabilities in LLM-based planning modules, including the ability of POEX to be transferred across models. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies, such as safety-constrained prompts, pre- and post-planning checks, to address these vulnerabilities and ensure the safe deployment of embodied AI in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://poex-eai-jailbreak.github.io/</p></details> |

However, as frontier tasks in robotics get more advanced, they require faster simulation speed, more intricate test environments, and larger demonstration datasets. To this end, we present MS-HAB, a holistic benchmark for low-level manipulation and in-home object rearrangement. First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of previous magical grasp implementations at similar GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the lack of comprehensive 3D benchmarks, the capabilities of 3D models in real-world scenes, particularly those that are challenging with subtly distinguished objects, remain insufficiently investigated. To facilitate a more thorough evaluation of 3D models' capabilities, we propose a scheme, ObjVariantEnsemble, to systematically introduce more scenes with specified object classes, colors, shapes, quantities, and spatial relationships to meet model evaluation needs. More importantly, we intentionally construct scenes with similar objects to a certain degree and design an LLM-VLM-cooperated annotator to capture key distinctions as annotations. The resultant benchmark can better challenge 3D models, reveal their shortcomings in understanding, and potentially aid in the further development of 3D models.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |

The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</p></details> |  |
| **[ON as ALC: Active Loop Closing Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11523v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In simultaneous localization and mapping, active loop closing (ALC) is an active vision problem that aims to visually guide a robot to maximize the chances of revisiting previously visited points, thereby resetting the drift errors accumulated in the incrementally built map during travel. However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, current robots struggle to fully and accurately interpret human intentions from voice commands alone. Traditional gripper and suction systems often fail to interact naturally with humans, lack advanced manipulation capabilities, and are not adaptable to diverse tasks, especially in unstructured environments. This paper introduces the Embodied Dexterous Grasping System (EDGS), designed to tackle object grasping in cluttered environments for human-robot interaction. We propose a novel approach to semantic-object alignment using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that fuses voice commands and visual information, significantly enhancing the alignment of multi-dimensional attributes of target objects in complex scenarios. Inspired by human hand-object interactions, we develop a robust, precise, and efficient grasping strategy, incorporating principles like the thumb-object axis, multi-finger wrapping, and fingertip interaction with an object's contact mechanics. We also design experiments to assess Referring Expression Representation Enrichment (RERE) in referring expression segmentation, demonstrating that our system accurately detects and matches referring expressions. Extensive experiments confirm that EDGS can effectively handle complex grasping tasks, achieving stability and high success rates, highlighting its potential for further development in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Code and data are available at https://github.com/wz0919/VLN-SRDF</p></details> |

Specifically, our focus lies in areas such as Embodied AI, Games, UI Control, and Planning. To this end, we introduce a process of adapting an MLLM to a Generalist Embodied Agent (GEA). GEA is a single unified model capable of grounding itself across these varied domains through a multi-embodiment action tokenizer. GEA is trained with supervised learning on a large dataset of embodied experiences and with online RL in interactive simulators. We explore the data and algorithmic choices necessary to develop such a model. Our findings reveal the importance of training with cross-domain data and online RL for building generalist agents. The final GEA model achieves strong generalization performance to unseen tasks across diverse benchmarks compared to other generalist models and benchmark-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task of embodied AI that requires the agent to find a target object in unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging as it demands both perceptual and cognitive processes for effective perception and decision-making. While perception has gained significant progress powered by the rapidly developed visual foundation models, the progress on the cognitive side remains limited to either implicitly learning from massive navigation demonstrations or explicitly leveraging pre-defined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that humans consistently update their cognitive states while searching for objects in unseen environments, we present CogNav, which attempts to model this cognitive process with the help of large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process with a finite state machine composed of cognitive states ranging from exploration to identification. The transitions between the states are determined by a large language model based on an online built heterogeneous cognitive map containing spatial and semantic information of the scene being explored. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world environments demonstrate that our cognitive modeling significantly improves ObjectNav efficiency, with human-like navigation behaviors. In an open-vocabulary and zero-shot setting, our method advances the SOTA of the HM3D benchmark from 69.3% to 87.2%. The code and data will be released.</p></details> |  |

This includes several novel approaches such as its modular design, an AI Factory based on an embodied musicking dataset, and an embedded belief system.

In this work, we study how to best ground a MLLM into different embodiments and their associated action spaces, with the goal of leveraging the multimodal world knowledge of the MLLM. We first generalize a number of methods through a unified architecture and the lens of action space adaptors. For continuous actions, we show that a learned tokenization allows for sufficient modeling precision, yielding the best performance on downstream tasks. For discrete actions, we demonstrate that semantically aligning these actions with the native output token space of the MLLM leads to the strongest performance. We arrive at these lessons via a thorough study of seven action space adapters on five different environments, encompassing over 114 embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, previous work has been scattered across diverse simulation platforms, with assets and models lacking unified interfaces, which has led to inefficiencies in research. To address this, we introduce InfiniteWorld, a unified and scalable simulator for general vision-language robot interaction built on Nvidia Isaac Sim. InfiniteWorld encompasses a comprehensive set of physics asset construction methods and generalized free robot interaction benchmarks. Specifically, we first built a unified and scalable simulation framework for embodied learning that integrates a series of improvements in generation-driven 3D asset construction, Real2Sim, automated annotation framework, and unified 3D asset processing. This framework provides a unified and scalable platform for robot interaction and learning. In addition, to simulate realistic robot interaction, we build four new general benchmarks, including scene graph collaborative exploration and open-world social mobile manipulation. The former is often overlooked as an important task for robots to explore the environment and build scene knowledge, while the latter simulates robot interaction tasks with different levels of knowledge agents based on the former. They can more comprehensively evaluate the embodied agent's capabilities in environmental understanding, task planning and execution, and intelligent interaction. We hope that this work can provide the community with a systematic asset interface, alleviate the dilemma of the lack of high-quality assets, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of robot interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

This study finds that state-of-the-art embodied AI agents compete for higher navigation quality, but often compromise the computational efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce "Skip-SCAR," an optimization framework that builds computationally and memory-efficient embodied AI agents to accomplish high-quality visual navigation tasks. Skip-SCAR opportunistically skips the redundant step computations during semantic segmentation and local re-planning without hurting the navigation quality. Skip-SCAR also adopts a novel hybrid sparse and dense network for object prediction, optimizing both the computation and memory footprint. Tested on the HM3D ObjectNav datasets and real-world physical hardware systems, Skip-SCAR not only minimizes hardware resources but also sets new performance benchmarks, demonstrating the benefits of optimizing both navigation quality and computational efficiency for robotics.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |

Privacy emerges as a pivotal concern within the realm of embodied AI, as the robot accesses substantial personal information. However, the issue of privacy leakage in embodied AI tasks, particularly concerning reinforcement learning algorithms, has not received adequate consideration in research. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an attack on the training process of the value-based algorithm and the gradient-based algorithm, utilizing gradient inversion to reconstruct states, actions, and supervisory signals. The choice of using gradients for the attack is motivated by the fact that commonly employed federated learning techniques solely utilize gradients computed based on private user data to optimize models, without storing or transmitting the data to public servers. Nevertheless, these gradients contain sufficient information to potentially expose private data. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on the AI2THOR simulator and evaluated our algorithm on active perception, a prevalent task in embodied AI. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in successfully reconstructing all information from the data in 120 room layouts.

In this paper, we propose TANGO, an approach that extends the program composition via LLMs already observed for images, aiming to integrate those capabilities into embodied agents capable of observing and acting in the world. Specifically, by employing a simple PointGoal Navigation model combined with a memory-based exploration policy as a foundational primitive for guiding an agent through the world, we show how a single model can address diverse tasks without additional training. We task an LLM with composing the provided primitives to solve a specific task, using only a few in-context examples in the prompt. We evaluate our approach on three key Embodied AI tasks: Open-Set ObjectGoal Navigation, Multi-Modal Lifelong Navigation, and Open Embodied Question Answering, achieving state-of-the-art results without any specific fine-tuning in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |  |

Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

Despite recent advancements in Neural Implicit Representations (NIR), existing methods often lack editability and compositional flexibility, limiting their use in scenarios requiring high interactivity and object-level manipulation. In this paper, we introduce the Gaussian Object Carver (GOC), a novel, efficient, and scalable framework for object-compositional 3D scene reconstruction. GOC leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), enriched with monocular geometry priors and multi-view geometry regularization, to achieve high-quality and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a zero-shot Object Surface Completion (OSC) model, which uses 3D priors from 3d object data to reconstruct unobserved surfaces, ensuring object completeness even in occluded areas. Experimental results demonstrate that GOC improves reconstruction efficiency and geometric fidelity. It holds promise for advancing the practical application of digital twins in embodied AI, AR/VR, and interactive simulation environments.</p></details> |  |

Many LLM-based planners are inefficient due to their large number of parameters and prone to inaccuracies because they operate in open-loop systems. We think the reason is that only applying LLMs as planners is insufficient. In this work, we propose DaDu-E, a robust closed-loop planning framework for embodied AI robots. Specifically, DaDu-E is equipped with a relatively lightweight LLM, a set of encapsulated robot skill instructions, a robust feedback system, and memory augmentation. Together, these components enable DaDu-E to (i) actively perceive and adapt to dynamic environments, (ii) optimize computational costs while maintaining high performance, and (iii) recover from execution failures using its memory and feedback mechanisms. Extensive experiments on real-world and simulated tasks show that DaDu-E achieves task success rates comparable to embodied AI robots with larger models as planners like COME-Robot, while reducing computational requirements by $6.6 \times$. Users are encouraged to explore our system at: \url{https://rlc-lab.github.io/dadu-e/}.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 figures, submitted to JFR</p></details> |
| **[Holistic Understanding of 3D Scenes as Universal Scene Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01398v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene understanding is a long-standing challenge in computer vision and a key component in enabling mixed reality, wearable computing, and embodied AI. Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered by current works. In this work, we address this shortcoming and introduce (1) an expertly curated dataset in the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, featuring high-quality manual annotations, for instance, segmentation and articulation on 280 indoor scenes; (2) a learning-based model together with a novel baseline capable of predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes, including motion type, articulated and interactable parts, and motion parameters; (3) a benchmark serving to compare upcoming methods for the task at hand. Overall, our dataset provides 8 types of annotations - object and part segmentations, motion types, movable and interactable parts, motion parameters, connectivity, and object mass annotations. With its broad and high-quality annotations, the data provides the basis for holistic 3D scene understanding models. All data is provided in the USD format, allowing interoperability and easy integration with downstream tasks. We provide open access to our dataset, benchmark, and method's source code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Right Place, Right Time! Generalizing ObjectNav to Dynamic Environments with Portable Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09905v2)** | 2024-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ObjectNav is a popular task in Embodied AI, where an agent navigates to a target object in an unseen environment. Prior literature makes the assumption of a static environment with stationary objects, which lacks realism. To address this, we present a novel formulation to generalize ObjectNav to dynamic environments with non-stationary objects, and refer to it as Portable ObjectNav or P-ObjectNav. In our formulation, we first address several challenging issues with dynamizing existing topological scene graphs by developing a novel method that introduces multiple transition behaviors to portable objects in the scene. We use this technique to dynamize Matterport3D, a popular simulator for evaluating embodied tasks. We then present a benchmark for P-ObjectNav using a combination of heuristic, reinforcement learning, and Large Language Model (LLM)-based navigation approaches on the dynamized environment, while introducing novel evaluation metrics tailored for our task. Our work fundamentally challenges the "static-environment" notion of prior ObjectNav work; the code and dataset for P-ObjectNav will be made publicly available to foster research on embodied navigation in dynamic scenes. We provide an anonymized repository for our code and dataset: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PObjectNav-1C6D.</p></details> | 19 |
| **[Learning Reward and Policy Jointly from Demonstration and Preference Improves Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06874v3)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for building contemporary foundation models and embodied AI. However, popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) break down the task into successive stages, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling (RM), and reinforcement learning (RL), each performing one specific learning task. Such a sequential approach results in serious issues such as significant under-utilization of data and distribution mismatch between the learned reward model and generated policy, which eventually lead to poor alignment performance. We develop a single stage approach named Alignment with Integrated Human Feedback (AIHF), capable of integrating both human preference and demonstration to train reward models and the policy. The proposed approach admits a suite of efficient algorithms, which can easily reduce to, and leverage, popular alignment algorithms such as RLHF and Directly Policy Optimization (DPO), and only requires minor changes to the existing alignment pipelines. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solutions with extensive experiments involving alignment problems in LLMs and robotic control problems in MuJoCo. We observe that the proposed solutions outperform the existing alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO by large margins, especially when the amount of high-quality preference data is relatively limited.</p></details> |  |
| **[EARBench: Towards Evaluating Physical Risk Awareness for Task Planning of Foundation Model-based Embodied AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04449v5)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied artificial intelligence (EAI) integrates advanced AI models into physical entities for real-world interaction. The emergence of foundation models as the "brain" of EAI agents for high-level task planning has shown promising results. However, the deployment of these agents in physical environments presents significant safety challenges. For instance, a housekeeping robot lacking sufficient risk awareness might place a metal container in a microwave, potentially causing a fire. To address these critical safety concerns, comprehensive pre-deployment risk assessments are imperative. This study introduces EARBench, a novel framework for automated physical risk assessment in EAI scenarios. EAIRiskBench employs a multi-agent cooperative system that leverages various foundation models to generate safety guidelines, create risk-prone scenarios, make task planning, and evaluate safety systematically. Utilizing this framework, we construct EARDataset, comprising diverse test cases across various domains, encompassing both textual and visual scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art foundation models reveals alarming results: all models exhibit high task risk rates (TRR), with an average of 95.75% across all evaluated models. To address these challenges, we further propose two prompting-based risk mitigation strategies. While these strategies demonstrate some efficacy in reducing TRR, the improvements are limited, still indicating substantial safety concerns. This study provides the first large-scale assessment of physical risk awareness in EAI agents. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced safety measures in EAI systems and provide valuable insights for future research directions in developing safer embodied artificial intelligence system.

Representative artificial neural networks in these fields span convolutional neural networks, Transformers, and deep Q-networks. Built upon unimodal neural networks, numerous multi-modal models have been introduced to address a range of tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, and speech recognition. The rise of instruction-following robotic policies in embodied AI has spurred the development of a novel category of multi-modal models known as vision-language-action models (VLAs). Their multi-modality capability has become a foundational element in robot learning. Various methods have been proposed to enhance traits such as versatility, dexterity, and generalizability. Some models focus on refining specific components. Others aim to develop control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. Certain VLAs serve as high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into executable subtasks. Over the past few years, a myriad of VLAs have emerged, reflecting the rapid advancement of embodied AI. Therefore, it is imperative to capture the evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, a survey of vision-language-action models</p></details> |

However, when powered with open large language models (LLMs), these agents often struggle with rudimentary tasks, even when fine-tuned on domain-specific knowledge. Inspired by human cultural learning, we present \collabvoyager, a novel framework that enhances Voyager with lifelong collaborative learning through explicit perspective-taking. \collabvoyager introduces three key innovations: (1) theory of mind representations linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural language communication between agents; and (3) semantic memory of task and environment knowledge and episodic memory of collaboration episodes. These advancements enable agents to reason about their and others' mental states, empirically addressing two prevalent failure modes: false beliefs and faulty task executions. In mixed-expertise Minecraft experiments, \collabvoyager agents outperform Voyager counterparts, significantly improving task completion rate by $66.6\% (+39.4\%)$ for collecting one block of dirt and $70.8\% (+20.8\%)$ for collecting one wood block. They exhibit emergent behaviors like knowledge transfer from expert to novice agents and collaborative code correction. \collabvoyager agents also demonstrate the ability to adapt to out-of-distribution tasks by using their previous experiences and beliefs obtained through collaboration. In this open-ended social learning paradigm, \collabvoyager paves the way for the democratic development of embodied AI, where agents learn in deployment from both peer and environmental feedback.</p></details> |  |
| **[AVID: Adapting Video Diffusion Models to World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12822v2)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale generative models have achieved remarkable success in a number of domains. However, for sequential decision-making problems, such as robotics, action-labelled data is often scarce and therefore scaling-up foundation models for decision-making remains a challenge. A potential solution lies in leveraging widely-available unlabelled videos to train world models that simulate the consequences of actions. If the world model is accurate, it can be used to optimize decision-making in downstream tasks. Image-to-video diffusion models are already capable of generating highly realistic synthetic videos. However, these models are not action-conditioned, and the most powerful models are closed-source which means they cannot be finetuned. In this work, we propose to adapt pretrained video diffusion models to action-conditioned world models, without access to the parameters of the pretrained model. Our approach, AVID, trains an adapter on a small domain-specific dataset of action-labelled videos. AVID uses a learned mask to modify the intermediate outputs of the pretrained model and generate accurate action-conditioned videos. We evaluate AVID on video game and real-world robotics data, and show that it outperforms existing baselines for diffusion model adaptation.1 Our results demonstrate that if utilized correctly, pretrained video models have the potential to be powerful tools for embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/avid-world-model-adapters/home</p></details> |

In this study, we introduce ROOT, a VLM-based system designed to enhance the analysis of indoor scenes. Specifically, we first develop an iterative object perception algorithm using GPT-4V to detect object entities within indoor scenes. This is followed by employing vision foundation models to acquire additional meta-information about the scene, such as bounding boxes. Building on this foundational data, we propose a specialized VLM, SceneVLM, which is capable of generating spatial hierarchical scene graphs and providing distance information for objects within indoor environments. This information enhances our understanding of the spatial arrangement of indoor scenes. To train our SceneVLM, we collect over 610,000 images from various public indoor datasets and implement a scene data generation pipeline with a semi-automated technique to establish relationships and estimate distances among indoor objects. By utilizing this enriched data, we conduct various training recipes and finish SceneVLM. Our experiments demonstrate that \rootname facilitates indoor scene understanding and proves effective in diverse downstream applications, such as 3D scene generation and embodied AI. The code will be released at \url{https://github.com/harrytea/ROOT}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs and 3D segmentation masks. In addition, we design MORE3D, a simple yet effective method that enables multi-object 3D reasoning segmentation with user questions and textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative World Explorer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11844v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |

However, existing datasets and benchmarks for situated understanding are limited in data modality, diversity, scale, and task scope. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-modal Situated Question Answering (MSQA), a large-scale multi-modal situated reasoning dataset, scalably collected leveraging 3D scene graphs and vision-language models (VLMs) across a diverse range of real-world 3D scenes. MSQA includes 251K situated question-answering pairs across 9 distinct question categories, covering complex scenarios within 3D scenes. We introduce a novel interleaved multi-modal input setting in our benchmark to provide text, image, and point cloud for situation and question description, resolving ambiguity in previous single-modality convention (e.g., text). Additionally, we devise the Multi-modal Situated Next-step Navigation (MSNN) benchmark to evaluate models' situated reasoning for navigation. Comprehensive evaluations on MSQA and MSNN highlight the limitations of existing vision-language models and underscore the importance of handling multi-modal interleaved inputs and situation modeling. Experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer further demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging MSQA as a pre-training dataset for developing more powerful situated reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

| **[Software-Hardware Co-Design For Embodied AI Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04292v4)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI robots have the potential to fundamentally improve the way human beings live and manufacture. Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame-basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes Corki, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI robot control. Our idea is to decouple LLM inference, robotic control and data communication in the embodied AI robots compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, Corki predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. Corki largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to 8.0x, resulting in up to 3.6x speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 17.3%. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/hyy0613/Corki</p></details> |  |

Generated models frequently fail to maintain balance when placed in physics-based simulations or 3D printed. This balance is crucial for satisfying user design intentions in interactive gaming, embodied AI, and robotics, where stable models are needed for reliable interaction. Additionally, stable models ensure that 3D-printed objects, such as figurines for home decoration, can stand on their own without requiring additional supports. To fill this gap, we introduce Atlas3D, an automatic and easy-to-implement method that enhances existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based text-to-3D tools. Atlas3D ensures the generation of self-supporting 3D models that adhere to physical laws of stability under gravity, contact, and friction. Our approach combines a novel differentiable simulation-based loss function with physically inspired regularization, serving as either a refinement or a post-processing module for existing frameworks. We verify Atlas3D's efficacy through extensive generation tasks and validate the resulting 3D models in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yunuoch.github.io/Atlas3D/</p></details> |

Current methods, including manual design, procedural generation, diffusion-based scene generation, and large language model (LLM) guided scene design, are hindered by limitations such as excessive human effort, reliance on predefined rules or training datasets, and limited 3D spatial reasoning ability. Since pre-trained 2D image generative models better capture scene and object configuration than LLMs, we address these challenges by introducing Architect, a generative framework that creates complex and realistic 3D embodied environments leveraging diffusion-based 2D image inpainting. In detail, we utilize foundation visual perception models to obtain each generated object from the image and leverage pre-trained depth estimation models to lift the generated 2D image to 3D space. Our pipeline is further extended to a hierarchical and iterative inpainting process to continuously generate placement of large furniture and small objects to enrich the scene. This iterative structure brings the flexibility for our method to generate or refine scenes from various starting points, such as text, floor plans, or pre-arranged environments.</p></details> |  |

Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, \textit{i.e.}, pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the strategy of representation. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multi-faceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multi-modal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions. We have also set up a Github repository to organize the papers included in this survey at: \url{https://github.com/ChaofanTao/Autoregressive-Models-in-Vision-Survey}.</p></details> |  |

Scene Retrieval with Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14565v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language interfaces to embodied AI are becoming more ubiquitous in our daily lives. This opens up further opportunities for language-based interaction with embodied agents, such as a user verbally instructing an agent to execute some task in a specific location. For example, "put the bowls back in the cupboard next to the fridge" or "meet me at the intersection under the red sign." As such, we need methods that interface between natural language and map representations of the environment. To this end, we explore the question of whether we can use an open-set natural language query to identify a scene represented by a 3D scene graph. We define this task as "language-based scene-retrieval" and it is closely related to "coarse-localization," but we are instead searching for a match from a collection of disjoint scenes and not necessarily a large-scale continuous map. We present Text2SceneGraphMatcher, a "scene-retrieval" pipeline that learns joint embeddings between text descriptions and scene graphs to determine if they are a match. The code, trained models, and datasets will be made public.</p></details> |  |

Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.

To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

However, current VLN frameworks often rely on static environments and optimal expert supervision, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce Human-Aware Vision-and-Language Navigation (HA-VLN), extending traditional VLN by incorporating dynamic human activities and relaxing key assumptions. We propose the Human-Aware 3D (HA3D) simulator, which combines dynamic human activities with the Matterport3D dataset, and the Human-Aware Room-to-Room (HA-R2R) dataset, extending R2R with human activity descriptions. To tackle HA-VLN challenges, we present the Expert-Supervised Cross-Modal (VLN-CM) and Non-Expert-Supervised Decision Transformer (VLN-DT) agents, utilizing cross-modal fusion and diverse training strategies for effective navigation in dynamic human environments. A comprehensive evaluation, including metrics considering human activities, and systematic analysis of HA-VLN's unique challenges, underscores the need for further research to enhance HA-VLN agents' real-world robustness and adaptability.

Our system is modular: it deploys state of the art Large Language Models for task planning,Vision-Language models for semantic perception, and Point Cloud transformers for grasping. With semantic and physical safety in mind, these modules are interfaced with a real-time trajectory optimizer and a compliant tracking controller to enable human-robot proximity. We demonstrate performance for the following tasks: bi-arm sorting, bottle opening, and trash disposal tasks. These are done zero-shot where the models used have not been trained with any real world data from this bi-arm robot, scenes or workspace. Composing both learning- and non-learning-based components in a modular fashion with interpretable inputs and outputs allows the user to easily debug points of failures and fragilities.

| **[NeuronsGym: A Hybrid Framework and Benchmark for Robot Tasks with Sim2Real Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03385v2)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of embodied AI has greatly improved the possibility of general mobile agent systems. At present, many evaluation platforms with rich scenes, high visual fidelity and various application scenarios have been developed. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework named NeuronsGym that can be used for policy learning of robot tasks, covering a simulation platform for training policy, and a physical system for studying sim2real problems. Unlike most current single-task, slow-moving robotic platforms, our framework provides agile physical robots with a wider range of speeds, and can be employed to train robotic navigation and confrontation policies. At the same time, in order to evaluate the safety of robot navigation, we propose a safety-weighted path length (SFPL) to improve the safety evaluation in the current mobile robot navigation. Based on this platform, we build a new benchmark for navigation and confrontation tasks under this platform by comparing the current mainstream sim2real methods, and hold the 2022 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG) RoboMaster sim2real challenge. We release the codes of this framework\footnote{\url{https://github.com/DRL-CASIA/NeuronsGym}} and hope that this platform can promote the development of more flexible and agile general mobile agent algorithms.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |

One notably promising application of LLM agents is robotic manipulation. Recent research has shown that LLMs can generate text planning or control code for robots, providing substantial flexibility and interaction capabilities. However, these methods still face challenges in terms of flexibility and applicability across different environments, limiting their ability to adapt autonomously. Current approaches typically fall into two categories: those relying on environment-specific policy training, which restricts their transferability, and those generating code actions based on fixed prompts, which leads to diminished performance when confronted with new environments. These limitations significantly constrain the generalizability of agents in robotic manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called EnvBridge. This approach involves the retention and transfer of successful robot control codes from source environments to target environments. EnvBridge enhances the agent's adaptability and performance across diverse settings by leveraging insights from multiple environments. Notably, our approach alleviates environmental constraints, offering a more flexible and generalizable solution for robotic manipulation tasks. We validated the effectiveness of our method using robotic manipulation benchmarks: RLBench, MetaWorld, and CALVIN. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM agents can successfully leverage diverse knowledge sources to solve complex tasks. Consequently, our approach significantly enhances the adaptability and robustness of robotic manipulation agents in planning across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

When integrated into an embodied agent, existing embodied VLM works either output detailed action sequences at the manipulation level or only provide plans at an abstract level, leaving a gap between high-level planning and real-world manipulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Octopus, an embodied vision-language programmer that uses executable code generation as a medium to connect planning and manipulation. Octopus is designed to 1) proficiently comprehend an agent's visual and textual task objectives, 2) formulate intricate action sequences, and 3) generate executable code. To facilitate Octopus model development, we introduce OctoVerse: a suite of environments tailored for benchmarking vision-based code generators on a wide spectrum of tasks, ranging from mundane daily chores in simulators to sophisticated interactions in complex video games such as Grand Theft Auto (GTA) and Minecraft. To train Octopus, we leverage GPT-4 to control an explorative agent that generates training data, i.e., action blueprints and corresponding executable code. We also collect feedback that enables an enhanced training scheme called Reinforcement Learning with Environmental Feedback (RLEF). Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate Octopus's functionality and present compelling results, showing that the proposed RLEF refines the agent's decision-making. By open-sourcing our simulation environments, dataset, and model architecture, we aspire to ignite further innovation and foster collaborative applications within the broader embodied AI community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://choiszt.github.io/Octopus/, Codebase: https://github.com/dongyh20/Octopus</p></details> |

More recently, multi-agent systems with LLM-based agents (Multi-LLM) have been utilized increasingly more for QA. In these scenarios, the models may each answer the question and reach a consensus or each model is specialized to answer different domain questions. However, most prior work dealing with Multi-LLM QA has focused on scenarios where the models are asked in a zero-shot manner or are given information sources to extract the answer. For question answering of an unknown environment, embodied exploration of the environment is first needed to answer the question. This skill is necessary for personalizing embodied AI to environments such as households. There is a lack of insight into whether a Multi-LLM system can handle question-answering based on observations from embodied exploration. In this work, we address this gap by investigating the use of Multi-Embodied LLM Explorers (MELE) for QA in an unknown environment. Multiple LLM-based agents independently explore and then answer queries about a household environment. We analyze different aggregation methods to generate a single, final answer for each query: debating, majority voting, and training a central answer module (CAM). Using CAM, we observe a $46\%$ higher accuracy compared against the other non-learning-based aggregation methods. We provide code and the query dataset for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

Through this unified latent action space, IGOR enables knowledge transfer among large-scale robot and human activity data. We achieve this by compressing visual changes between an initial image and its goal state into latent actions. IGOR allows us to generate latent action labels for internet-scale video data. This unified latent action space enables the training of foundation policy and world models across a wide variety of tasks performed by both robots and humans. We demonstrate that: (1) IGOR learns a semantically consistent action space for both human and robots, characterizing various possible motions of objects representing the physical interaction knowledge; (2) IGOR can "migrate" the movements of the object in the one video to other videos, even across human and robots, by jointly using the latent action model and world model; (3) IGOR can learn to align latent actions with natural language through the foundation policy model, and integrate latent actions with a low-level policy model to achieve effective robot control. We believe IGOR opens new possibilities for human-to-robot knowledge transfer and control.</p></details> |  |

Simulation platforms play a crucial role in advancing this field by enabling the validation and optimization of algorithms. However, existing platforms face challenges such as multilevel technical integration complexity, insufficient modularity, interface heterogeneity, and adaptation to diverse hardware. We present BestMan, a simulation platform based on PyBullet, designed to address these issues. BestMan introduces an integrated multilevel skill chain for seamless coordination across perception, planning, and control; a highly modular architecture for flexible algorithm integration; unified interfaces for smooth simulation-to-reality transfer; and a hardware-agnostic approach for adapting to various mobile manipulator configurations. These features collectively simplify development and enhance platform expandability, making BestMan a valuable tool for Embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |

Majority of prior arts adhere to an open-loop philosophy and lack real-time feedback, leading to error accumulation and undesirable robustness. A handful of approaches have endeavored to establish feedback mechanisms leveraging pixel-level differences or pre-trained visual representations, yet their efficacy and adaptability have been found to be constrained. Inspired by classic closed-loop control systems, we propose CLOVER, a closed-loop visuomotor control framework that incorporates feedback mechanisms to improve adaptive robotic control. CLOVER consists of a text-conditioned video diffusion model for generating visual plans as reference inputs, a measurable embedding space for accurate error quantification, and a feedback-driven controller that refines actions from feedback and initiates replans as needed. Our framework exhibits notable advancement in real-world robotic tasks and achieves state-of-the-art on CALVIN benchmark, improving by 8% over previous open-loop counterparts.

Building on previous work, EgoThink, we introduce VidEgoThink, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating egocentric video understanding capabilities. To bridge the gap between MLLMs and low-level control in Embodied AI, we design four key interrelated tasks: video question-answering, hierarchy planning, visual grounding and reward modeling. To minimize manual annotation costs, we develop an automatic data generation pipeline based on the Ego4D dataset, leveraging the prior knowledge and multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o. Three human annotators then filter the generated data to ensure diversity and quality, resulting in the VidEgoThink benchmark. We conduct extensive experiments with three types of models: API-based MLLMs, open-source image-based MLLMs, and open-source video-based MLLMs. Experimental results indicate that all MLLMs, including GPT-4o, perform poorly across all tasks related to egocentric video understanding. These findings suggest that foundation models still require significant advancements to be effectively applied to first-person scenarios in Embodied AI. In conclusion, VidEgoThink reflects a research trend towards employing MLLMs for egocentric vision, akin to human capabilities, enabling active observation and interaction in the complex real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[M2Diffuser: Diffusion-based Trajectory Optimization for Mobile Manipulation in 3D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11402v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have opened new avenues for research into embodied AI agents and robotics. Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation-a capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulation-remains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[EgoChoir: Capturing 3D Human-Object Interaction Regions from Egocentric Views](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13659v2)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding egocentric human-object interaction (HOI) is a fundamental aspect of human-centric perception, facilitating applications like AR/VR and embodied AI. For the egocentric HOI, in addition to perceiving semantics e.g., ''what'' interaction is occurring, capturing ''where'' the interaction specifically manifests in 3D space is also crucial, which links the perception and operation. Existing methods primarily leverage observations of HOI to capture interaction regions from an exocentric view. However, incomplete observations of interacting parties in the egocentric view introduce ambiguity between visual observations and interaction contents, impairing their efficacy. From the egocentric view, humans integrate the visual cortex, cerebellum, and brain to internalize their intentions and interaction concepts of objects, allowing for the pre-formulation of interactions and making behaviors even when interaction regions are out of sight. In light of this, we propose harmonizing the visual appearance, head motion, and 3D object to excavate the object interaction concept and subject intention, jointly inferring 3D human contact and object affordance from egocentric videos. To achieve this, we present EgoChoir, which links object structures with interaction contexts inherent in appearance and head motion to reveal object affordance, further utilizing it to model human contact. Additionally, a gradient modulation is employed to adopt appropriate clues for capturing interaction regions across various egocentric scenarios. Moreover, 3D contact and affordance are annotated for egocentric videos collected from Ego-Exo4D and GIMO to support the task. Extensive experiments on them demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of EgoChoir.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS2024, project: https://yyvhang.github.io/EgoChoir/</p></details> |

Accomplishing this goal requires learning to ground language in perception and embodied actions, in order to accomplish complex tasks. The Scalable, Instructable, Multiworld Agent (SIMA) project tackles this by training agents to follow free-form instructions across a diverse range of virtual 3D environments, including curated research environments as well as open-ended, commercial video games. Our goal is to develop an instructable agent that can accomplish anything a human can do in any simulated 3D environment. Our approach focuses on language-driven generality while imposing minimal assumptions. Our agents interact with environments in real-time using a generic, human-like interface: the inputs are image observations and language instructions and the outputs are keyboard-and-mouse actions. This general approach is challenging, but it allows agents to ground language across many visually complex and semantically rich environments while also allowing us to readily run agents in new environments. In this paper we describe our motivation and goal, the initial progress we have made, and promising preliminary results on several diverse research environments and a variety of commercial video games.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Robotics and Embodied AI make public urban spaces no longer exclusive to humans. Food delivery bots and electric wheelchairs have started sharing sidewalks with pedestrians, while robot dogs and humanoids have recently emerged in the street. Micromobility enabled by AI for short-distance travel in public urban spaces plays a crucial component in the future transportation system. Ensuring the generalizability and safety of AI models maneuvering mobile machines is essential. In this work, we present MetaUrban, a compositional simulation platform for the AI-driven urban micromobility research. MetaUrban can construct an infinite number of interactive urban scenes from compositional elements, covering a vast array of ground plans, object placements, pedestrians, vulnerable road users, and other mobile agents' appearances and dynamics. We design point navigation and social navigation tasks as the pilot study using MetaUrban for urban micromobility research and establish various baselines of Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning. We conduct extensive evaluation across mobile machines, demonstrating that heterogeneous mechanical structures significantly influence the learning and execution of AI policies. We perform a thorough ablation study, showing that the compositional nature of the simulated environments can substantially improve the generalizability and safety of the trained mobile agents. MetaUrban will be made publicly available to provide research opportunities and foster safe and trustworthy embodied AI and micromobility in cities.

Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios.

Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning.

Hand motion models with the sophistication to accurately recreate piano playing have a wide range of applications in character animation, embodied AI, biomechanics, and VR/AR. In this paper, we construct a first-of-its-kind large-scale dataset that contains approximately 10 hours of 3D hand motion and audio from 15 elite-level pianists playing 153 pieces of classical music. To capture natural performances, we designed a markerless setup in which motions are reconstructed from multi-view videos using state-of-the-art pose estimation models. The motion data is further refined via inverse kinematics using the high-resolution MIDI key-pressing data obtained from sensors in a specialized Yamaha Disklavier piano. Leveraging the collected dataset, we developed a pipeline that can synthesize physically-plausible hand motions for musical scores outside of the dataset. Our approach employs a combination of imitation learning and reinforcement learning to obtain policies for physics-based bimanual control involving the interaction between hands and piano keys. To solve the sampling efficiency problem with the large motion dataset, we use a diffusion model to generate natural reference motions, which provide high-level trajectory and fingering (finger order and placement) information. However, the generated reference motion alone does not provide sufficient accuracy for piano performance modeling. We then further augmented the data by using musical similarity to retrieve similar motions from the captured dataset to boost the precision of the RL policy. With the proposed method, our model generates natural, dexterous motions that generalize to music from outside the training dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH Asia 2024.

Despite the recent progress in Embodied AI, it is still very challenging to learn the generalizable manipulation skills that can handle large deformation and topological changes on soft-body objects, such as clay, water, and soil. In this work, we proposed an effective policy, namely GP2E behavior cloning policy, which can guide the agent to learn the generalizable manipulation skills from soft-body tasks, including pouring, filling, hanging, excavating, pinching, and writing. Concretely, we build our policy from three insights:(1) Extracting intricate semantic features from point cloud data and seamlessly integrating them into the robot's end-effector frame; (2) Capturing long-distance interactions in long-horizon tasks through the incorporation of our guided self-attention module; (3) Mitigating overfitting concerns and facilitating model convergence to higher accuracy levels via the introduction of our two-stage fine-tuning strategy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by achieving the 1st prize in the soft-body track of the ManiSkill2 Challenge at the CVPR 2023 4th Embodied AI workshop. Our findings highlight the potential of our method to improve the generalization abilities of Embodied AI models and pave the way for their practical applications in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality-Aware Transformer Networks for Robotic Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02669v2)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research in Visual Navigation reveals opportunities for improvement. First, the direct adoption of RNNs and Transformers often overlooks the specific differences between Embodied AI and traditional sequential data modelling, potentially limiting its performance in Embodied AI tasks. Second, the reliance on task-specific configurations, such as pre-trained modules and dataset-specific logic, compromises the generalizability of these methods. We address these constraints by initially exploring the unique differences between Navigation tasks and other sequential data tasks through the lens of Causality, presenting a causal framework to elucidate the inadequacies of conventional sequential methods for Navigation. By leveraging this causal perspective, we propose Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) Networks for Navigation, featuring a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the models's Environmental Understanding capability. Meanwhile, our method is devoid of task-specific inductive biases and can be trained in an End-to-End manner, which enhances the method's generalizability across various contexts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our methodology consistently surpasses benchmark performances across a spectrum of settings, tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablation studies reveal that the performance gains can be attributed to the Causal Understanding Module, which demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency in both Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Learning settings.</p></details> |  |

Exploring Backdoor Attacks against Embodied LLM-based Decision-Making Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20774v2)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in real-world decision-making tasks for embodied artificial intelligence, especially when fine-tuned to leverage their inherent common sense and reasoning abilities while being tailored to specific applications. However, this fine-tuning process introduces considerable safety and security vulnerabilities, especially in safety-critical cyber-physical systems. In this work, we propose the first comprehensive framework for Backdoor Attacks against LLM-based Decision-making systems (BALD) in embodied AI, systematically exploring the attack surfaces and trigger mechanisms. Specifically, we propose three distinct attack mechanisms: word injection, scenario manipulation, and knowledge injection, targeting various components in the LLM-based decision-making pipeline. We perform extensive experiments on representative LLMs (GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, PaLM2) in autonomous driving and home robot tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and stealthiness of our backdoor triggers across various attack channels, with cases like vehicles accelerating toward obstacles and robots placing knives on beds. Our word and knowledge injection attacks achieve nearly 100% success rate across multiple models and datasets while requiring only limited access to the system. Our scenario manipulation attack yields success rates exceeding 65%, reaching up to 90%, and does not require any runtime system intrusion. We also assess the robustness of these attacks against defenses, revealing their resilience. Our findings highlight critical security vulnerabilities in embodied LLM systems and emphasize the urgent need for safeguarding these systems to mitigate potential risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, including main paper, references, and appendix</p></details> |

However, there is still lack of study on how vision language models~(VLMs) behave when multi-modal task inputs are considered. Counterfactual planning that evaluates the model's reasoning ability over alternative task situations are also under exploited. In order to evaluate the planning ability of both multi-modal and counterfactual aspects, we propose ActPlan-1K. ActPlan-1K is a multi-modal planning benchmark constructed based on ChatGPT and household activity simulator iGibson2. The benchmark consists of 153 activities and 1,187 instances. Each instance describing one activity has a natural language task description and multiple environment images from the simulator. The gold plan of each instance is action sequences over the objects in provided scenes. Both the correctness and commonsense satisfaction are evaluated on typical VLMs. It turns out that current VLMs are still struggling at generating human-level procedural plans for both normal activities and counterfactual activities. We further provide automatic evaluation metrics by finetuning over BLEURT model to facilitate future research on our benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables, accepted to EMNLP 2024 main conference</p></details> |

With the advancement of embodied AI, robots are increasingly capable of satisfying human demands. Demand-driven navigation (DDN) is a task in which an agent must locate an object to satisfy a specified demand instruction, such as ``I am thirsty.'' The previous study typically assumes that each demand instruction requires only one object to be fulfilled and does not consider individual preferences. However, the realistic human demand may involve multiple objects. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-object Demand-driven Navigation (MO-DDN) benchmark, which addresses these nuanced aspects, including multi-object search and personal preferences, thus making the MO-DDN task more reflective of real-life scenarios compared to DDN. Building upon previous work, we employ the concept of ``attribute'' to tackle this new task. However, instead of solely relying on attribute features in an end-to-end manner like DDN, we propose a modular method that involves constructing a coarse-to-fine attribute-based exploration agent (C2FAgent). Our experimental results illustrate that this coarse-to-fine exploration strategy capitalizes on the advantages of attributes at various decision-making levels, resulting in superior performance compared to baseline methods.

For instance, a robot in an unfamiliar house initially wouldn't know the locations of objects needed for tasks and might perform inefficiently. However, as it gathers more experience, it should learn the layout of its environment and remember where objects are, allowing it to complete new tasks more efficiently. To enable such rapid adaptation to new tasks, we present ReLIC, a new approach for in-context reinforcement learning (RL) for embodied agents. With ReLIC, agents are capable of adapting to new environments using 64,000 steps of in-context experience with full attention while being trained through self-generated experience via RL. We achieve this by proposing a novel policy update scheme for on-policy RL called "partial updates'' as well as a Sink-KV mechanism that enables effective utilization of a long observation history for embodied agents. Our method outperforms a variety of meta-RL baselines in adapting to unseen houses in an embodied multi-object navigation task. In addition, we find that ReLIC is capable of few-shot imitation learning despite never being trained with expert demonstrations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of ReLIC, highlighting that the combination of large-scale RL training, the proposed partial updates scheme, and the Sink-KV are essential for effective in-context learning.

However, real-world datasets often contain insufficient data to meet the training and evaluation requirements of models. Although synthetic datasets offer a larger volume of data, their acoustic simulations lack realism. Consequently, neither real-world nor synthetic datasets effectively fulfill practical needs. To address these issues, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit de-designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim is developed based on the embodied AI simulation platform, Habitat-sim, supporting multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level, thereby generating more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a moving sound source benchmark dataset, SonicSet, using the Librispeech, the Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K) and Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from the Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to validate the differences between synthetic data and real-world data, we randomly selected 5 hours of raw data without reverberation from the SonicSet validation set to record a real-world speech separation dataset, which was then compared with the corresponding synthetic datasets. Similarly, we utilized the real-world speech enhancement dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between other synthetic datasets and the SonicSet dataset for speech enhancement. The results indicate that the synthetic data generated by SonicSim can effectively generalize to real-world scenarios.

| **[Generative Diffusion-based Contract Design for Efficient AI Twins Migration in Vehicular Embodied AI Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01176v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI is a rapidly advancing field that bridges the gap between cyberspace and physical space, enabling a wide range of applications. This evolution has led to the development of the Vehicular Embodied AI NETwork (VEANET), where advanced AI capabilities are integrated into vehicular systems to enhance autonomous operations and decision-making. Embodied agents, such as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are autonomous entities that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve specific goals, actively interacting with the physical world. Embodied twins are digital models of these embodied agents, with various embodied AI twins for intelligent applications in cyberspace. In VEANET, embodied AI twins act as in-vehicle AI assistants to perform diverse tasks supporting autonomous driving using generative AI models. Due to limited computational resources of AVs, these AVs often offload computationally intensive tasks, such as constructing and updating embodied AI twins, to nearby RSUs. However, since the rapid mobility of AVs and the limited provision coverage of a single RSU, embodied AI twins require dynamic migrations from current RSU to other RSUs in real-time, resulting in the challenge of selecting suitable RSUs for efficient embodied AI twins migrations. Given information asymmetry, AVs cannot know the detailed information of RSUs. To this end, in this paper, we construct a multi-dimensional contract theoretical model between AVs and alternative RSUs. Considering that AVs may exhibit irrational behavior, we utilize prospect theory instead of expected utility theory to model the actual utilities of AVs. Finally, we employ a generative diffusion model-based algorithm to identify the optimal contract designs. Compared with traditional deep reinforcement learning algorithms, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</p></details> |  |

However, many existing simulation frameworks typically support a narrow range of scenes/tasks and lack features critical for scaling generalizable robotics and sim2real. We introduce and open source ManiSkill3, the fastest state-visual GPU parallelized robotics simulator with contact-rich physics targeting generalizable manipulation. ManiSkill3 supports GPU parallelization of many aspects including simulation+rendering, heterogeneous simulation, pointclouds/voxels visual input, and more. Simulation with rendering on ManiSkill3 can run 10-1000x faster with 2-3x less GPU memory usage than other platforms, achieving up to 30,000+ FPS in benchmarked environments due to minimal python/pytorch overhead in the system, simulation on the GPU, and the use of the SAPIEN parallel rendering system. Tasks that used to take hours to train can now take minutes. We further provide the most comprehensive range of GPU parallelized environments/tasks spanning 12 distinct domains including but not limited to mobile manipulation for tasks such as drawing, humanoids, and dextrous manipulation in realistic scenes designed by artists or real-world digital twins. In addition, millions of demonstration frames are provided from motion planning, RL, and teleoperation. ManiSkill3 also provides a comprehensive set of baselines that span popular RL and learning-from-demonstrations algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://maniskill.ai/</p></details> |

We propose a direct yet effective method of monitoring the robot's current plan to detect changes in the environment that impact the intended trajectory of the robot significantly and then query a human for feedback. We also develop a means to parse human feedback expressed in natural language into local navigation waypoints and integrate it into a global planning system, by leveraging a map of semantic features and an aligned obstacle map. Extensive testing in simulation and physical hardware experiments with a resource-constrained wheeled robot tasked to navigate in a real-world environment validate the efficacy and robustness of our method. This work can support applications like precision agriculture and construction, where persistent monitoring of the environment provides a human with information about the environment state.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we aim to achieve both high model performance and practical deployability. Specifically, we focus on Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), a core task in Embodied AI. This paper introduces a two-stage knowledge distillation framework, producing a student model, MiniVLN, and showcasing the significant potential of distillation techniques in developing lightweight models. The proposed method aims to capture fine-grained knowledge during the pretraining phase and navigation-specific knowledge during the fine-tuning phase. Our findings indicate that the two-stage distillation approach is more effective in narrowing the performance gap between the teacher model and the student model compared to single-stage distillation. On the public R2R and REVERIE benchmarks, MiniVLN achieves performance on par with the teacher model while having only about 12% of the teacher model's parameter count.</p></details> |  |

On small form-factor devices, e.g., nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), such challenges are exacerbated by stringent constraints on energy efficiency and weight. In this paper, we explore embodied multi-modal AI-based perception for Nano-UAVs with the Kraken shield, a 7g multi-sensor (frame-based and event-based imagers) board based on Kraken, a 22 nm SoC featuring multiple acceleration engines for multi-modal event and frame-based inference based on spiking (SNN) and ternary (TNN) neural networks, respectively. Kraken can execute SNN real-time inference for depth estimation at 1.02k inf/s, 18 {\mu}J/inf, TNN real-time inference for object classification at 10k inf/s, 6 {\mu}J/inf, and real-time inference for obstacle avoidance at 221 frame/s, 750 {\mu}J/inf.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

While Next Best View (NBV) planning and Learning-based approaches offer solutions, they are often limited by predefined criteria and fail to manage occlusions with human-like common sense. To address these problems, we present AIR-Embodied, a novel framework that integrates embodied AI agents with large-scale pretrained multi-modal language models to improve active 3DGS reconstruction. AIR-Embodied utilizes a three-stage process: understanding the current reconstruction state via multi-modal prompts, planning tasks with viewpoint selection and interactive actions, and employing closed-loop reasoning to ensure accurate execution. The agent dynamically refines its actions based on discrepancies between the planned and actual outcomes. Experimental evaluations across virtual and real-world environments demonstrate that AIR-Embodied significantly enhances reconstruction efficiency and quality, providing a robust solution to challenges in active 3D reconstruction.</p></details> |  |

To accomplish long-horizon tasks, agents need to decompose abstract instructions into detailed steps. Prior works mostly rely on GPT-4V for task decomposition into predefined actions, which limits task diversity due to GPT-4V's finite understanding of larger skillsets. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a groundbreaking framework for Real world Long-horizon Embodied Planning, which can accomplish a wide range of daily tasks. At its core lies a fine-tuned large vision language model that formulates plans as sequences of skill functions according to input instruction and scene image. These functions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also equipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot Configuration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we propose a semi-automatic data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. Real-world off-line experiments across eight daily embodied tasks demonstrate that ReLEP is able to accomplish long-horizon embodied tasks and outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we introduce KARMA, an innovative memory system that integrates long-term and short-term memory modules, enhancing large language models (LLMs) for planning in embodied agents through memory-augmented prompting. KARMA distinguishes between long-term and short-term memory, with long-term memory capturing comprehensive 3D scene graphs as representations of the environment, while short-term memory dynamically records changes in objects' positions and states. This dual-memory structure allows agents to retrieve relevant past scene experiences, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of task planning. Short-term memory employs strategies for effective and adaptive memory replacement, ensuring the retention of critical information while discarding less pertinent data. Compared to state-of-the-art embodied agents enhanced with memory, our memory-augmented embodied AI agent improves success rates by 1.3x and 2.3x in Composite Tasks and Complex Tasks within the AI2-THOR simulator, respectively, and enhances task execution efficiency by 3.4x and 62.7x. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KARMA's plug-and-play capability allows for seamless deployment on real-world robotic systems, such as mobile manipulation platforms.Through this plug-and-play memory system, KARMA significantly enhances the ability of embodied agents to generate coherent and contextually appropriate plans, making the execution of complex household tasks more efficient.

However, social navigation is a safety-critical task that requires robots to avoid collisions with pedestrians, whereas existing RL-based solutions often fall short of ensuring safety in complex environments. In this paper, we propose SoNIC, which to the best of our knowledge is the first algorithm that integrates adaptive conformal inference (ACI) with constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) to enable safe policy learning for social navigation. Specifically, our method not only augments RL observations with ACI-generated nonconformity scores, which inform the agent of the quantified uncertainty but also employs these uncertainty estimates to effectively guide the behaviors of RL agents by using constrained reinforcement learning. This integration regulates the behaviors of RL agents and enables them to handle safety-critical situations. On the standard CrowdNav benchmark, our method achieves a success rate of 96.93%, which is 11.67% higher than the previous state-of-the-art RL method and results in 4.5 times fewer collisions and 2.8 times fewer intrusions to ground-truth human future trajectories as well as enhanced robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios. To further validate our approach, we deploy our algorithm on a real robot by developing a ROS2-based navigation system. Our experiments demonstrate that the system can generate robust and socially polite decision-making when interacting with both sparse and dense crowds. The video demos can be found on our project website: https://sonic-social-nav.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://sonic-social-nav.github.io/; 16 pages</p></details> |

Current approaches can be broadly categorized into two strategies: human teleoperation (for imitation learning) and sim-to-real reinforcement learning. The first approach is difficult as it is hard for humans to produce safe and dexterous motions on a different embodiment without touch feedback. The second RL-based approach struggles with the domain gap and involves highly task-specific reward engineering on complex tasks. Our key insight is that RL is effective at learning low-level motion primitives, while humans excel at providing coarse motion commands for complex, long-horizon tasks. Therefore, the optimal solution might be a combination of both approaches. In this paper, we introduce DexterityGen (DexGen), which uses RL to pretrain large-scale dexterous motion primitives, such as in-hand rotation or translation. We then leverage this learned dataset to train a dexterous foundational controller. In the real world, we use human teleoperation as a prompt to the controller to produce highly dexterous behavior. We evaluate the effectiveness of DexGen in both simulation and real world, demonstrating that it is a general-purpose controller that can realize input dexterous manipulation commands and significantly improves stability by 10-100x measured as duration of holding objects across diverse tasks. Notably, with DexGen we demonstrate unprecedented dexterous skills including diverse object reorientation and dexterous tool use such as pen, syringe, and screwdriver for the first time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://zhaohengyin.github.io/dexteritygen</p></details> |

In this paper, we address this challenge by leveraging automated large-scale test-case synthesis to enhance code model training. Specifically, we design a pipeline that generates extensive (question, test-cases) pairs from existing code data. Using these test cases, we construct preference pairs based on pass rates over sampled programs to train reward models with Bradley-Terry loss. It shows an average of 10-point improvement for Llama-3.1-8B-Ins and 5-point improvement for Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Ins through best-of-32 sampling, making the 7B model on par with 236B DeepSeek-V2.5. Furthermore, we conduct reinforcement learning with both reward models and test-case pass rewards, leading to consistent improvements across HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and LiveCodeBench (V4). Notably, we follow the R1-style training to start from Qwen2.5-Coder-base directly and show that our RL training can improve model on HumanEval-plus by over 25\% and MBPP-plus by 6\% for merely 80 optimization steps. We believe our results highlight the huge potential of reinforcement learning in coder models.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure, 8 tables</p></details> |

These systems often optimize their individual objective, leading to conflicts, particularly in general-sum games where naive reinforcement learning agents empirically converge to Pareto-suboptimal Nash equilibria. To address this issue, opponent shaping has emerged as a paradigm for finding socially beneficial equilibria in general-sum games. In this work, we introduce Advantage Alignment, a family of algorithms derived from first principles that perform opponent shaping efficiently and intuitively. We achieve this by aligning the advantages of interacting agents, increasing the probability of mutually beneficial actions when their interaction has been positive. We prove that existing opponent shaping methods implicitly perform Advantage Alignment. Compared to these methods, Advantage Alignment simplifies the mathematical formulation of opponent shaping, reduces the computational burden and extends to continuous action domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms across a range of social dilemmas, achieving state-of-the-art cooperation and robustness against exploitation.</p></details> | 25 Pages, 8 figures |
| **[PILAF: Optimal Human Preference Sampling for Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04270v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models increasingly drive real-world applications, aligning them with human values becomes paramount. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique, translating preference data into reward models when oracle human values remain inaccessible. In practice, RLHF mostly relies on approximate reward models, which may not consistently guide the policy toward maximizing the underlying human values. We propose Policy-Interpolated Learning for Aligned Feedback (PILAF), a novel response sampling strategy for preference labeling that explicitly aligns preference learning with maximizing the underlying oracle reward. PILAF is theoretically grounded, demonstrating optimality from both an optimization and a statistical perspective. The method is straightforward to implement and demonstrates strong performance in iterative and online RLHF settings where feedback curation is critical.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Reward Alignment via Hypothesis Space Batch Cutting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02921v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward design for reinforcement learning and optimal control agents is challenging. Preference-based alignment addresses this by enabling agents to learn rewards from ranked trajectory pairs provided by humans. However, existing methods often struggle from poor robustness to unknown false human preferences. In this work, we propose a robust and efficient reward alignment method based on a novel and geometrically interpretable perspective: hypothesis space batched cutting. Our method iteratively refines the reward hypothesis space through "cuts" based on batches of human preferences. Within each batch, human preferences, queried based on disagreement, are grouped using a voting function to determine the appropriate cut, ensuring a bounded human query complexity. To handle unknown erroneous preferences, we introduce a conservative cutting method within each batch, preventing erroneous human preferences from making overly aggressive cuts to the hypothesis space. This guarantees provable robustness against false preferences. We evaluate our method in a model predictive control setting across diverse tasks, including DM-Control, dexterous in-hand manipulation, and locomotion. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods in error-free settings while significantly outperforming existing method when handling high percentage of erroneous human preferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, including appendix</p></details> |

Behavioral entropy (BE), a rigorous generalization of classical entropies that incorporates cognitive and perceptual biases of agents, was recently proposed for discrete settings and shown to be a promising metric for robotic exploration problems. In this work, we propose using BE as a principled exploration objective for systematically generating datasets that provide diverse state space coverage in complex, continuous, potentially high-dimensional domains. To achieve this, we extend the notion of BE to continuous settings, derive tractable $k$-nearest neighbor estimators, provide theoretical guarantees for these estimators, and develop practical reward functions that can be used with standard RL methods to learn BE-maximizing policies. Using standard MuJoCo environments, we experimentally compare the performance of offline RL algorithms for a variety of downstream tasks on datasets generated using BE, R\'{e}nyi, and Shannon entropy-maximizing policies, as well as the SMM and RND algorithms. We find that offline RL algorithms trained on datasets collected using BE outperform those trained on datasets collected using Shannon entropy, SMM, and RND on all tasks considered, and on 80% of the tasks compared to datasets collected using R\'{e}nyi entropy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[PACE: Abstractions for Communicating Efficiently](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20120v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central but unresolved aspect of problem-solving in AI is the capability to introduce and use abstractions, something humans excel at. Work in cognitive science has demonstrated that humans tend towards higher levels of abstraction when engaged in collaborative task-oriented communication, enabling gradually shorter and more information-efficient utterances. Several computational methods have attempted to replicate this phenomenon, but all make unrealistic simplifying assumptions about how abstractions are introduced and learned. Our method, Procedural Abstractions for Communicating Efficiently (PACE), overcomes these limitations through a neuro-symbolic approach. On the symbolic side, we draw on work from library learning for proposing abstractions. We combine this with neural methods for communication and reinforcement learning, via a novel use of bandit algorithms for controlling the exploration and exploitation trade-off in introducing new abstractions. PACE exhibits similar tendencies to humans on a collaborative construction task from the cognitive science literature, where one agent (the architect) instructs the other (the builder) to reconstruct a scene of block-buildings. PACE results in the emergence of an efficient language as a by-product of collaborative communication. Beyond providing mechanistic insights into human communication, our work serves as a first step to providing conversational agents with the ability for human-like communicative abstractions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 12 figures |
| **[MA4DIV: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Search Result Diversification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17421v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Search result diversification (SRD), which aims to ensure that documents in a ranking list cover a broad range of subtopics, is a significant and widely studied problem in Information Retrieval and Web Search. Existing methods primarily utilize a paradigm of "greedy selection", i.e., selecting one document with the highest diversity score at a time or optimize an approximation of the objective function. These approaches tend to be inefficient and are easily trapped in a suboptimal state. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for search result DIVersity, which called MA4DIV. In this approach, each document is an agent and the search result diversification is modeled as a cooperative task among multiple agents. By modeling the SRD ranking problem as a cooperative MARL problem, this approach allows for directly optimizing the diversity metrics, such as $\alpha$-NDCG, while achieving high training efficiency. We conducted experiments on public TREC datasets and a larger scale dataset in the industrial setting. The experiemnts show that MA4DIV achieves substantial improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency than existing baselines, especially on the industrial dataset. The code of MA4DIV can be seen on https://github.com/chenyiqun/MA4DIV.</p></details> |  |
| **[Logic-Q: Improving Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Quantitative Trading via Program Sketch-based Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05551v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has revolutionized quantitative trading (Q-trading) by achieving decent performance without significant human expert knowledge. Despite its achievements, we observe that the current state-of-the-art DRL models are still ineffective in identifying the market trends, causing them to miss good trading opportunities or suffer from large drawdowns when encountering market crashes. To address this limitation, a natural approach is to incorporate human expert knowledge in identifying market trends. Whereas, such knowledge is abstract and hard to be quantified. In order to effectively leverage abstract human expert knowledge, in this paper, we propose a universal logic-guided deep reinforcement learning framework for Q-trading, called Logic-Q. In particular, Logic-Q adopts the program synthesis by sketching paradigm and introduces a logic-guided model design that leverages a lightweight, plug-and-play market trend-aware program sketch to determine the market trend and correspondingly adjusts the DRL policy in a post-hoc manner. Extensive evaluations of two popular quantitative trading tasks demonstrate that Logic-Q can significantly improve the performance of previous state-of-the-art DRL trading strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, this information has not been fully exploited during the inference phase, where the agent needs to generate an optimal policy instead of just reconstructing masked components from unmasked ones. Given that a pretrained trajectory model can act as both a Policy Model and a World Model with appropriate mask patterns, we propose using Model Predictive Control (MPC) at test time to leverage the model's own predictive capability to guide its action selection. Empirical results on D4RL and RoboMimic show that our inference-phase MPC significantly improves the decision-making performance of a pretrained trajectory model without any additional parameter training. Furthermore, our framework can be adapted to Offline to Online (O2O) RL and Goal Reaching RL, resulting in more substantial performance gains when an additional online interaction budget is provided, and better generalization capabilities when different task targets are specified.

| **[Simulating the Emergence of Differential Case Marking with Communicating Neural-Network Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04038v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential Case Marking (DCM) refers to the phenomenon where grammatical case marking is applied selectively based on semantic, pragmatic, or other factors. The emergence of DCM has been studied in artificial language learning experiments with human participants, which were specifically aimed at disentangling the effects of learning from those of communication (Smith & Culbertson, 2020). Multi-agent reinforcement learning frameworks based on neural networks have gained significant interest to simulate the emergence of human-like linguistic phenomena. In this study, we employ such a framework in which agents first acquire an artificial language before engaging in communicative interactions, enabling direct comparisons to human result. Using a very generic communication optimization algorithm and neural-network learners that have no prior experience with language or semantic preferences, our results demonstrate that learning alone does not lead to DCM, but when agents communicate, differential use of markers arises. This supports Smith and Culbertson (2020)'s findings that highlight the critical role of communication in shaping DCM and showcases the potential of neural-agent models to complement experimental research on language evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Tractable Inference Perspective of Offline RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00094v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A popular paradigm for offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks is to first fit the offline trajectories to a sequence model, and then prompt the model for actions that lead to high expected return. In addition to obtaining accurate sequence models, this paper highlights that tractability, the ability to exactly and efficiently answer various probabilistic queries, plays an important role in offline RL. Specifically, due to the fundamental stochasticity from the offline data-collection policies and the environment dynamics, highly non-trivial conditional/constrained generation is required to elicit rewarding actions. it is still possible to approximate such queries, we observe that such crude estimates significantly undermine the benefits brought by expressive sequence models. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes Trifle (Tractable Inference for Offline RL), which leverages modern Tractable Probabilistic Models (TPMs) to bridge the gap between good sequence models and high expected returns at evaluation time. Empirically, Trifle achieves the most state-of-the-art scores in 9 Gym-MuJoCo benchmarks against strong baselines. Further, owing to its tractability, Trifle significantly outperforms prior approaches in stochastic environments and safe RL tasks (e.g. with action constraints) with minimum algorithmic modifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Meta Coordination Graphs for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04028v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents deep meta coordination graphs (DMCG) for learning cooperative policies in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Coordination graph formulations encode local interactions and accordingly factorize the joint value function of all agents to improve efficiency in MARL. However, existing approaches rely solely on pairwise relations between agents, which potentially oversimplifies complex multi-agent interactions. DMCG goes beyond these simple direct interactions by also capturing useful higher-order and indirect relationships among agents. It generates novel graph structures accommodating multiple types of interactions and arbitrary lengths of multi-hop connections in coordination graphs to model such interactions. It then employs a graph convolutional network module to learn powerful representations in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate its effectiveness in multiple coordination problems in MARL where other state-of-the-art methods can suffer from sample inefficiency or fail entirely.

We expand this 'cake that is intelligence' analogy from a simple structural metaphor to the full life-cycle of AI systems, extending it to sourcing of ingredients (data), conception of recipes (instructions), the baking process (training), and the tasting and selling of the cake (evaluation and distribution). Leveraging our re-conceptualization, we describe each step's entailed social ramifications and how they are bounded by statistical assumptions within machine learning. Whereas these technical foundations and social impacts are deeply intertwined, they are often studied in isolation, creating barriers that restrict meaningful participation. Our re-conceptualization paves the way to bridge this gap by mapping where technical foundations interact with social outcomes, highlighting opportunities for cross-disciplinary dialogue. Finally, we conclude with actionable recommendations at each stage of the metaphorical AI cake's life-cycle, empowering prospective AI practitioners, users, and researchers, with increased awareness and ability to engage in broader AI discourse.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLPP: A Residual Method for Zero-Shot Real-World Autonomous Racing on Scaled Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17311v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous racing presents a complex environment requiring robust controllers capable of making rapid decisions under dynamic conditions. While traditional controllers based on tire models are reliable, they often demand extensive tuning or system identification. Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods offer significant potential due to their ability to learn directly from interaction, yet they typically suffer from the sim-to-real gap, where policies trained in simulation fail to perform effectively in the real world. In this paper, we propose RLPP, a residual RL framework that enhances a Pure Pursuit (PP) controller with an RL-based residual. This hybrid approach leverages the reliability and interpretability of PP while using RL to fine-tune the controller's performance in real-world scenarios. Extensive testing on the F1TENTH platform demonstrates that RLPP improves lap times of the baseline controllers by up to 6.37 %, closing the gap to the State-of-the-Art methods by more than 52 % and providing reliable performance in zero-shot real-world deployment, overcoming key challenges associated with the sim-to-real transfer and reducing the performance gap from simulation to reality by more than 8-fold when compared to the baseline RL controller. The RLPP framework is made available as an open-source tool, encouraging further exploration and advancement in autonomous racing research.

Essentially, it proactively takes the uncertainties associated with surrounding vehicles (SVs) into consideration, which encompass those stemming from the driver's intention, interactive behaviors, and the varying number of SVs. Intermediate decision variables are introduced to enable the high-level RL policy to provide an interaction-aware reference, for guiding low-level model predictive control (MPC) and further enhancing the generalization ability of the proposed framework. By leveraging the structured nature of self-driving at unsignalized intersections, the training problem of the RL policy is modeled as a bilevel curriculum learning task, which is addressed by the proposed Exp3.S-based BiMAB algorithm. It is noteworthy that the training curricula are dynamically adjusted, thereby facilitating the sample efficiency of the RL training process. Comparative experiments are conducted in the high-fidelity CARLA simulator, and the results indicate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to all baseline methods. Furthermore, experimental results in two new urban driving scenarios clearly demonstrate the commendable generalization performance of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology</p></details> |
| **[Fairness Aware Reinforcement Learning via Proximal Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03953v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fairness in multi-agent systems (MAS) focuses on equitable reward distribution among agents in scenarios involving sensitive attributes such as race, gender, or socioeconomic status. This paper introduces fairness in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a penalty term derived from demographic parity, counterfactual fairness, and conditional statistical parity. The proposed method balances reward maximisation with fairness by integrating two penalty components: a retrospective component that minimises disparities in past outcomes and a prospective component that ensures fairness in future decision-making. We evaluate our approach in the Allelopathic Harvest game, a cooperative and competitive MAS focused on resource collection, where some agents possess a sensitive attribute. Experiments demonstrate that fair-PPO achieves fairer policies across all fairness metrics than classic PPO. Fairness comes at the cost of reduced rewards, namely the Price of Fairness, although agents with and without the sensitive attribute renounce comparable amounts of rewards. Additionally, the retrospective and prospective penalties effectively change the agents' behaviour and improve fairness. These findings underscore the potential of fair-PPO to address fairness challenges in MAS.</p></details> |  |
| **[CleanSurvival: Automated data preprocessing for time-to-event models using reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03946v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data preprocessing is a critical yet frequently neglected aspect of machine learning, often paid little attention despite its potentially significant impact on model performance. While automated machine learning pipelines are starting to recognize and integrate data preprocessing into their solutions for classification and regression tasks, this integration is lacking for more specialized tasks like survival or time-to-event models. As a result, survival analysis not only faces the general challenges of data preprocessing but also suffers from the lack of tailored, automated solutions in this area. To address this gap, this paper presents 'CleanSurvival', a reinforcement-learning-based solution for optimizing preprocessing pipelines, extended specifically for survival analysis. The framework can handle continuous and categorical variables, using Q-learning to select which combination of data imputation, outlier detection and feature extraction techniques achieves optimal performance for a Cox, random forest, neural network or user-supplied time-to-event model. The package is available on GitHub: https://github.com/datasciapps/CleanSurvival Experimental benchmarks on real-world datasets show that the Q-learning-based data preprocessing results in superior predictive performance to standard approaches, finding such a model up to 10 times faster than undirected random grid search. Furthermore, a simulation study demonstrates the effectiveness in different types and levels of missingness and noise in the data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mirror Descent Actor Critic via Bounded Advantage Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03854v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regularization is a core component of recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Mirror Descent Value Iteration (MDVI) uses both Kullback-Leibler divergence and entropy as regularizers in its value and policy updates. Despite its empirical success in discrete action domains and strong theoretical guarantees, the performance of a MDVI-based method does not surpass an entropy-only-regularized method in continuous action domains. In this study, we propose Mirror Descent Actor Critic (MDAC) as an actor-critic style instantiation of MDVI for continuous action domains, and show that its empirical performance is significantly boosted by bounding the actor's log-density terms in the critic's loss function, compared to a non-bounded naive instantiation. Further, we relate MDAC to Advantage Learning by recalling that the actor's log-probability is equal to the regularized advantage function in tabular cases, and theoretically discuss when and why bounding the advantage terms is validated and beneficial. We also empirically explore a good choice for the bounding function, and show that MDAC perfoms better than strong non-regularized and entropy-only-regularized methods with an appropriate choice of the bounding function.</p></details> |  |
| **[PAGNet: Pluggable Adaptive Generative Networks for Information Completion in Multi-Agent Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03845v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For partially observable cooperative tasks, multi-agent systems must develop effective communication and understand the interplay among agents in order to achieve cooperative goals. However, existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with communication methods lack evaluation metrics for information weights and information-level communication modeling. This causes agents to neglect the aggregation of multiple messages, thereby significantly reducing policy learning efficiency. In this paper, we propose pluggable adaptive generative networks (PAGNet), a novel framework that integrates generative models into MARL to enhance communication and decision-making. PAGNet enables agents to synthesize global states representations from weighted local observations and use these representations alongside learned communication weights for coordinated decision-making. This pluggable approach reduces the computational demands typically associated with the joint training of communication and policy networks. Extensive experimental evaluations across diverse benchmarks and communication scenarios demonstrate the significant performance improvements achieved by PAGNet. Furthermore, we analyze the emergent communication patterns and the quality of generated global states, providing insights into operational mechanisms.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

We introduce Iterated Pareto Referent Optimisation (IPRO), which decomposes finding the Pareto front into a sequence of constrained single-objective problems. This enables us to guarantee convergence while providing an upper bound on the distance to undiscovered Pareto optimal solutions at each step. We evaluate IPRO using utility-based metrics and its hypervolume and find that it matches or outperforms methods that require additional assumptions. By leveraging problem-specific single-objective solvers, our approach also holds promise for applications beyond multi-objective reinforcement learning, such as planning and pathfinding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAMAS 2025</p></details> |

We investigate the benefits of policy parameterizations that naturally satisfy constraints on their Lipschitz bound, analyzing their empirical performance and robustness on two representative problems: pendulum swing-up and Atari Pong. We illustrate that policy networks with smaller Lipschitz bounds are more robust to disturbances, random noise, and targeted adversarial attacks than unconstrained policies composed of vanilla multi-layer perceptrons or convolutional neural networks. However, the structure of the Lipschitz layer is important. We find that the widely-used method of spectral normalization is too conservative and severely impacts clean performance, whereas more expressive Lipschitz layers such as the recently-proposed Sandwich layer can achieve improved robustness without sacrificing clean performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Symposium on Systems Theory in Data and Optimization (SysDO 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Efficient IAM Greybox Penetration Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14540v6)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an access control service in cloud platforms. To securely manage cloud resources, customers need to configure IAM to specify the access control rules for their cloud organizations. However, misconfigured IAM can lead to privilege escalation (PE) attacks, causing significant economic loss. Third-party cloud security services detect such issues using whitebox penetration testing, which requires full access to IAM configurations. However, since these configurations often contain sensitive data, customers must manually anonymize them to protect their privacy. To address the dual challenges of anonymization and data privacy, we introduce TAC, the first greybox penetration testing approach for third-party services to efficiently detect IAM PEs. Instead of requiring customers to blindly anonymize their entire IAM configuration, TAC intelligently interacts with customers by querying only a small fraction of information in the IAM configuration that is necessary for PE detection. To achieve this, TAC integrates two key innovations: (1) a comprehensive IAM modeling approach to detect a wide range of IAM PEs using partial information collected from query responses, and (2) a query optimization mechanism leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to minimize customer inputs. Additionally, to address the scarcity of real-world IAM PE datasets, we introduce IAMVulGen, a synthesizer that generates a large number of diverse IAM PEs that mimic real-world scenarios. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that TAC, as a greybox approach, achieves competitively low and, in some cases, significantly lower false negative rates than state-ofthe-art whitebox approaches, while utilizing a limited number of queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Reward Machines from Partially Observed Optimal Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03762v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning is the problem of inferring a reward function from an optimal policy. In this work, it is assumed that the reward is expressed as a reward machine whose transitions depend on atomic propositions associated with the state of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our goal is to identify the true reward machine using finite information. To this end, we first introduce the notion of a prefix tree policy which associates a distribution of actions to each state of the MDP and each attainable finite sequence of atomic propositions. Then, we characterize an equivalence class of reward machines that can be identified given the prefix tree policy. Finally, we propose a SAT-based algorithm that uses information extracted from the prefix tree policy to solve for a reward machine. It is proved that if the prefix tree policy is known up to a sufficient (but finite) depth, our algorithm recovers the exact reward machine up to the equivalence class. This sufficient depth is derived as a function of the number of MDP states and (an upper bound on) the number of states of the reward machine. Several examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[PRISM: A Robust Framework for Skill-based Meta-Reinforcement Learning with Noisy Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03752v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) facilitates rapid adaptation to unseen tasks but faces challenges in long-horizon environments. Skill-based approaches tackle this by decomposing state-action sequences into reusable skills and employing hierarchical decision-making. However, these methods are highly susceptible to noisy offline demonstrations, resulting in unstable skill learning and degraded performance. To overcome this, we propose Prioritized Refinement for Skill-Based Meta-RL (PRISM), a robust framework that integrates exploration near noisy data to generate online trajectories and combines them with offline data. Through prioritization, PRISM extracts high-quality data to learn task-relevant skills effectively. By addressing the impact of noise, our method ensures stable skill learning and achieves superior performance in long-horizon tasks, even with noisy and sub-optimal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages main, 19 pages appendix with reference.

However, the practical application of CDRL is encumbered by challenging projection steps, detailed parameter tuning, and domain knowledge. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a pioneering Continuous Distributional Model-Free RL algorithm tailored for continuous action spaces. The proposed algorithm simplifies the implementation of distributional RL, adopting an actor-critic architecture wherein the critic outputs a continuous probability distribution. Additionally, we propose an ensemble of multiple critics fused through a Kalman fusion mechanism to mitigate overestimation bias. Through a series of experiments, we validate that our proposed method provides a sample-efficient solution for executing complex continuous-control tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenSTARLab: Open Approach for Spatio-Temporal Agent Data Analysis in Soccer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02785v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sports analytics has become both more professional and sophisticated, driven by the growing availability of detailed performance data. This progress enables applications such as match outcome prediction, player scouting, and tactical analysis. In soccer, the effective utilization of event and tracking data is fundamental for capturing and analyzing the dynamics of the game. However, there are two primary challenges: the limited availability of event data, primarily restricted to top-tier teams and leagues, and the scarcity and high cost of tracking data, which complicates its integration with event data for comprehensive analysis. Here we propose OpenSTARLab, an open-source framework designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis in sports by addressing these key challenges. OpenSTARLab includes the Pre-processing Package that standardizes event and tracking data through Unified and Integrated Event Data and State-Action-Reward formats, the Event Modeling Package that implements deep learning-based event prediction, alongside the RLearn Package for reinforcement learning tasks. These technical components facilitate the handling of diverse data sources and support advanced analytical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the framework. To assess OpenSTARLab's effectiveness, we conducted several experimental evaluations. These demonstrate the superior performance of the specific event prediction model in terms of action and time prediction accuracies and maintained its robust event simulation performance. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments reveal a trade-off between action accuracy and temporal difference loss and show comprehensive visualization. Overall, OpenSTARLab serves as a robust platform for researchers and practitioners, enhancing innovation and collaboration in the field of soccer data analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>OpenS...</summary><p>OpenSTARLab is available at https://github.com/open-starlab, and its documentation can be found at https://openstarlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</p></details> |

Certified robustness, which provides provable guarantees about a model's ability to withstand different adversarial perturbations, has rarely been addressed in quantization due to unacceptably high cost of certifying robustness. This paper introduces ARQ, an innovative mixed-precision quantization method that not only preserves the clean accuracy of the smoothed classifiers but also maintains their certified robustness. ARQ uses reinforcement learning to find accurate and robust DNN quantization, while efficiently leveraging randomized smoothing, a popular class of statistical DNN verification algorithms. ARQ consistently performs better than multiple state-of-the-art quantization techniques across all the benchmarks and the input perturbation levels. The performance of ARQ quantized networks reaches that of the original DNN with floating-point weights, but with only 1.5% instructions and the highest certified radius.

Commonly-used approaches such as value decomposition often lead to suboptimal policies in these settings, and designing dense reward functions that align with human intuition can be complex and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose a novel framework where a large language model (LLM) generates dense, agent-specific rewards based on a natural language description of the task and the overall team goal. By learning a potential-based reward function over multiple queries, our method reduces the impact of ranking errors while allowing the LLM to evaluate each agent's contribution to the overall task. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence and higher policy returns compared to state-of-the-art MARL baselines.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Their true potential depends on effective alignment to ensure correct, trustworthy and ethical behavior, addressing challenges like misinformation, hallucinations, bias and misuse. While existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based alignment methods are notoriously complex, direct optimization approaches offer a simpler alternative. In this work, we introduce a novel direct optimization approach for LLM alignment by drawing on established Information Retrieval (IR) principles. We present a systematic framework that bridges LLM alignment and IR methodologies, mapping LLM generation and reward models to IR's retriever-reranker paradigm. Building on this foundation, we propose LLM Alignment as Retriever Preference Optimization (LarPO), a new alignment method that enhances overall alignment quality. Extensive experiments validate LarPO's effectiveness with 38.9 % and 13.7 % averaged improvement on AlpacaEval2 and MixEval-Hard respectively. Our work opens new avenues for advancing LLM alignment by integrating IR foundations, offering a promising direction for future research.</p></details> | 26 pages |

This survey provides a comprehensive review of emerging techniques enhancing reasoning in LLMs. We categorize existing methods into key approaches, including prompting strategies (e.g., Chain-of-Thought reasoning, Self-Consistency, and Tree-of-Thought reasoning), architectural innovations (e.g., retrieval-augmented models, modular reasoning networks, and neuro-symbolic integration), and learning paradigms (e.g., fine-tuning with reasoning-specific datasets, reinforcement learning, and self-supervised reasoning objectives). Additionally, we explore evaluation frameworks used to assess reasoning in LLMs and highlight open challenges, such as hallucinations, robustness, and reasoning generalization across diverse tasks. By synthesizing recent advancements, this survey aims to provide insights into promising directions for future research and practical applications of reasoning-augmented LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages, 1 Figure, IEEE Format</p></details> |

This paper compares such GPU-based methods with classical CPU-based methods on Maximum Independent Set (MIS). Experiments on standard graph families show that AI-based algorithms fail to outperform and, in many cases, to match the solution quality of the state-of-art classical solver KaMIS running on a single CPU. Some GPU-based methods even perform similarly to the simplest heuristic, degree-based greedy. Even with post-processing techniques like local search, AI-based methods still perform worse than CPU-based solvers. We develop a new mode of analysis to reveal that non-backtracking AI methods, e.g. LTFT (which is based on GFlowNets), end up reasoning similarly to the simplest degree-based greedy approach, and thus worse than KaMIS. We also find that CPU-based algorithms, notably KaMIS, have strong performance on sparse random graphs, which appears to refute a well-known conjectured upper bound for efficient algorithms from Coja-Oghlan & Efthymiou (2015).</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Computational models of predicting scanpaths on charts could complement empirical studies by offering estimates of user performance inexpensively; however, previous models have been limited to gaze patterns and overlooked the effects of tasks. Here, we contribute Chartist, a computational model that simulates how users move their eyes to extract information from the chart in order to perform analysis tasks, including value retrieval, filtering, and finding extremes. The novel contribution lies in a two-level hierarchical control architecture. At the high level, the model uses LLMs to comprehend the information gained so far and applies this representation to select a goal for the lower-level controllers, which, in turn, move the eyes in accordance with a sampling policy learned via reinforcement learning. The model is capable of predicting human-like task-driven scanpaths across various tasks. It can be applied in fields such as explainable AI, visualization design evaluation, and optimization. While it displays limitations in terms of generalizability and accuracy, it takes modeling in a promising direction, toward understanding human behaviors in interacting with charts.</p></details> |  |

One fundamental challenge in analyzing a stochastic approximation algorithm is to establish its stability, i.e., to show that the stochastic vector iterates are bounded almost surely. In this paper, we extend the celebrated Borkar-Meyn theorem for stability from the Martingale difference noise setting to the Markovian noise setting, which greatly improves its applicability in reinforcement learning, especially in those off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms with linear function approximation and eligibility traces. Central to our analysis is the diminishing asymptotic rate of change of a few functions, which is implied by both a form of the strong law of large numbers and a form of the law of the iterated logarithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR), 2025</p></details> |

However, we discover that existing methods that rely on standard SAC-style policy iteration for value learning, directly using data generated by the planner, often result in \emph{persistent value overestimation}. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, we argue that this issue is deeply rooted in the structural policy mismatch between the data generation policy that is always bootstrapped by the planner and the learned policy prior. To mitigate such a mismatch in a minimalist way, we propose a policy regularization term reducing out-of-distribution (OOD) queries, thereby improving value learning. Our method involves minimum changes on top of existing frameworks and requires no additional computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach improves performance over baselines such as TD-MPC2 by large margins, particularly in 61-DoF humanoid tasks.

Research indicates that second-life batteries (SLBs) from EVs typically retain considerable residual capacity, offering extended utility. These batteries can be effectively repurposed for use in EV charging stations (EVCS), providing a cost-effective alternative to new batteries and reducing overall planning costs. Integrating battery energy storage systems (BESS) with SLBs into EVCS is a promising strategy to alleviate system overload. However, efficient operation of EVCS with integrated BESS is hindered by uncertainties such as fluctuating EV arrival and departure times and variable power prices from the grid. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning-based (DRL) planning framework for EV charging stations with BESS, leveraging SLBs. We employ the advanced soft actor-critic (SAC) approach, training the model on a year's worth of data to account for seasonal variations, including weekdays and holidays. A tailored reward function enables effective offline training, allowing real-time optimization of EVCS operations under uncertainty.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 6 figures, Accepted, 2025 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM 2025), Austin, TX, USA</p></details> |

Integrating secure communication through authentication introduces additional computational and communication overhead, significantly impacting offloading efficiency and latency. This paper presents a unified framework incorporating lightweight Identity-Based Cryptographic (IBC) authentication into task offloading within cloud-based 6G Vehicular Twin Networks (VTNs). Utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), our approach optimizes authenticated offloading decisions to minimize latency and enhance resource allocation. Performance evaluation under varying network sizes, task sizes, and data rates reveals that IBC authentication can reduce offloading efficiency by up to 50% due to the added overhead. Besides, increasing network size and task size can further reduce offloading efficiency by up to 91.7%. As a countermeasure, increasing the transmission data rate can improve the offloading performance by as much as 63%, even in the presence of authentication overhead.

This rise in energy demand poses significant challenges to resource availability and raises sustainability concerns for large-scale IoT deployments. Efficient energy utilization in communication networks, particularly for power-constrained IoT devices, has thus become a critical area of research. In this paper, we deployed flying LoRa gateways (GWs) mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from LoRa end devices (EDs) and transmit it to a central server. Our primary objective is to maximize the global system energy efficiency (EE) of wireless LoRa networks by joint optimization of transmission power (TP), spreading factor (SF), bandwidth (W), and ED association. To solve this challenging problem, we model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where each flying LoRa GW acts as a learning agent using a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach under centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE). Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method, based on the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm, significantly improves the global system EE and surpasses the conventional MARL schemes.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial method for developing these capabilities, yet the conditions under which long CoTs emerge remain unclear, and RL training requires careful design choices. In this study, we systematically investigate the mechanics of long CoT reasoning, identifying the key factors that enable models to generate long CoT trajectories. Through extensive supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL experiments, we present four main findings: (1) While SFT is not strictly necessary, it simplifies training and improves efficiency; (2) Reasoning capabilities tend to emerge with increased training compute, but their development is not guaranteed, making reward shaping crucial for stabilizing CoT length growth; (3) Scaling verifiable reward signals is critical for RL. We find that leveraging noisy, web-extracted solutions with filtering mechanisms shows strong potential, particularly for out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks such as STEM reasoning; and (4) Core abilities like error correction are inherently present in base models, but incentivizing these skills effectively for complex tasks via RL demands significant compute, and measuring their emergence requires a nuanced approach. These insights provide practical guidance for optimizing training strategies to enhance long CoT reasoning in LLMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/eddycmu/demystify-long-cot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

The interaction and corrective feedback from human brings safety and AI alignment to the learning process. In this work, we propose a new reward-free active human involvement method called Proxy Value Propagation for policy optimization. Our key insight is that a proxy value function can be designed to express human intents, wherein state-action pairs in the human demonstration are labeled with high values, while those agents' actions that are intervened receive low values. Through the TD-learning framework, labeled values of demonstrated state-action pairs are further propagated to other unlabeled data generated from agents' exploration. The proxy value function thus induces a policy that faithfully emulates human behaviors. Human-in-the-loop experiments show the generality and efficiency of our method. With minimal modification to existing reinforcement learning algorithms, our method can learn to solve continuous and discrete control tasks with various human control devices, including the challenging task of driving in Grand Theft Auto V.

In this paper, we formalize the game equilibrium problem as an optimization problem that splits into two subproblems with respect to policy and value function, which are solved respectively by interior point method and dynamic programming. Combining these two parts, we obtain an FPTAS (fully PTAS) for the weak approximation (approximating to an $\epsilon$-equilibrium) of any perfect equilibrium of any dynamic game, implying PPAD=FP since the weak approximation problem is PPAD-complete. In addition, we introduce a geometric object called equilibrium bundle, regarding which, first, perfect equilibria of dynamic games are formalized as zero points of its canonical section, second, the hybrid iteration of dynamic programming and interior point method is formalized as a line search on it, third, it derives the existence and oddness theorems as an extension of those of Nash equilibria. In experiment, the line search process is animated, and the method is tested on 2000 randomly generated dynamic games where it converges to a perfect equilibrium in every single case.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 5 figures, code and animation are available at https://github.com/shb20tsinghua/PTAS_Game/tree/main</p></details> |

Exogenous states evolve stochastically, independent of the agent's actions, while endogenous states evolve deterministically based on both state components and actions. Exo-MDPs are useful for applications including inventory control, portfolio management, and ride-sharing. Our first result is structural, establishing a representational equivalence between the classes of discrete MDPs, Exo-MDPs, and discrete linear mixture MDPs. Specifically, any discrete MDP can be represented as an Exo-MDP, and the transition and reward dynamics can be written as linear functions of the exogenous state distribution, showing that Exo-MDPs are instances of linear mixture MDPs. For unobserved exogenous states, we prove a regret upper bound of $O(H^{3/2}d\sqrt{K})$ over $K$ trajectories of horizon $H$, with $d$ as the size of the exogenous state space, and establish nearly-matching lower bounds. Our findings demonstrate how Exo-MDPs decouple sample complexity from action and endogenous state sizes, and we validate our theoretical insights with experiments on inventory control.</p></details> | 43 pages |

Such resource allocation problems are often modeled as restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) with unknown underlying transition dynamics, hence requiring online reinforcement learning (RL). We present Bayesian Learning for Contextual RMABs (BCoR), an online RL approach for RMABs that novelly combines techniques in Bayesian modeling with Thompson sampling to flexibly model the complex RMAB settings present in public health program adherence problems, namely context and non-stationarity. BCoR's key strength is the ability to leverage shared information within and between arms to learn the unknown RMAB transition dynamics quickly in intervention-scarce settings with relatively short time horizons, which is common in public health applications. Empirically, BCoR achieves substantially higher finite-sample performance over a range of experimental settings, including a setting using real-world adherence data that was developed in collaboration with ARMMAN, an NGO in India which runs a large-scale maternal mHealth program, showcasing BCoR practical utility and potential for real-world deployment.</p></details> | 29 pages, 18 figures |

A significant challenge is the limited availability of anomalous data, often leading to misclassifying anomalies as normal events, thus raising false negatives. RL can help overcome this limitation by promoting exploration and balancing exploitation during training, effectively preventing overfitting. Wavelet analysis is also utilized to enhance anomaly detection, enabling time-series data decomposition into both time and frequency domains. This approach captures anomalies at multiple resolutions, with wavelet coefficients extracted to detect both sudden and subtle shifts in the data, thereby refining the anomaly detection process. We calibrate the decision boundary by generating synthetic anomalies and embedding a supervised framework within the model. This supervised element aids the unsupervised learning process by fine-tuning the decision boundary and increasing the model's capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication and presentation at the 2025 IEEE International systems Conference (SysCon)</p></details> |

Among them, RL agents are efficient for deployment but only perform very few tasks. By contrast, giant LLM agents (often more than 1000B parameters) present strong generalization while demanding enormous computing resources. In this work, we combine their advantages while avoiding the drawbacks by conducting the proposed referee RL on our developed large auto-regressive model (LARM). Specifically, LARM is built upon a lightweight LLM (fewer than 5B parameters) and directly outputs the next action to execute rather than text. We mathematically reveal that classic RL feedbacks vanish in long-horizon embodied exploration and introduce a giant LLM based referee to handle this reward vanishment during training LARM. In this way, LARM learns to complete diverse open-world tasks without human intervention. Especially, LARM successfully harvests enchanted diamond equipment in Minecraft, which demands significantly longer decision-making chains than the highest achievements of prior best methods.</p></details> |  |

To address the complex interactions with the underwater environment and the high experimental costs, a DNN surrogate model acts as a simulator for enabling efficient training for the RL agent. Additionally, grid-switching control is applied to select optimized models for specific force reference ranges, improving control accuracy and stability. Experimental results show that the RL agent, trained in the surrogate simulation, generates complex thrust motions and achieves precise control of a real soft fin actuator.

| **[Double Distillation Network for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03125v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning typically employs a centralized training-decentralized execution (CTDE) framework to alleviate the non-stationarity in environment. However, the partial observability during execution may lead to cumulative gap errors gathered by agents, impairing the training of effective collaborative policies. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Double Distillation Network (DDN), which incorporates two distillation modules aimed at enhancing robust coordination and facilitating the collaboration process under constrained information. The external distillation module uses a global guiding network and a local policy network, employing distillation to reconcile the gap between global training and local execution. In addition, the internal distillation module introduces intrinsic rewards, drawn from state information, to enhance the exploration capabilities of agents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDN significantly improves performance across multiple scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiLo: Learning Whole-Body Human-like Locomotion with Motion Tracking Controller](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03122v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising method to develop humanoid robot locomotion controllers. Despite the robust and stable locomotion demonstrated by previous RL controllers, their behavior often lacks the natural and agile motion patterns necessary for human-centric scenarios. In this work, we propose HiLo (human-like locomotion with motion tracking), an effective framework designed to learn RL policies that perform human-like locomotion. The primary challenges of human-like locomotion are complex reward engineering and domain randomization. HiLo overcomes these issues by developing an RL-based motion tracking controller and simple domain randomization through random force injection and action delay. Within the framework of HiLo, the whole-body control problem can be decomposed into two components: One part is solved using an open-loop control method, while the residual part is addressed with RL policies. A distributional value function is also implemented to stabilize the training process by improving the estimation of cumulative rewards under perturbed dynamics. Our experiments demonstrate that the motion tracking controller trained using HiLo can perform natural and agile human-like locomotion while exhibiting resilience to external disturbances in real-world systems. Furthermore, we show that the motion patterns of humanoid robots can be adapted through the residual mechanism without fine-tuning, allowing quick adjustments to task requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimistic ε-Greedy Exploration for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03506v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm is widely used in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, due to the representational limitations of traditional monotonic value decomposition methods, algorithms can underestimate optimal actions, leading policies to suboptimal solutions. To address this challenge, we propose Optimistic $\epsilon$-Greedy Exploration, focusing on enhancing exploration to correct value estimations. The underestimation arises from insufficient sampling of optimal actions during exploration, as our analysis indicated. We introduce an optimistic updating network to identify optimal actions and sample actions from its distribution with a probability of $\epsilon$ during exploration, increasing the selection frequency of optimal actions. Experimental results in various environments reveal that the Optimistic $\epsilon$-Greedy Exploration effectively prevents the algorithm from suboptimal solutions and significantly improves its performance compared to other algorithms.</p></details> |  |

We design the on-policy CTD algorithm and the off-policy CTDC algorithm, and prove the convergence of both algorithms. Finally, we experimentally validate the stability of our proposed algorithms. Bellman error centering facilitates the extension to various reinforcement learning algorithms.</p></details> |  |

These algorithms can be divided into two main frameworks based on whether they require an explicit reward (or value) function for training: actor-critic-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and alignment-based Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The mismatch between DPO and PPO, such as DPO's use of a classification loss driven by human-preferred data, has raised confusion about whether DPO should be classified as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. To address these ambiguities, we focus on three key aspects related to DPO, RL, and other RLHF algorithms: (1) the construction of the loss function; (2) the target distribution at which the algorithm converges; (3) the impact of key components within the loss function. Specifically, we first establish a unified framework named UDRRA connecting these algorithms based on the construction of their loss functions. Next, we uncover their target policy distributions within this framework. Finally, we investigate the critical components of DPO to understand their impact on the convergence rate. Our work provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between DPO, RL, and other RLHF algorithms, offering new insights for improving existing algorithms.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce attention-oriented metrics (ATOMs) to investigate the development of an RL agent's attention during training. In a controlled experiment, we tested ATOMs on three variations of a Pong game, each designed to teach the agent distinct behaviours, complemented by a behavioural assessment. ATOMs successfully delineate the attention patterns of an agent trained on each game variation, and that these differences in attention patterns translate into differences in the agent's behaviour. Through continuous monitoring of ATOMs during training, we observed that the agent's attention developed in phases, and that these phases were consistent across game variations. Overall, we believe that ATOM could help improve our understanding of the learning processes of RL agents and better understand the relationship between attention and learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on Scientific Methods for Understanding Deep Learning, NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

This paper provides an answer by introducing a new framework called Actor-Critic Model Predictive Control. The key idea is to embed a differentiable MPC within an actor-critic RL framework. This integration allows for short-term predictive optimization of control actions through MPC, while leveraging RL for end-to-end learning and exploration over longer horizons. Through various ablation studies, we expose the benefits of the proposed approach: it achieves better out-of-distribution behaviour, better robustness to changes in the dynamics and improved sample efficiency. Additionally, we conduct an empirical analysis that reveals a relationship between the critic's learned value function and the cost function of the differentiable MPC, providing a deeper understanding of the interplay between the critic's value and the MPC cost functions. Finally, we validate our method in a drone racing task on different tracks, in both simulation and the real world. Our method achieves the same superhuman performance as state-of-the-art model-free RL, showcasing speeds of up to 21 m/s. We show that the proposed architecture can achieve real-time control performance, learn complex behaviors via trial and error, and retain the predictive properties of the MPC to better handle out-of-distribution behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 figures, extension</p></details> |

Despite advancements in learning-based methods, existing approaches often face critical limitations, including suboptimal agent coordination, poor generalizability, and high computational latency. To address these issues, we propose Parallel AutoRegressive Combinatorial Optimization (PARCO), a reinforcement learning framework designed to construct high-quality solutions for multi-agent combinatorial tasks efficiently. To this end, PARCO integrates three key components: (1) transformer-based communication layers to enable effective agent collaboration during parallel solution construction, (2) a multiple pointer mechanism for low-latency, parallel agent decision-making, and (3) priority-based conflict handlers to resolve decision conflicts via learned priorities. We evaluate PARCO in multi-agent vehicle routing and scheduling problems where our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning methods and demonstrates strong generalization ability and remarkable computational efficiency.

This paper addresses these challenges through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework built on Gibbs Random Fields (GRFs). With GRFs, a multi-robot system is represented by a set of random variables conforming to a joint probability distribution, thus offering a fresh perspective on flocking reward design. A decentralized training and execution mechanism, which enhances the scalability of MARL concerning robot quantity, is realized using a GRF-based credit assignment method. An action attention module is introduced to implicitly anticipate the motion intentions of neighboring robots, consequently mitigating potential non-stationarity issues in MARL. The proposed framework enables learning an efficient distributed control policy for multi-robot systems in challenging environments with success rate around $99\%$, as demonstrated through thorough comparisons with state-of-the-art solutions in simulations and experiments. Ablation studies are also performed to validate the efficiency of different framework modules.</p></details> | 9 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Mitigating Information Loss in Tree-Based Reinforcement Learning via Direct Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08761v4)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has seen significant success across various domains, but its adoption is often limited by the black-box nature of neural network policies, making them difficult to interpret. In contrast, symbolic policies allow representing decision-making strategies in a compact and interpretable way. However, learning symbolic policies directly within on-policy methods remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce SYMPOL, a novel method for SYMbolic tree-based on-POLicy RL. SYMPOL employs a tree-based model integrated with a policy gradient method, enabling the agent to learn and adapt its actions while maintaining a high level of interpretability. We evaluate SYMPOL on a set of benchmark RL tasks, demonstrating its superiority over alternative tree-based RL approaches in terms of performance and interpretability. Unlike existing methods, it enables gradient-based, end-to-end learning of interpretable, axis-aligned decision trees within standard on-policy RL algorithms. Therefore, SYMPOL can become the foundation for a new class of interpretable RL based on decision trees. Our implementation is available under: https://github.com/s-marton/sympol</p></details> |  |

We first formulate the problem as a generic regularized loss minimization over probability distributions and directly optimize the distribution using the Dual Averaging method. Next, we enable sampling from the learned distribution by approximating its score function via Doob's $h$-transform technique. The proposed framework is supported by rigorous convergence guarantees and an end-to-end bound on the sampling error, which imply that when the original distribution's score is known accurately, the complexity of sampling from shifted distributions is independent of isoperimetric conditions. This framework is broadly applicable to general distribution optimization problems, including alignment tasks in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO). We empirically validate its performance on synthetic and image datasets using the DPO objective.</p></details> |  |

The tendency for people to connect with others who share similar characteristics and views, known as homophily, plays a key role in the formation of echo chambers which further amplify polarization and division. Existing works examining homophily in online communities traditionally infer it using content- or adjacency-based approaches, such as constructing explicit interaction networks or performing topic analysis. These methods fall short for platforms where interaction networks cannot be easily constructed and fail to capture the complex nature of user interactions across the platform. This work introduces a novel approach for quantifying user homophily. We first use an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework to infer users' policies, then use these policies as a measure of behavioral homophily. We apply our method to Reddit, conducting a case study across 5.9 million interactions over six years, demonstrating how this approach uncovers distinct behavioral patterns and user roles that vary across different communities. We further validate our behavioral homophily measure against traditional content-based homophily, offering a powerful method for analyzing social media dynamics and their broader societal implications. We find, among others, that users can behave very similarly (high behavioral homophily) when discussing entirely different topics like soccer vs e-sports (low topical homophily), and that there is an entire class of users on Reddit whose purpose seems to be to disagree with others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interactive Symbolic Regression through Offline Reinforcement Learning: A Co-Design Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02917v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic Regression (SR) holds great potential for uncovering underlying mathematical and physical relationships from observed data. However, the vast combinatorial space of possible expressions poses significant challenges for both online search methods and pre-trained transformer models. Additionally, current state-of-the-art approaches typically do not consider the integration of domain experts' prior knowledge and do not support iterative interactions with the model during the equation discovery process. To address these challenges, we propose the Symbolic Q-network (Sym-Q), an advanced interactive framework for large-scale symbolic regression. Unlike previous large-scale transformer-based SR approaches, Sym-Q leverages reinforcement learning without relying on a transformer-based decoder. This formulation allows the agent to learn through offline reinforcement learning using any type of tree encoder, enabling more efficient training and inference. Furthermore, we propose a co-design mechanism, where the reinforcement learning-based Sym-Q facilitates effective interaction with domain experts at any stage of the equation discovery process. Users can dynamically modify generated nodes of the expression, collaborating with the agent to tailor the mathematical expression to best fit the problem and align with the assumed physical laws, particularly when there is prior partial knowledge of the expected behavior. Our experiments demonstrate that the pre-trained Sym-Q surpasses existing SR algorithms on the challenging SSDNC benchmark. Moreover, we experimentally show on real-world cases that its performance can be further enhanced by the interactive co-design mechanism, with Sym-Q achieving greater performance gains than other state-of-the-art models.

| **[SAMBO-RL: Shifts-aware Model-based Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12830v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based offline reinforcement learning trains policies using pre-collected datasets and learned environment models, eliminating the need for direct real-world environment interaction. However, this paradigm is inherently challenged by distribution shift (DS). Existing methods address this issue by leveraging off-policy mechanisms and estimating model uncertainty, but they often result in inconsistent objectives and lack a unified theoretical foundation. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis that disentangles the problem into two fundamental components: model bias and policy shift. Our theoretical and empirical investigations reveal how these factors distort value estimation and restrict policy optimization. To tackle these challenges, we derive a novel Shifts-aware Reward (SAR) through a unified probabilistic inference framework, which modifies the vanilla reward to refine value learning and facilitate policy training. Building on this, we introduce Shifts-aware Model-based Offline Reinforcement Learning (SAMBO-RL), a practical framework that efficiently trains classifiers to approximate SAR for policy optimization. Empirical experiments show that SAR effectively mitigates DS, and SAMBO-RL achieves superior or comparable performance across various benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness and validating our theoretical analysis.</p></details> |  |

Tree-exploiting PSRO (TE-PSRO) is a variant of this approach that iteratively builds a coarsened empirical game model in extensive form using data obtained from querying a simulator that represents a detailed description of the game. We make two main methodological advances to TE-PSRO that enhance its applicability to complex games of imperfect information. First, we introduce a scalable representation for the empirical game tree where edges correspond to implicit policies learned through DRL. These policies cover conditions in the underlying game abstracted in the game model, supporting sustainable growth of the tree over epochs. Second, we leverage extensive form in the empirical model by employing refined Nash equilibria to direct strategy exploration. To enable this, we give a modular and scalable algorithm based on generalized backward induction for computing a subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) in an imperfect-information game. We experimentally evaluate our approach on a suite of games including an alternating-offer bargaining game with outside offers; our results demonstrate that TE-PSRO converges toward equilibrium faster when new strategies are generated based on SPE rather than Nash equilibrium, and with reasonable time/memory requirements for the growing empirical model.</p></details> |  |

| **[Heterogeneous Value Decomposition Policy Fusion for Multi-Agent Cooperation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02875v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Value decomposition (VD) has become one of the most prominent solutions in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. Most existing methods generally explore how to factorize the joint value and minimize the discrepancies between agent observations and characteristics of environmental states. However, direct decomposition may result in limited representation or difficulty in optimization. Orthogonal to designing a new factorization scheme, in this paper, we propose Heterogeneous Policy Fusion (HPF) to integrate the strengths of various VD methods. We construct a composite policy set to select policies for interaction adaptively. Specifically, this adaptive mechanism allows agents' trajectories to benefit from diverse policy transitions while incorporating the advantages of each factorization method. Additionally, HPF introduces a constraint between these heterogeneous policies to rectify the misleading update caused by the unexpected exploratory or suboptimal non-cooperation. Experimental results on cooperative tasks show HPF's superior performance over multiple baselines, proving its effectiveness and ease of implementation.</p></details> |  |

These tasks are procedurally generated by randomizing state transitions and rewards within Markov Decision Processes. To facilitate this extensive meta-training, we propose two key innovations: 1. An efficient data synthesis pipeline for ICRL, which leverages the interaction histories of diverse behavior policies; and 2. A novel modeling framework that integrates both imitation learning and reinforcement learning (RL) within the context, by incorporating prior knowledge. For the first time, we demonstrate that in-context learning (ICL) alone, without any gradient-based fine-tuning, can successfully tackle unseen Gymnasium tasks through imitation learning, online RL, or offline RL. Additionally, we show that achieving generalized ICRL capabilities-unlike task identification-oriented few-shot learning-critically depends on long trajectories generated by variant tasks and diverse behavior policies. By emphasizing the potential of ICL and departing from pre-training focused on acquiring specific skills, we further underscore the significance of meta-training aimed at cultivating the ability of ICL itself.</p></details> | Preprint |

To address this limitation, we propose the Wolfpack Adversarial Attack framework, inspired by wolf hunting strategies, which targets an initial agent and its assisting agents to disrupt cooperation. Additionally, we introduce the Wolfpack-Adversarial Learning for MARL (WALL) framework, which trains robust MARL policies to defend against the proposed Wolfpack attack by fostering system-wide collaboration. Experimental results underscore the devastating impact of the Wolfpack attack and the significant robustness improvements achieved by WALL.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages main, 21 pages appendix with reference.

While context-based meta-RL methods improve task representation using task latents, they often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. To address this, we propose Task-Aware Virtual Training (TAVT), a novel algorithm that accurately captures task characteristics for both training and OOD scenarios using metric-based representation learning. Our method successfully preserves task characteristics in virtual tasks and employs a state regularization technique to mitigate overestimation errors in state-varying environments. Numerical results demonstrate that TAVT significantly enhances generalization to OOD tasks across various MuJoCo and MetaWorld environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages main paper, 19 pages appendices with reference, Submitted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Teaching Language Models to Critique via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03492v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teaching large language models (LLMs) to critique and refine their outputs is crucial for building systems that can iteratively improve, yet it is fundamentally limited by the ability to provide accurate judgments and actionable suggestions. In this work, we study LLM critics for code generation and propose $\texttt{CTRL}$, a framework for $\texttt{C}$ritic $\texttt{T}$raining via $\texttt{R}$einforcement $\texttt{L}$earning, which trains a critic model to generate feedback that maximizes correction performance for a fixed generator model without human supervision. Our results demonstrate that critics trained with $\texttt{CTRL}$ significantly enhance pass rates and mitigate compounding errors across both base and stronger generator models. Furthermore, we show that these critic models act as accurate generative reward models and enable test-time scaling through iterative critique-revision, achieving up to 106.1% relative improvements across challenging code generation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepAveragers: Offline Reinforcement Learning by Solving Derived Non-Parametric MDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08891v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study an approach to offline reinforcement learning (RL) based on optimally solving finitely-represented MDPs derived from a static dataset of experience. This approach can be applied on top of any learned representation and has the potential to easily support multiple solution objectives as well as zero-shot adjustment to changing environments and goals. Our main contribution is to introduce the Deep Averagers with Costs MDP (DAC-MDP) and to investigate its solutions for offline RL. DAC-MDPs are a non-parametric model that can leverage deep representations and account for limited data by introducing costs for exploiting under-represented parts of the model. In theory, we show conditions that allow for lower-bounding the performance of DAC-MDP solutions. We also investigate the empirical behavior in a number of environments, including those with image-based observations. Overall, the experiments demonstrate that the framework can work in practice and scale to large complex offline RL problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera Ready ICLR 2021</p></details> |
| **[Rapidly Adapting Policies to the Real World via Simulation-Guided Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02705v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning requires a considerable amount of high-quality data to realize the promise of generalization. However, large data sets are costly to collect in the real world. Physics simulators can cheaply generate vast data sets with broad coverage over states, actions, and environments. However, physics engines are fundamentally misspecified approximations to reality. This makes direct zero-shot transfer from simulation to reality challenging, especially in tasks where precise and force-sensitive manipulation is necessary. Thus, fine-tuning these policies with small real-world data sets is an appealing pathway for scaling robot learning. However, current reinforcement learning fine-tuning frameworks leverage general, unstructured exploration strategies which are too inefficient to make real-world adaptation practical. This paper introduces the Simulation-Guided Fine-tuning (SGFT) framework, which demonstrates how to extract structural priors from physics simulators to substantially accelerate real-world adaptation. Specifically, our approach uses a value function learned in simulation to guide real-world exploration. We demonstrate this approach across five real-world dexterous manipulation tasks where zero-shot sim-to-real transfer fails. We further demonstrate our framework substantially outperforms baseline fine-tuning methods, requiring up to an order of magnitude fewer real-world samples and succeeding at difficult tasks where prior approaches fail entirely. Last but not least, we provide theoretical justification for this new paradigm which underpins how SGFT can rapidly learn high-performance policies in the face of large sim-to-real dynamics gaps.

| **[Hybrid LLM-DDQN based Joint Optimization of V2I Communication and Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08854v3)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have received considerable interest recently due to their outstanding reasoning and comprehension capabilities. This work explores applying LLMs to vehicular networks, aiming to jointly optimize vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications and autonomous driving (AD) policies. We deploy LLMs for AD decision-making to maximize traffic flow and avoid collisions for road safety, and a double deep Q-learning algorithm (DDQN) is used for V2I optimization to maximize the received data rate and reduce frequent handovers. In particular, for LLM-enabled AD, we employ the Euclidean distance to identify previously explored AD experiences, and then LLMs can learn from past good and bad decisions for further improvement. Then, LLM-based AD decisions will become part of states in V2I problems, and DDQN will optimize the V2I decisions accordingly. After that, the AD and V2I decisions are iteratively optimized until convergence. Such an iterative optimization approach can better explore the interactions between LLMs and conventional reinforcement learning techniques, revealing the potential of using LLMs for network optimization and management. Finally, the simulations demonstrate that our proposed hybrid LLM-DDQN approach outperforms the conventional DDQN algorithm, showing faster convergence and higher average rewards.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Wireless Communications Letters</p></details> |
| **[On Teacher Hacking in Language Model Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02671v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training of language models (LMs) increasingly relies on the following two stages: (i) knowledge distillation, where the LM is trained to imitate a larger teacher LM, and (ii) reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where the LM is aligned by optimizing a reward model. In the second RLHF stage, a well-known challenge is reward hacking, where the LM over-optimizes the reward model. Such phenomenon is in line with Goodhart's law and can lead to degraded performance on the true objective. In this paper, we investigate whether a similar phenomenon, that we call teacher hacking, can occur during knowledge distillation. This could arise because the teacher LM is itself an imperfect approximation of the true distribution. To study this, we propose a controlled experimental setup involving: (i) an oracle LM representing the ground-truth distribution, (ii) a teacher LM distilled from the oracle, and (iii) a student LM distilled from the teacher. Our experiments reveal the following insights. When using a fixed offline dataset for distillation, teacher hacking occurs; moreover, we can detect it by observing when the optimization process deviates from polynomial convergence laws. In contrast, employing online data generation techniques effectively mitigates teacher hacking. More precisely, we identify data diversity as the key factor in preventing hacking. Overall, our findings provide a deeper understanding of the benefits and limitations of distillation for building robust and efficient LMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning Enabled Persistent Surveillance with Energy-Aware UAV-UGV Systems for Disaster Management Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02666v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) provides an effective solution for persistent surveillance in disaster management. UAVs excel at covering large areas rapidly, but their range is limited by battery capacity. UGVs, though slower, can carry larger batteries for extended missions. By using UGVs as mobile recharging stations, UAVs can extend mission duration through periodic refueling, leveraging the complementary strengths of both systems. To optimize this energy-aware UAV-UGV cooperative routing problem, we propose a planning framework that determines optimal routes and recharging points between a UAV and a UGV. Our solution employs a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework built on an encoder-decoder transformer architecture with multi-head attention mechanisms. This architecture enables the model to sequentially select actions for visiting mission points and coordinating recharging rendezvous between the UAV and UGV. The DRL model is trained to minimize the age periods (the time gap between consecutive visits) of mission points, ensuring effective surveillance. We evaluate the framework across various problem sizes and distributions, comparing its performance against heuristic methods and an existing learning-based model. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms these baselines in both solution quality and runtime. Additionally, we demonstrate the DRL policy's applicability in a real-world disaster scenario as a case study and explore its potential for online mission planning to handle dynamic changes. Adapting the DRL policy for priority-driven surveillance highlights the model's generalizability for real-time disaster response.</p></details> | Submitted |
| **[Flow Q-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02538v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present flow Q-learning (FQL), a simple and performant offline reinforcement learning (RL) method that leverages an expressive flow-matching policy to model arbitrarily complex action distributions in data. Training a flow policy with RL is a tricky problem, due to the iterative nature of the action generation process. We address this challenge by training an expressive one-step policy with RL, rather than directly guiding an iterative flow policy to maximize values. This way, we can completely avoid unstable recursive backpropagation, eliminate costly iterative action generation at test time, yet still mostly maintain expressivity. We experimentally show that FQL leads to strong performance across 73 challenging state- and pixel-based OGBench and D4RL tasks in offline RL and offline-to-online RL.

Recent studies have shown that increasing test-time computation enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This typically involves extensive sampling at inference time guided by an external LLM verifier, resulting in a two-player system. Despite external guidance, the effectiveness of this system demonstrates the potential of a single LLM to tackle complex tasks. Thus, we pose a new research problem: Can we internalize the searching capabilities to fundamentally enhance the reasoning abilities of a single LLM? This work explores an orthogonal direction focusing on post-training LLMs for autoregressive searching (i.e., an extended reasoning process with self-reflection and self-exploration of new strategies). To achieve this, we propose the Chain-of-Action-Thought (COAT) reasoning and a two-stage training paradigm: 1) a small-scale format tuning stage to internalize the COAT reasoning format and 2) a large-scale self-improvement stage leveraging reinforcement learning. Our approach results in Satori, a 7B LLM trained on open-source models and data. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Satori achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks while exhibits strong generalization to out-of-domain tasks. Code, data, and models will be fully open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Energy Loss Phenomenon in RLHF: A New Perspective on Mitigating Reward Hacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19358v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work identifies the Energy Loss Phenomenon in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its connection to reward hacking. Specifically, energy loss in the final layer of a Large Language Model (LLM) gradually increases during the RL process, with an excessive increase in energy loss characterizing reward hacking. Beyond empirical analysis, we further provide a theoretical foundation by proving that, under mild conditions, the increased energy loss reduces the upper bound of contextual relevance in LLMs, which is a critical aspect of reward hacking as the reduced contextual relevance typically indicates overfitting to reward model-favored patterns in RL. To address this issue, we propose an Energy loss-aware PPO algorithm (EPPO) which penalizes the increase in energy loss in the LLM's final layer during reward calculation to prevent excessive energy loss, thereby mitigating reward hacking. We theoretically show that EPPO can be conceptually interpreted as an entropy-regularized RL algorithm, which provides deeper insights into its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and tasks demonstrate the commonality of the energy loss phenomenon, as well as the effectiveness of EPPO in mitigating reward hacking and improving RLHF performance.</p></details> | 28 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Is poisoning a real threat to LLM alignment? Maybe more so than you think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12091v3)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) have significantly impacted the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). The sensitivity of reinforcement learning algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has led to new line work on Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), which treats RLHF in a supervised learning framework. The increased practical use of these RLHF methods warrants an analysis of their vulnerabilities. In this work, we investigate the vulnerabilities of DPO to poisoning attacks under different scenarios and compare the effectiveness of preference poisoning, a first of its kind. We comprehensively analyze DPO's vulnerabilities under different types of attacks, i.e., backdoor and non-backdoor attacks, and different poisoning methods across a wide array of language models, i.e., LLama 7B, Mistral 7B, and Gemma 7B. We find that unlike PPO-based methods, which, when it comes to backdoor attacks, require at least 4\% of the data to be poisoned to elicit harmful behavior, we exploit the true vulnerabilities of DPO more simply so we can poison the model with only as much as 0.5\% of the data. We further investigate the potential reasons behind the vulnerability and how well this vulnerability translates into backdoor vs non-backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Fast Graph Generation via Autoregressive Noisy Filtration Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02415v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph generative models often face a critical trade-off between learning complex distributions and achieving fast generation speed. We introduce Autoregressive Noisy Filtration Modeling (ANFM), a novel approach that addresses both challenges. ANFM leverages filtration, a concept from topological data analysis, to transform graphs into short sequences of monotonically increasing subgraphs. This formulation extends the sequence families used in previous autoregressive models. To learn from these sequences, we propose a novel autoregressive graph mixer model. Our experiments suggest that exposure bias might represent a substantial hurdle in autoregressive graph generation and we introduce two mitigation strategies to address it: noise augmentation and a reinforcement learning approach. Incorporating these techniques leads to substantial performance gains, making ANFM competitive with state-of-the-art diffusion models across diverse synthetic and real-world datasets. Notably, ANFM produces remarkably short sequences, achieving a 100-fold speedup in generation time compared to diffusion models. This work marks a significant step toward high-throughput graph generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 27 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[A Provably Efficient Option-Based Algorithm for both High-Level and Low-Level Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15124v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approaches have shown successful results in solving a large variety of complex, structured, long-horizon problems. Nevertheless, a full theoretical understanding of this empirical evidence is currently missing. In the context of the \emph{option} framework, prior research has devised efficient algorithms for scenarios where options are fixed, and the high-level policy selecting among options only has to be learned. However, the fully realistic scenario in which both the high-level and the low-level policies are learned is surprisingly disregarded from a theoretical perspective. This work makes a step towards the understanding of this latter scenario. Focusing on the finite-horizon problem, we present a meta-algorithm alternating between regret minimization algorithms instanced at different (high and low) temporal abstractions. At the higher level, we treat the problem as a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP), with fixed low-level policies, while at a lower level, inner option policies are learned with a fixed high-level policy. The bounds derived are compared with the lower bound for non-hierarchical finite-horizon problems, allowing to characterize when a hierarchical approach is provably preferable, even without pre-trained options.</p></details> |  |
| **[Achieving Hiding and Smart Anti-Jamming Communication: A Parallel DRL Approach against Moving Reactive Jammer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02385v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of anti-jamming in moving reactive jamming scenarios. The moving reactive jammer initiates high-power tracking jamming upon detecting any transmission activity, and when unable to detect a signal, resorts to indiscriminate jamming. This presents dual imperatives: maintaining hiding to avoid the jammer's detection and simultaneously evading indiscriminate jamming. Spread spectrum techniques effectively reduce transmitting power to elude detection but fall short in countering indiscriminate jamming. Conversely, changing communication frequencies can help evade indiscriminate jamming but makes the transmission vulnerable to tracking jamming without spread spectrum techniques to remain hidden. Current methodologies struggle with the complexity of simultaneously optimizing these two requirements due to the expansive joint action spaces and the dynamics of moving reactive jammers. To address these challenges, we propose a parallelized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) strategy. The approach includes a parallelized network architecture designed to decompose the action space. A parallel exploration-exploitation selection mechanism replaces the $\varepsilon $-greedy mechanism, accelerating convergence. Simulations demonstrate a nearly 90\% increase in normalized throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[Circular Microalgae-Based Carbon Control for Net Zero](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02382v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The alteration of the climate in various areas of the world is of increasing concern since climate stability is a necessary condition for human survival as well as every living organism. The main reason of climate change is the greenhouse effect caused by the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In this paper, we design a networked system underpinned by compartmental dynamical thermodynamics to circulate the atmospheric carbon dioxide. Specifically, in the carbon dioxide emitter compartment, we develop an initial-condition-dependent finite-time stabilizing controller that guarantees stability within a desired time leveraging the system property of affinity in the control. Then, to compensate for carbon emissions we show that a cultivation of microalgae with a volume 625 times bigger than the one of the carbon emitter is required. To increase the carbon uptake of the microalgae, we implement the nonaffine-in-the-control microalgae dynamical equations as an environment of a state-of-the-art library for reinforcement learning (RL), namely, Stable-Baselines3, and then, through the library, we test the performance of eight RL algorithms for training a controller that maximizes the microalgae absorption of carbon through the light intensity. All the eight controllers increased the carbon absorption of the cultivation during a training of 200,000 time steps with a maximum episode length of 200 time steps and with no termination conditions. This work is a first step towards approaching net zero as a classical and learning-based network control problem. The source code is publicly available.</p></details> | To be submitted |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Long-Horizon Interactive LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01600v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive digital agents (IDAs) leverage APIs of stateful digital environments to perform tasks in response to user requests. While IDAs powered by instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) can react to feedback from interface invocations in multi-step exchanges, they have not been trained in their respective digital environments. Prior methods accomplish less than half of tasks in sophisticated benchmarks such as AppWorld. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains IDAs directly in their target environments. We formalize this training as a partially observable Markov decision process and derive LOOP, a data- and memory-efficient variant of proximal policy optimization. LOOP uses no value network and maintains exactly one copy of the underlying LLM in memory, making its implementation straightforward and as memory-efficient as fine-tuning a single LLM. A 32-billion-parameter agent trained with LOOP in the AppWorld environment outperforms the much larger OpenAI o1 agent by 9 percentage points (15% relative). To our knowledge, this is the first reported application of RL to IDAs that interact with a stateful, multi-domain, multi-app environment via direct API calls. Our analysis sheds light on the effectiveness of RL in this area, showing that the agent learns to consult the API documentation, avoid unwarranted assumptions, minimize confabulation, and recover from setbacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coreset-Based Task Selection for Sample-Efficient Meta-Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02332v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study task selection to enhance sample efficiency in model-agnostic meta-reinforcement learning (MAML-RL). Traditional meta-RL typically assumes that all available tasks are equally important, which can lead to task redundancy when they share significant similarities. To address this, we propose a coreset-based task selection approach that selects a weighted subset of tasks based on how diverse they are in gradient space, prioritizing the most informative and diverse tasks. Such task selection reduces the number of samples needed to find an $\epsilon$-close stationary solution by a factor of O(1/$\epsilon$). Consequently, it guarantees a faster adaptation to unseen tasks while focusing training on the most relevant tasks. As a case study, we incorporate task selection to MAML-LQR (Toso et al., 2024b), and prove a sample complexity reduction proportional to O(log(1/$\epsilon$)) when the task specific cost also satisfy gradient dominance. Our theoretical guarantees underscore task selection as a key component for scalable and sample-efficient meta-RL. We numerically validate this trend across multiple RL benchmark problems, illustrating the benefits of task selection beyond the LQR baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinfier and Reintrainer: Verification and Interpretation-Driven Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15127v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring verifiable and interpretable safety of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is crucial for its deployment in real-world applications. Existing approaches like verification-in-the-loop training, however, face challenges such as difficulty in deployment, inefficient training, lack of interpretability, and suboptimal performance in property satisfaction and reward performance. In this work, we propose a novel verification-driven interpretation-in-the-loop framework Reintrainer to develop trustworthy DRL models, which are guaranteed to meet the expected constraint properties. Specifically, in each iteration, this framework measures the gap between the on-training model and predefined properties using formal verification, interprets the contribution of each input feature to the model's output, and then generates the training strategy derived from the on-the-fly measure results, until all predefined properties are proven. Additionally, the low reusability of existing verifiers and interpreters motivates us to develop Reinfier, a general and fundamental tool within Reintrainer for DRL verification and interpretation. Reinfier features breakpoints searching and verification-driven interpretation, associated with a concise constraint-encoding language DRLP. Evaluations demonstrate that Reintrainer outperforms the state-of-the-art on six public benchmarks in both performance and property guarantees. Our framework can be accessed at https://github.com/Kurayuri/Reinfier.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy-Guided Causal State Representation for Offline Reinforcement Learning Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02327v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In offline reinforcement learning-based recommender systems (RLRS), learning effective state representations is crucial for capturing user preferences that directly impact long-term rewards. However, raw state representations often contain high-dimensional, noisy information and components that are not causally relevant to the reward. Additionally, missing transitions in offline data make it challenging to accurately identify features that are most relevant to user satisfaction. To address these challenges, we propose Policy-Guided Causal Representation (PGCR), a novel two-stage framework for causal feature selection and state representation learning in offline RLRS. In the first stage, we learn a causal feature selection policy that generates modified states by isolating and retaining only the causally relevant components (CRCs) while altering irrelevant components. This policy is guided by a reward function based on the Wasserstein distance, which measures the causal effect of state components on the reward and encourages the preservation of CRCs that directly influence user interests. In the second stage, we train an encoder to learn compact state representations by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) loss between the latent representations of the original and modified states, ensuring that the representations focus on CRCs. We provide a theoretical analysis proving the identifiability of causal effects from interventions, validating the ability of PGCR to isolate critical state components for decision-making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PGCR significantly improves recommendation performance, confirming its effectiveness for offline RL-based recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DIME:Diffusion-Based Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02316v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt-RL) has become the standard approach to RL due to its beneficial exploration properties. Traditionally, policies are parameterized using Gaussian distributions, which significantly limits their representational capacity. Diffusion-based policies offer a more expressive alternative, yet integrating them into MaxEnt-RL poses challenges--primarily due to the intractability of computing their marginal entropy. To overcome this, we propose Diffusion-Based Maximum Entropy RL (DIME). DIME leverages recent advances in approximate inference with diffusion models to derive a lower bound on the maximum entropy objective. Additionally, we propose a policy iteration scheme that provably converges to the optimal diffusion policy. Our method enables the use of expressive diffusion-based policies while retaining the principled exploration benefits of MaxEnt-RL, significantly outperforming other diffusion-based methods on challenging high-dimensional control benchmarks. It is also competitive with state-of-the-art non-diffusion based RL methods while requiring fewer algorithmic design choices and smaller update-to-data ratios, reducing computational complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages main text, 18 pages all included</p></details> |

We introduce a novel framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, further enhanced by a tailored Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL). Our approach enables unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) to dynamically allocate tasks efficiently without necessitating central coordination in a 3D grid environment. The framework minimizes total travel time while simultaneously avoiding conflicts in task assignments. For the cost calculation and routing, we employ reservation-based A* and R* path planners. Experimental results revealed that our method achieves a high 92.5% conflict-free success rate, with only a 7.49% performance gap compared to the centralized Hungarian method, while outperforming the heuristic decentralized baseline based on greedy approach. Additionally, the framework exhibits scalability with up to 20 agents with allocation processing of 2.8 s and robustness in responding to dynamically generated tasks, underscoring its potential for real-world applications in complex multi-agent scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium (2025)</p></details> |

Despite its economic relevance, this trend largely overlooked the issue of credit card fraud detection. To address this gap, we propose a new threat model that demonstrates the limitations of existing attacks and highlights the necessity to investigate new approaches. We then design a new adversarial attack for credit card fraud detection, employing reinforcement learning to bypass classifiers. This attack, called FRAUD-RLA, is designed to maximize the attacker's reward by optimizing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff and working with significantly less required knowledge than competitors. Our experiments, conducted on three different heterogeneous datasets and against two fraud detection systems, indicate that FRAUD-RLA is effective, even considering the severe limitations imposed by our threat model.</p></details> |  |

Rather than focusing solely on traditional portfolio construction, our approach aims to improve an already high-performing strategy through dynamic rebalancing driven by PPO and Oracle agents. Our target is to enhance the traditional 60/40 benchmark (60% stocks, 40% bonds) by employing the Regret-based Sharpe reward function. To address the impact of transaction fee frictions and prevent signal loss, we develop a transaction cost scheduler. We introduce a future-looking reward function and employ synthetic data training through a circular block bootstrap method to facilitate the learning of generalizable allocation strategies. We focus on two key evaluation measures: return and maximum drawdown. Given the high stochasticity of financial markets, we train 20 independent agents each period and evaluate their average performance against the benchmark. Our method not only enhances the performance of the existing portfolio strategy through strategic rebalancing but also demonstrates strong results compared to other baselines.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) address this by enforcing safety constraints, yet existing methods either sacrifice reward maximization or allow unsafe training. We introduce Constrained Trust Region Policy Optimization (C-TRPO), which reshapes the policy space geometry to ensure trust regions contain only safe policies, guaranteeing constraint satisfaction throughout training. We analyze its theoretical properties and connections to TRPO, Natural Policy Gradient (NPG), and Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO). Experiments show that C-TRPO reduces constraint violations while maintaining competitive returns.</p></details> |  |
| **[ActSafe: Active Exploration with Safety Constraints for Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09486v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is ubiquitous in the development of modern AI systems. However, state-of-the-art RL agents require extensive, and potentially unsafe, interactions with their environments to learn effectively. These limitations confine RL agents to simulated environments, hindering their ability to learn directly in real-world settings. In this work, we present ActSafe, a novel model-based RL algorithm for safe and efficient exploration. ActSafe learns a well-calibrated probabilistic model of the system and plans optimistically w.r.t. the epistemic uncertainty about the unknown dynamics, while enforcing pessimism w.r.t. the safety constraints. Under regularity assumptions on the constraints and dynamics, we show that ActSafe guarantees safety during learning while also obtaining a near-optimal policy in finite time. In addition, we propose a practical variant of ActSafe that builds on latest model-based RL advancements and enables safe exploration even in high-dimensional settings such as visual control. We empirically show that ActSafe obtains state-of-the-art performance in difficult exploration tasks on standard safe deep RL benchmarks while ensuring safety during learning.</p></details> |  |

While recent approaches utilizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising results, their extensive computation and data demands limit the feasibility of local deployment and customization. To address this, we propose a novel CLIP-based multimodal parameter-efficient tuning (PET) framework designed for three language-guided object grounding and grasping tasks: (1) Referring Expression Segmentation (RES), (2) Referring Grasp Synthesis (RGS), and (3) Referring Grasp Affordance (RGA). Our approach introduces two key innovations: a bi-directional vision-language adapter that aligns multimodal inputs for pixel-level language understanding and a depth fusion branch that incorporates geometric cues to facilitate robot grasping predictions. Experiment results demonstrate superior performance in the RES object grounding task compared with existing CLIP-based full-model tuning or PET approaches. In the RGS and RGA tasks, our model not only effectively interprets object attributes based on simple language descriptions but also shows strong potential for comprehending complex spatial reasoning scenarios, such as multiple identical objects present in the workspace.

| **[Robotic Exploration using Generalized Behavioral Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10161v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents and evaluates a novel strategy for robotic exploration that leverages human models of uncertainty perception. To do this, we introduce a measure of uncertainty that we term "Behavioral entropy", which builds on Prelec's probability weighting from Behavioral Economics. We show that the new operator is an admissible generalized entropy, analyze its theoretical properties and compare it with other common formulations such as Shannon's and Renyi's. In particular, we discuss how the new formulation is more expressive in the sense of measures of sensitivity and perceptiveness to uncertainty introduced here. Then we use Behavioral entropy to define a new type of utility function that can guide a frontier-based environment exploration process. The approach's benefits are illustrated and compared in a Proof-of-Concept and ROS-Unity simulation environment with a Clearpath Warthog robot. We show that the robot equipped with Behavioral entropy explores faster than Shannon and Renyi entropies.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2024 IEEE.

This study introduces Echo-Teddy, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based social robot designed to support autistic students in developing social and communication skills. Unlike previous chatbot-based solutions, Echo-Teddy leverages advanced LLM capabilities to provide more natural and adaptive interactions. The research addresses two key questions: (1) What are the design principles and initial prototype characteristics of an effective LLM-based social robot for autistic students? (2) What improvements can be made based on developer reflection-on-action and expert interviews? The study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining prototype development with qualitative analysis of developer reflections and expert interviews. Key design principles identified include customizability, ethical considerations, and age-appropriate interactions. The initial prototype, built on a Raspberry Pi platform, features custom speech components and basic motor functions. Evaluation of the prototype revealed potential improvements in areas such as user interface, educational value, and practical implementation in educational settings. This research contributes to the growing field of AI-assisted special education by demonstrating the potential of LLM-based social robots in supporting autistic students. The findings provide valuable insights for future developments in accessible and effective social support tools for special education.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Synergistic, Generalized, and Efficient Dual-System for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08001v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for versatile robotic systems to operate in diverse and dynamic environments has emphasized the importance of a generalist policy, which leverages a large cross-embodiment data corpus to facilitate broad adaptability and high-level reasoning. However, the generalist would struggle with inefficient inference and cost-expensive training. The specialist policy, instead, is curated for specific domain data and excels at task-level precision with efficiency. Yet, it lacks the generalization capacity for a wide range of applications. Inspired by these observations, we introduce RoboDual, a synergistic dual-system that supplements the merits of both generalist and specialist policy. A diffusion transformer-based specialist is devised for multi-step action rollouts, exquisitely conditioned on the high-level task understanding and discretized action output of a vision-language-action (VLA) based generalist. Compared to OpenVLA, RoboDual achieves 26.7% improvement in real-world setting and 12% gain on CALVIN by introducing a specialist policy with merely 20M trainable parameters. It maintains strong performance with 5% of demonstration data only, and enables a 3.8 times higher control frequency in real-world deployment. Code would be made publicly available.

Collaborative robots, or cobots, commonly integrate six or more degrees of freedom (DOF) in a serial arm in order to allow positioning in constrained spaces and adaptability across tasks. Increasing the dexterity of robotic arms has been indeed traditionally accomplished by increasing the number of degrees of freedom of the system; however, once a robotic task has been established (e.g., a pick-and-place operation), the motion of the end-effector can be normally achieved using less than 6-DOF (i.e., lower mobility). The aim of malleable robots is to close the technological gap that separates current cobots from achieving flexible, accessible manufacturing automation with a reduced number of actuators.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 22 figures, chapter 7 of "Handbook on Soft Robotics"</p></details> |
| **[Oblivious Robots Under Round Robin: Gathering on Rings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03939v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots with very limited capabilities are placed on the vertices of a graph and are required to move toward a single, common vertex, where they remain stationary once they arrive. This task is referred to as the GATHERING problem. Most of the research on this topic has focused on feasibility challenges in the asynchronous setting, where robots operate independently of each other. A common assumption in these studies is that robots are equipped with multiplicity detection, the ability to recognize whether a vertex is occupied by more than one robot. Additionally, initial configurations are often restricted to ensure that no vertex hosts more than one robot. A key difficulty arises from the possible symmetries in the robots' placement relative to the graph's topology. This paper investigates the GATHERING problem on Rings under a sequential scheduler, where only one robot at a time is active. While this sequential activation helps to break symmetries, we remove two common assumptions: robots do not have multiplicity detection, and in initial configurations, vertices can be occupied by multiplicities. We prove that such a generalized GATHERING problem cannot be solved under general sequential schedulers. However, we provide a complete characterization of the problem when a sequential Round Robin scheduler is used, where robots are activated one at a time in a fixed cyclic order that repeats indefinitely. Furthermore, we fully characterize the DISTINCT GATHERING problem, the most used variant of GATHERING, in which the initial configurations do not admit multiplicities.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Flexible FBG-Based Contact Force Sensor for Robotic Gripping Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03914v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robotic grippers demonstrate great potential for gently and safely handling objects; however, their full potential for executing precise and secure grasping has been limited by the lack of integrated sensors, leading to problems such as slippage and excessive force exertion. To address this challenge, we present a small and highly sensitive Fiber Bragg Grating-based force sensor designed for accurate contact force measurement. The flexible force sensor comprises a 3D-printed TPU casing with a small bump and uvula structure, a dual FBG array, and a protective tube. A series of tests have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed force sensor, including force calibration, repeatability test, hysteresis study, force measurement comparison, and temperature calibration and compensation tests. The results demonstrated good repeatability, with a force measurement range of 4.69 N, a high sensitivity of approximately 1169.04 pm/N, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12 N, and a maximum hysteresis of 4.83%. When compared to a commercial load cell, the sensor showed a percentage error of 2.56% and an RMSE of 0.14 N. Besides, the proposed sensor validated its temperature compensation effectiveness, with a force RMSE of 0.01 N over a temperature change of 11 Celsius degree. The sensor was integrated with a soft grow-and-twine gripper to monitor interaction forces between different objects and the robotic gripper. Closed-loop force control was applied during automated pick-and-place tasks and significantly improved gripping stability, as demonstrated in tests. This force sensor can be used across manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare (like prosthetic hands), logistics, and packaging, to provide situation awareness and higher operational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional single-robot and multi-agent systems, MRS poses unique challenges, including coordination, scalability, and real-world adaptability. This survey provides the first comprehensive exploration of LLM integration into MRS. It systematically categorizes their applications across high-level task allocation, mid-level motion planning, low-level action generation, and human intervention. We highlight key applications in diverse domains, such as household robotics, construction, formation control, target tracking, and robot games, showcasing the versatility and transformative potential of LLMs in MRS. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that limit adapting LLMs in MRS, including mathematical reasoning limitations, hallucination, latency issues, and the need for robust benchmarking systems. Finally, we outline opportunities for future research, emphasizing advancements in fine-tuning, reasoning techniques, and task-specific models. This survey aims to guide researchers in the intelligence and real-world deployment of MRS powered by LLMs. Based on the fast-evolving nature of research in the field, we keep updating the papers in the open-source Github repository.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simultaneous Multi-Robot Motion Planning with Projected Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03607v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models hold significant potential in robotics, enabling the generation of diverse and smooth trajectories directly from raw representations of the environment. Despite this promise, applying diffusion models to motion planning remains challenging due to their difficulty in enforcing critical constraints, such as collision avoidance and kinematic feasibility. These limitations become even more pronounced in Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP), where multiple robots must coordinate in shared spaces. To address this challenge, this work proposes Simultaneous MRMP Diffusion (SMD), a novel approach integrating constrained optimization into the diffusion sampling process to produce collision-free, kinematically feasible trajectories. Additionally, the paper introduces a comprehensive MRMP benchmark to evaluate trajectory planning algorithms across scenarios with varying robot densities, obstacle complexities, and motion constraints. Experimental results show SMD consistently outperforms classical and learning-based motion planners, achieving higher success rates and efficiency in complex multi-robot environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Communication in Human-Robot Collaborative Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03346v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We focus on human-robot collaborative transport, in which a robot and a user collaboratively move an object to a goal pose. In the absence of explicit communication, this problem is challenging because it demands tight implicit coordination between two heterogeneous agents, who have very different sensing, actuation, and reasoning capabilities. Our key insight is that the two agents can coordinate fluently by encoding subtle, communicative signals into actions that affect the state of the transported object. To this end, we design an inference mechanism that probabilistically maps observations of joint actions executed by the two agents to a set of joint strategies of workspace traversal. Based on this mechanism, we define a cost representing the human's uncertainty over the unfolding traversal strategy and introduce it into a model predictive controller that balances between uncertainty minimization and efficiency maximization. We deploy our framework on a mobile manipulator (Hello Robot Stretch) and evaluate it in a within-subjects lab study (N=24). We show that our framework enables greater team performance and empowers the robot to be perceived as a significantly more fluent and competent partner compared to baselines lacking a communicative mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

While existing XR-based data collection systems provide efficient and intuitive solutions for large-scale data collection, they are often challenging to reproduce and reuse. This limitation arises because current systems are highly tailored to simulator-specific use cases and environments. IRIS is a novel, easily extendable framework that already supports multiple simulators, benchmarks, and even headsets. Furthermore, IRIS is able to include additional information from real-world sensors, such as point clouds captured through depth cameras. A unified scene specification is generated directly from simulators or real-world sensors and transmitted to XR headsets, creating identical scenes in XR. This specification allows IRIS to support any of the objects, assets, and robots provided by the simulators. In addition, IRIS introduces shared spatial anchors and a robust communication protocol that links simulations between multiple XR headsets. This feature enables multiple XR headsets to share a synchronized scene, facilitating collaborative and multi-user data collection. IRIS can be deployed on any device that supports the Unity Framework, encompassing the vast majority of commercially available headsets. In this work, IRIS was deployed and tested on the Meta Quest 3 and the HoloLens 2. IRIS showcased its versatility across a wide range of real-world and simulated scenarios, using current popular robot simulators such as MuJoCo, IsaacSim, CoppeliaSim, and Genesis. In addition, a user study evaluates IRIS on a data collection task for the LIBERO benchmark. The study shows that IRIS significantly outperforms the baseline in both objective and subjective metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fault-Tolerant Control for System Availability and Continuous Operation in Heavy-Duty Wheeled Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03278v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When the control system in a heavy-duty wheeled mobile robot (HD-WMR) malfunctions, deviations from ideal motion occur, significantly heightening the risks of off-road instability and costly damage. To meet the demands for safety, reliability, and controllability in HD-WMRs, the control system must tolerate faults to a certain extent, ensuring continuous operation. To this end, this paper introduces a model-free hierarchical control with fault accommodation (MFHCA) framework designed to address sensor and actuator faults in hydraulically powered HD-WMRs with independently controlled wheels. To begin, a novel mathematical representation of the motion dynamics of HD-WMRs, incorporating both sensor and actuator fault modes, is investigated. Subsequently, the MFHCA framework is proposed to manage all wheels under various fault modes, ensuring that each wheel tracks the reference driving velocities and steering angles, which are inverse kinematically mapped from the angular and linear velocities commanded in the HD-WMR's base frame. To do so, this framework generates appropriate power efforts in independently valve-regulated wheels to accommodate the adaptively isolated faults, thereby ensuring exponential stability. The experimental analysis of a 6,500-kg hydraulic-powered HD-WMR under various fault modes and rough terrains demonstrates the validity of the MFHCA framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under review by IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics (TMECH)</p></details> |

However, PVRs face critical challenges in the context of policy learning, including temporal entanglement and an inability to generalise even in the presence of minor scene perturbations. These limitations hinder performance in tasks requiring temporal awareness and robustness to scene changes. This work identifies these shortcomings and proposes solutions to address them. First, we augment PVR features with temporal perception and a sense of task completion, effectively disentangling them in time. Second, we introduce a module that learns to selectively attend to task-relevant local features, enhancing robustness when evaluated on out-of-distribution scenes. Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements, particularly in PVRs trained with masking objectives, and validate the effectiveness of our enhancements in addressing PVR-specific limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZISVFM: Zero-Shot Object Instance Segmentation in Indoor Robotic Environments with Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03266v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service robots operating in unstructured environments must effectively recognize and segment unknown objects to enhance their functionality. Traditional supervised learningbased segmentation techniques require extensive annotated datasets, which are impractical for the diversity of objects encountered in real-world scenarios. Unseen Object Instance Segmentation (UOIS) methods aim to address this by training models on synthetic data to generalize to novel objects, but they often suffer from the simulation-to-reality gap. This paper proposes a novel approach (ZISVFM) for solving UOIS by leveraging the powerful zero-shot capability of the segment anything model (SAM) and explicit visual representations from a selfsupervised vision transformer (ViT). The proposed framework operates in three stages: (1) generating object-agnostic mask proposals from colorized depth images using SAM, (2) refining these proposals using attention-based features from the selfsupervised ViT to filter non-object masks, and (3) applying K-Medoids clustering to generate point prompts that guide SAM towards precise object segmentation. Experimental validation on two benchmark datasets and a self-collected dataset demonstrates the superior performance of ZISVFM in complex environments, including hierarchical settings such as cabinets, drawers, and handheld objects.

Humanoid robots pose significant safety risks due to their physical capabilities of interacting with complex environments. The physical structures of humanoid robots further add complexity to the design of general safety solutions. To facilitate the safe deployment of complex robot systems, SPARK can be used as a toolbox that comes with state-of-the-art safe control algorithms in a modular and composable robot control framework. Users can easily configure safety criteria and sensitivity levels to optimize the balance between safety and performance. To accelerate humanoid safety research and development, SPARK provides a simulation benchmark that compares safety approaches in a variety of environments, tasks, and robot models. Furthermore, SPARK allows quick deployment of synthesized safe controllers on real robots. For hardware deployment, SPARK supports Apple Vision Pro (AVP) or a Motion Capture System as external sensors, while also offering interfaces for seamless integration with alternative hardware setups. This paper demonstrates SPARK's capability with both simulation experiments and case studies with a Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Leveraging these advantages of SPARK, users and researchers can significantly improve the safety of their humanoid systems as well as accelerate relevant research.

To address these limitations, we propose RoboGrasp, a universal grasping policy framework that integrates pretrained grasp detection models with robotic learning. By leveraging robust visual guidance from object detection and segmentation tasks, RoboGrasp significantly enhances grasp precision, stability, and generalizability, achieving up to 34% higher success rates in few-shot learning and grasping box prompt tasks. Built on diffusion-based methods, RoboGrasp is adaptable to various robotic learning paradigms, enabling precise and reliable manipulation across diverse and complex scenarios.

To address this issue, we first analyze and summarize eight types of damage scenarios, including sensor failures and joint malfunctions. Then, we propose a novel, model-free, two-stage training framework, Unified Malfunction Controller (UMC), incorporating a masking mechanism to enhance damage resilience. Specifically, the model is initially trained with normal environments to ensure robust performance under standard conditions. In the second stage, we use masks to prevent the legged robot from relying on malfunctioning limbs, enabling adaptive gait and movement adjustments upon malfunction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves the task completion capability by an average of 36% for the transformer and 39% for the MLP across three locomotion tasks.

| **[Demonstrating a Control Framework for Physical Human-Robot Interaction Toward Industrial Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02967v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) is critical for implementing Industry 5.0 which focuses on human-centric approaches. However, few studies explore the practical alignment of pHRI to industrial grade performance. This paper introduces a versatile control framework designed to bridge this gap by incorporating the torque-based control modes: compliance control, null-space compliance, dual compliance, all in static and dynamic scenarios. Thanks to our second-order Quadratic Programming (QP) formulation, strict kinematic and collision constraints are integrated into the system as safety features, and a weighted hierarchy guarantees singularity-robust task tracking performance. The framework is implemented on a Kinova Gen3 collaborative robot (cobot) equipped with a Bota force/torque sensor. A DualShock 4 game controller is attached at the robot's end-effector to demonstrate the framework's capabilities. This setup enables seamless dynamic switching between the modes, and real-time adjustment of parameters, such as transitioning between position and torque control or selecting a more robust custom-developed low-level torque controller over the default one.Built on the open-source robotic control software mc_rtc, to ensure reproducibility for both research and industrial deployment, this framework demonstrates industrial-grade performance and repeatability, showcasing its potential as a robust pHRI control system for industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Demo ...</summary><p>Demo Paper submitted to Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS2025), pending review</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Latent Representations in Behavior Cloning: An Information Bottleneck Approach for Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02853v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Behavior Cloning (BC) is a widely adopted visual imitation learning method in robot manipulation. Current BC approaches often enhance generalization by leveraging large datasets and incorporating additional visual and textual modalities to capture more diverse information. However, these methods overlook whether the learned representations contain redundant information and lack a solid theoretical foundation to guide the learning process. To address these limitations, we adopt an information-theoretic perspective and introduce mutual information to quantify and mitigate redundancy in latent representations. Building on this, we incorporate the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle into BC, which extends the idea of reducing redundancy by providing a structured framework for compressing irrelevant information while preserving task-relevant features. This work presents the first comprehensive study on redundancy in latent representations across various methods, backbones, and experimental settings, while extending the generalizability of the IB to BC. Extensive experiments and analyses on the CortexBench and LIBERO benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements with IB, underscoring the importance of reducing input data redundancy and highlighting its practical value for more practical applications.

Fully autonomous strategies may not generalize efficiently across this diversity. We propose leveraging feedback from the care recipient when encountering novel food items. However, frequent queries impose a workload on the user. We formulate human-in-the-loop bite acquisition within a contextual bandit framework and introduce LinUCB-QG, a method that selectively asks for help using a predictive model of querying workload based on query types and timings. This model is trained on data collected in an online study involving 14 participants with mobility limitations, 3 occupational therapists simulating physical limitations, and 89 participants without limitations. We demonstrate that our method better balances task performance and querying workload compared to autonomous and always-querying baselines and adjusts its querying behavior to account for higher workload in users with mobility limitations. We validate this through experiments in a simulated food dataset and a user study with 19 participants, including one with severe mobility limitations.

When two people carry a large, heavy object together, they coordinate through verbal communication about the intended movements and physical forces applied to the object. This natural integration of verbal and physical cues enables effective coordination. Similarly, human-robot interaction could achieve this level of coordination by integrating verbal and haptic communication modalities. This paper presents a framework for embedding words and force profiles in a unified manner, so that the two communication modalities can be integrated and coordinated in a way that is effective and synergistic. Here, it will be shown that, although language and physical force profiles are deemed completely different, the two can be embedded in a unified latent space and proximity between the two can be quantified. In this latent space, a force profile and words can a) supplement each other, b) integrate the individual effects, and c) substitute in an exchangeable manner. First, the need for cross-modality embedding is addressed, and the basic architecture and key building block technologies are presented. Methods for data collection and implementation challenges will be addressed, followed by experimental results and discussions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review in RSS 2025</p></details> |

Yet, the interaction design for these robots remains under-explored, particularly from the perspective of older adults. We present findings from a two-phase co-design process involving 13 older adults to uncover design principles for on-body robots for this population. We identify a rich spectrum of potential applications and characterize a design space to inform how on-body robots should be built for older adults. Our findings highlight the importance of considering factors like co-presence, embodiment, and multi-modal communication. Our work offers design insights to facilitate the integration of on-body robots into daily life and underscores the value of involving older adults in the co-design process to promote usability and acceptance of emerging wearable robotic technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable Composite Neural Signed Distance Fields for Robot Navigation in Dynamic Indoor Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02664v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) provide a differentiable environment representation to readily obtain collision checks and well-defined gradients for robot navigation tasks. However, updating neural SDFs as the scene evolves entails re-training, which is tedious, time consuming, and inefficient, making it unsuitable for robot navigation with limited field-of-view in dynamic environments. Towards this objective, we propose a compositional framework of neural SDFs to solve robot navigation in indoor environments using only an onboard RGB-D sensor. Our framework embodies a dual mode procedure for trajectory optimization, with different modes using complementary methods of modeling collision costs and collision avoidance gradients. The primary stage queries the robot body's SDF, swept along the route to goal, at the obstacle point cloud, enabling swift local optimization of trajectories. The secondary stage infers the visible scene's SDF by aligning and composing the SDF representations of its constituents, providing better informed costs and gradients for trajectory optimization. The dual mode procedure combines the best of both stages, achieving a success rate of 98%, 14.4% higher than baseline with comparable amortized plan time on iGibson 2.0. We also demonstrate its effectiveness in adapting to real-world indoor scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Null Space Compliance Approach for Maintaining Safety and Tracking Performance in Human-Robot Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02443v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the focus on developing robot manipulators has shifted towards prioritizing safety in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Impedance control is a typical approach for interaction control in collaboration tasks. However, such a control approach has two main limitations: 1) the end-effector (EE)'s limited compliance to adapt to unknown physical interactions, and 2) inability of the robot body to compliantly adapt to unknown physical interactions. In this work, we present an approach to address these drawbacks. We introduce a modified Cartesian impedance control method combined with a Dynamical System (DS)-based motion generator, aimed at enhancing the interaction capability of the EE without compromising main task tracking performance. This approach enables human coworkers to interact with the EE on-the-fly, e.g. tool changeover, after which the robot compliantly resumes its task. Additionally, combining with a new null space impedance control method enables the robot body to exhibit compliant behaviour in response to interactions, avoiding serious injuries from accidental contact while mitigating the impact on main task tracking performance. Finally, we prove the passivity of the system and validate the proposed approach through comprehensive comparative experiments on a 7 Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) KUKA LWR IV+ robot.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures |
| **[QUAR-VLA: Vision-Language-Action Model for Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14457v6)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The important manifestation of robot intelligence is the ability to naturally interact and autonomously make decisions. Traditional approaches to robot control often compartmentalize perception, planning, and decision-making, simplifying system design but limiting the synergy between different information streams. This compartmentalization poses challenges in achieving seamless autonomous reasoning, decision-making, and action execution. To address these limitations, a novel paradigm, named Vision-Language-Action tasks for QUAdruped Robots (QUAR-VLA), has been introduced in this paper. This approach tightly integrates visual information and instructions to generate executable actions, effectively merging perception, planning, and decision-making. The central idea is to elevate the overall intelligence of the robot. Within this framework, a notable challenge lies in aligning fine-grained instructions with visual perception information. This emphasizes the complexity involved in ensuring that the robot accurately interprets and acts upon detailed instructions in harmony with its visual observations. Consequently, we propose QUAdruped Robotic Transformer (QUART), a family of VLA models to integrate visual information and instructions from diverse modalities as input and generates executable actions for real-world robots and present QUAdruped Robot Dataset (QUARD), a large-scale multi-task dataset including navigation, complex terrain locomotion, and whole-body manipulation tasks for training QUART models. Our extensive evaluation (4000 evaluation trials) shows that our approach leads to performant robotic policies and enables QUART to obtain a range of emergent capabilities.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2024 |

Providing ultra-low latency, high data rates, and ubiquitous coverage and wireless connectivity, 5G fully unlocks the potential of robot autonomy and boosts emerging robotic applications, particularly in the domain of autonomous mobile robots. Ensuring seamless, efficient, and reliable navigation and operation of robots within a 5G network requires a clear understanding of the expected network quality in the deployment environment. However, obtaining real-time insights into network conditions, particularly in highly dynamic environments, presents a significant and practical challenge. In this paper, we present a novel framework for building a Network Digital Twin (NDT) using real-time data collected by robots. This framework provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring, controlling, and optimizing robotic operations in dynamic network environments. We develop a pipeline integrating robotic data into the NDT, demonstrating its evolution with real-world robotic traces. We evaluate its performances in radio-aware navigation use case, highlighting its potential to enhance energy efficiency and reliability for 5Genabled robotic operations.</p></details> |  |

While the performance of VLA models is promising, their computational cost can be substantial. This raises challenge for applying them on robotics tasks, which requires real-time decision-making to respond quickly to environmental changes. Since robotic control involves sequential decision-making, the visual input often exhibits minimal variation between successive steps. A natural idea is to reuse the computational results of unchanged visual tokens from the last step. Motivated by this idea, we propose VLA-Cache, an efficient vision-language-action model. VLA-Cache incorporates a token-selection mechanism that compares the visual input at each step with the input from the previous step, adaptively identifying visual tokens with minimal changes. The computational results for these unchanged tokens are then reused in subsequent steps via KV-cache, thereby significantly improving the efficiency of the VLA-Cache model. Experimental results on both simulation (e.g., LIBERO benchmark and SIMPLER) and real-world robot valid VLA-Cache can achieve practical acceleration with minimal sacrifice in success rate.</p></details> |  |

Parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential for higher speeds while maintaining the same energy limits due to their low moving masses. However, they require methods for contact detection and reaction while avoiding singularities and self-collisions. We address this issue and present SafePR - a unified approach for the detection and localization, including the distinction between collision and clamping to perform a reaction that is safe for humans and feasible for PRs. Our approach uses information from the encoders and motor currents to estimate forces via a generalized-momentum observer. Neural networks and particle filters classify and localize the contacts. We introduce reactions with redundancy resolution to avoid type-II singularities and self-collisions. Our approach detected and terminated 72 real-world collision and clamping contacts with end-effector speeds of up to 1.5 m/s, each within 25-275 ms. The forces were below the thresholds from ISO/TS 15066. By using built-in sensors, SafePR enables safe interaction with already assembled PRs without the need for new hardware components.</p></details> |  |

We apply this notion to analyze agent trajectories over time. We use dynamic time warping to measure trajectory similarity and compute the 0-dimensional persistent homology to identify relevant connected components, which, in our context, correspond to groups of similar trajectories. To track the evolution of these components across time, we compute induced matching distances, which preserve the coherence of their dynamic behavior. We then obtain a 1-dimensional signal that quantifies the consistency of trajectory groups over time. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively differentiates between various agent behaviors, highlighting its potential as a robust tool for topological analysis in robotics and related fields.</p></details> |  |

This creates a need for multimodal robot controllers that can operate across different types of information, including text. Large Language Models are able to process and generate textual as well as audiovisual data and, more recently, robot actions. Language Models are increasingly being applied to robotic systems; these Language-Based robots leverage the power of language models in a variety of ways. Additionally, the use of language opens up multiple forms of information exchange between members of a human-robot team. This survey motivates the use of language models in robotics, and then delineates works based on the part of the overall control flow in which language is incorporated. Language can be used by human to task a robot, by a robot to inform a human, between robots as a human-like communication medium, and internally for a robot's planning and control.

Furthermore, they are typically fine-tuned to replicate demonstrations collected by experts under different settings, thus introducing distribution bias and limiting their adaptability to diverse manipulation objectives, such as efficiency, safety, and task completion. To bridge this gap, we introduce GRAPE: Generalizing Robot Policy via Preference Alignment. Specifically, GRAPE aligns VLAs on a trajectory level and implicitly models reward from both successful and failure trials to boost generalizability to diverse tasks. Moreover, GRAPE breaks down complex manipulation tasks to independent stages and automatically guides preference modeling through customized spatiotemporal constraints with keypoints proposed by a large vision-language model. Notably, these constraints are flexible and can be customized to align the model with varying objectives, such as safety, efficiency, or task success. We evaluate GRAPE across a diverse array of tasks in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GRAPE enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLA models, increasing success rates on in-domain and unseen manipulation tasks by 51.79% and 58.20%, respectively. Additionally, GRAPE can be aligned with various objectives, such as safety and efficiency, reducing collision rates by 37.44% and rollout step-length by 11.15%, respectively.

One key factor affecting human-perception of robots are their sounds, especially the consequential sounds which robots (as machines) must produce as they operate. This paper explores qualitative responses from 182 participants to gain insight into human-perception of robot consequential sounds. Participants viewed videos of different robots performing their typical movements, and responded to an online survey regarding their perceptions of robots and the sounds they produce. Topic analysis was used to identify common properties of robot consequential sounds that participants expressed liking, disliking, wanting or wanting to avoid being produced by robots. Alongside expected reports of disliking high pitched and loud sounds, many participants preferred informative and audible sounds (over no sound) to provide predictability of purpose and trajectory of the robot. Rhythmic sounds were preferred over acute or continuous sounds, and many participants wanted more natural sounds (such as wind or cat purrs) in-place of machine-like noise. The results presented in this paper support future research on methods to improve consequential sounds produced by robots by highlighting features of sounds that cause negative perceptions, and providing insights into sound profile changes for improvement of human-perception of robots, thus enhancing human robot interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures - Accepted to be published in the conference proceedings for HRI'25 - the 20th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction.

Our approach leverages the interaction between two Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ANODEs) -- the Shape-NODE and Control-NODE -- to achieve continuous shape estimation and shape-aware control. The Shape-NODE integrates prior knowledge from Cosserat rod theory, allowing it to adapt and account for model mismatches, while the Control-NODE uses this shape information to optimize a whole-body control policy, trained in a Model Predictive Control (MPC) fashion. This unified framework effectively overcomes limitations of existing data-driven methods, such as poor shape awareness and challenges in capturing complex nonlinear dynamics. Extensive evaluations in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the framework's robust performance in shape estimation, trajectory tracking, and obstacle avoidance. The proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art end-to-end, Neural-ODE, and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, particularly in terms of tracking accuracy and generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

When operating these systems, real-time estimation and control require fast and accurate models. However, prediction with first-principles (FP) models is slow, and learned black-box models have poor generalizability. Physics-informed machine learning offers excellent advantages here, but it is currently limited to simple, often simulated systems without considering changes after training. We propose physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for articulated soft robots (ASRs) with a focus on data efficiency. The amount of expensive real-world training data is reduced to a minimum - one dataset in one system domain. Two hours of data in different domains are used for a comparison against two gold-standard approaches: In contrast to a recurrent neural network, the PINN provides a high generalizability. The prediction speed of an accurate FP model is improved with the PINN by up to a factor of 466 at slightly reduced accuracy. This enables nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) of the pneumatic ASR. In nine dynamic MPC experiments, an average joint-tracking error of 1.3{\deg} is achieved.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Energy Management for Autonomous Ground Robots on a Budget](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01858v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Ground Robots (AGRs) face significant challenges due to limited energy reserve, which restricts their overall performance and availability. Prior research has focused separately on energy-efficient approaches and fleet management strategies for task allocation to extend operational time. A fleet-level scheduler, however, assumes a specific energy consumption during task allocation, requiring the AGR to fully utilize the energy for maximum performance, which contrasts with energy-efficient practices. This paper addresses this gap by investigating the combined impact of computing frequency and locomotion speed on energy consumption and performance. We analyze these variables through experiments on our prototype AGR, laying the foundation for an integrated approach that optimizes cyber-physical resources within the constraints of a specified energy budget. To tackle this challenge, we introduce PECC (Predictable Energy Consumption Controller), a framework designed to optimize computing frequency and locomotion speed to maximize performance while ensuring the system operates within the specified energy budget. We conducted extensive experiments with PECC using a real AGR and in simulations, comparing it to an energy-efficient baseline. Our results show that the AGR travels up to 17\% faster than the baseline in real-world tests and up to 31\% faster in simulations, while consuming 95\% and 91\% of the given energy budget, respectively. These results prove that PECC can effectively enhance AGR performance in scenarios where prioritizing the energy budget outweighs the need for energy efficiency.</p></details> | 7 pages |

We introduce CoNav-Maze, a simulated robotics environment where a robot navigates using local perception while a human operator provides guidance based on an inaccurate map. The robot can share its camera views to improve the operator's understanding of the environment. To enable efficient human-robot cooperation, we propose Information Gain Monte Carlo Tree Search (IG-MCTS), an online planning algorithm that balances autonomous movement and informative communication. Central to IG-MCTS is a neural human perception dynamics model that estimates how humans distill information from robot communications. We collect a dataset through a crowdsourced mapping task in CoNav-Maze and train this model using a fully convolutional architecture with data augmentation. User studies show that IG-MCTS outperforms teleoperation and instruction-following baselines, achieving comparable task performance with significantly less communication and lower human cognitive load, as evidenced by eye-tracking metrics.</p></details> |  |

This paper identifies several key challenges for such collaborations, such as accurate recognition of human plan, robustness to disturbances, operational efficiency, adaptability to diverse user behaviors, and sustained human satisfaction. To address these challenges, we model the long-term HRC task through a hierarchical task graph and presents a novel multimodal and hierarchical framework to enable robots to better assist humans to advance on the task graph. In particular, the proposed multimodal framework integrates visual observations with speech commands to facilitate intuitive and flexible human-robot interactions. Additionally, our hierarchical designs for both human pose detection and plan prediction allow better understanding of human behaviors and significantly enhance system accuracy, robustness and flexibility. Moreover, an online adaptation mechanism enables real-time adjustment to diverse user behaviors. We deploy the proposed framework to KINOVA GEN3 robot and conduct extensive user studies on real-world long-term HRC assembly scenarios. Experimental results show that our approaches reduce task completion time by 15.9%, achieves an average task success rate of 91.8% and an overall user satisfaction score of 84% in long-term HRC tasks, showcasing its applicability in enhancing real-world long-term HRC.</p></details> |  |

By randomizing environment properties during training, the learned policy can become robust to uncertainties along the randomized dimensions. While the environment distribution is typically specified by hand, in this paper we investigate automatically discovering a sampling distribution via entropy-regularized reward maximization of a normalizing-flow-based neural sampling distribution. We show that this architecture is more flexible and provides greater robustness than existing approaches that learn simpler, parameterized sampling distributions, as demonstrated in six simulated and one real-world robotics domain. Lastly, we explore how these learned sampling distributions, combined with a privileged value function, can be used for out-of-distribution detection in an uncertainty-aware multi-step manipulation planner.</p></details> |  |

Although typically defined as utility-driven technologies designed for productive or social settings, the role of robots in creative settings remains underexplored. This paper examines how robots participate in artistic creation. Through semi-structured interviews with robotic artists, we analyze the impact of robots on artistic processes and outcomes. We identify the critical roles of social interaction, material properties, and temporal dynamics in facilitating creativity. Our findings reveal that creativity emerges from the co-constitution of artists, robots, and audiences within spatial-temporal dimensions. Based on these insights, we propose several implications for socially informed, material-attentive, and process-oriented approaches to creation with computing systems. These approaches can inform the domains of HCI, including media and art creation, craft, digital fabrication, and tangible computing.</p></details> | In press in CHI'25 |

However, current MoMa models are data-inefficient, underscoring the need for improved models that require realistic-sized benchmarks to evaluate their efficiency, which do not exist. To address this, we introduce the LAMBDA ({\lambda}) benchmark (Long-horizon Actions for Mobile-manipulation Benchmarking of Directed Activities), which evaluates the data efficiency of models on language-conditioned, long-horizon, multi-room, multi-floor, pick-and-place tasks using a dataset of manageable size, more feasible for collection. The benchmark includes 571 human-collected demonstrations that provide realism and diversity in simulated and real-world settings. Unlike planner-generated data, these trajectories offer natural variability and replay-verifiability, ensuring robust learning and evaluation. We benchmark several models, including learning-based models and a neuro-symbolic modular approach combining foundation models with task and motion planning. Learning-based models show suboptimal success rates, even when leveraging pretrained weights, underscoring significant data inefficiencies. However, the neuro-symbolic approach performs significantly better while being more data efficient. Findings highlight the need for more data-efficient learning-based MoMa approaches. {\lambda} addresses this gap by serving as a key benchmark for evaluating the data efficiency of those future models in handling household robotics tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, these policies often encounter challenges when deployed in real-world environments due to sim-to-real gaps, as simulators typically fail to replicate visual realism and complex real-world geometry. Moreover, the lack of realistic visual rendering limits the ability of these policies to support high-level tasks requiring RGB-based perception like ego-centric navigation. This paper presents a Real-to-Sim-to-Real framework that generates photorealistic and physically interactive "digital twin" simulation environments for visual navigation and locomotion learning. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based scene reconstruction from multi-view images and integrates these environments into simulations that support ego-centric visual perception and mesh-based physical interactions. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train a reinforcement learning policy within the simulator to perform a visual goal-tracking task. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves RGB-only sim-to-real policy transfer. Additionally, our framework facilitates the rapid adaptation of robot policies with effective exploration capability in complex new environments, highlighting its potential for applications in households and factories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://vr-robo.github.io/</p></details> |

This requires an accurate model of all obstacle shapes within the constrained robot cell, which is particularly challenging and time-consuming. The difficulty is heightened in flexible production lines, where the environment model must be updated each time the robot cell is modified. Furthermore, sensor-based methods often necessitate costly hardware and calibration procedures, and can be influenced by environmental factors (e.g., light conditions or reflections). To address these challenges, we present a novel data-driven approach to modeling a cluttered workspace, leveraging solely the robot internal joint encoders to capture exploratory motions. By computing the corresponding swept volume, we generate a (conservative) mesh of the environment that is subsequently used for collision checking within established path planning and control methods. Our method significantly reduces the complexity and cost of classical environment modeling by removing the need for CAD files and external sensors. We validate the approach with the KUKA LBR iisy collaborative robot in a pick-and-place scenario. In less than three minutes of exploratory robot motions and less than four additional minutes of computation time, we obtain an accurate model that enables collision-free motions. Our approach is intuitive, easy-to-use, making it accessible to users without specialized technical knowledge. It is applicable to all types of industrial robots or cobots.</p></details> | 7 pages, 10 figures |

Capability Communication Leads to More Natural Conversations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01448v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When encountering a robot in the wild, it is not inherently clear to human users what the robot's capabilities are. When encountering misunderstandings or problems in spoken interaction, robots often just apologize and move on, without additional effort to make sure the user understands what happened. We set out to compare the effect of two speech based capability communication strategies (proactive, reactive) to a robot without such a strategy, in regard to the user's rating of and their behavior during the interaction. For this, we conducted an in-person user study with 120 participants who had three speech-based interactions with a social robot in a restaurant setting. Our results suggest that users preferred the robot communicating its capabilities proactively and adjusted their behavior in those interactions, using a more conversational interaction style while also enjoying the interaction more.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at HRI '25 (the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction)</p></details> |
| **[Compliance while resisting: a shear-thickening fluid controller for physical human-robot interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01376v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is widely needed in many fields, such as industrial manipulation, home services, and medical rehabilitation, and puts higher demands on the safety of robots. Due to the uncertainty of the working environment, the pHRI may receive unexpected impact interference, which affects the safety and smoothness of the task execution. The commonly used linear admittance control (L-AC) can cope well with high-frequency small-amplitude noise, but for medium-frequency high-intensity impact, the effect is not as good. Inspired by the solid-liquid phase change nature of shear-thickening fluid, we propose a Shear-thickening Fluid Control (SFC) that can achieve both an easy human-robot collaboration and resistance to impact interference. The SFC's stability, passivity, and phase trajectory are analyzed in detail, the frequency and time domain properties are quantified, and parameter constraints in discrete control and coupled stability conditions are provided. We conducted simulations to compare the frequency and time domain characteristics of L-AC, nonlinear admittance controller (N-AC), and SFC, and validated their dynamic properties. In real-world experiments, we compared the performance of L-AC, N-AC, and SFC in both fixed and mobile manipulators. L-AC exhibits weak resistance to impact. N-AC can resist moderate impacts but not high-intensity ones, and may exhibit self-excited oscillations. In contrast, SFC demonstrated superior impact resistance and maintained stable collaboration, enhancing comfort in cooperative water delivery tasks. Additionally, a case study was conducted in a factory setting, further affirming the SFC's capability in facilitating human-robot collaborative manipulation and underscoring its potential in industrial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-free Lifelong Robot Learning with Retrieval-based Weighted Local Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02995v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental objective in intelligent robotics is to move towards lifelong learning robot that can learn and adapt to unseen scenarios over time. However, continually learning new tasks would introduce catastrophic forgetting problems due to data distribution shifts. To mitigate this, we store a subset of data from previous tasks and utilize it in two manners: leveraging experience replay to retain learned skills and applying a novel Retrieval-based Local Adaptation technique to restore relevant knowledge. Since a lifelong learning robot must operate in task-free scenarios, where task IDs and even boundaries are not available, our method performs effectively without relying on such information. We also incorporate a selective weighting mechanism to focus on the most "forgotten" skill segment, ensuring effective knowledge restoration. Experimental results across diverse manipulation tasks demonstrate that our framework provides a scalable paradigm for lifelong learning, enhancing robot performance in open-ended, task-free scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has emerged important since more repetitive and tiresome jobs are being done by robots. In the recent times, the field of soft robotics has seen a boom in the field of research and commercialization. The Industry 5.0 focuses on human robot collaboration which also spurs the field of soft robotics. However the HRI for soft robotics is still in the nascent stage. In this work we review and then discuss how HRI is done for soft robots. We first discuss the control, design, materials and manufacturing of soft robots. This will provide an understanding of what is being interacted with. Then we discuss about the various input and output modalities that are used in HRI. The applications where the HRI for soft robots are found in the literature are discussed in detail. Then the limitations of HRI for soft robots and various research opportunities that exist in this field are discussed in detail. It is concluded that there is a huge scope for development for HRI for soft robots.</p></details> | 53 pages, 3 figures |

As service robots become ubiquitous, understanding attitudes towards them at the population (vs. individual) level enables firms to expand robot services to a broad (vs. niche) market. Targeting population-level attitudes would benefit service firms because: (1) they are more persistent, thus, stronger predictors of behavioral patterns and (2) this approach is less reliant on personal data, whereas individualized services are vulnerable to AI-related privacy risks. As for service theory, ignoring broad unobserved differences in attitudes produces biased conclusions, and our systematic review of previous research highlights a poor understanding of potential heterogeneity in attitudes toward service robots. We present five diverse studies (S1-S5), utilizing multinational and "real world" data (Ntotal = 89,541; years: 2012-2024). Results reveal a stable structure comprising four distinct attitude profiles (S1-S5): positive ("adore"), negative ("abhor"), indifferent ("ignore"), and ambivalent ("unsure"). The psychological need for interacting with service staff, and for autonomy and relatedness in technology use, function as attitude profile antecedents (S2). Importantly, the attitude profiles predict differences in post-interaction discomfort and anxiety (S3), satisfaction ratings and service evaluations (S4), and perceived sociability and uncanniness based on a robot's humanlikeness (S5).</p></details> | in press |

In these scenarios, spatial awareness of the surroundings and the ability to localize the robot within the environment represent key aspects. While state-of-the-art localization techniques are well-explored in autonomous vehicles and walking robots, they rely on data retrieved with lidar or depth sensors which are bulky and thus difficult to integrate into small soft robots. Recent developments in miniaturized Time of Flight (ToF) sensors show promise as a small and lightweight alternative to bulky sensors. These sensors can be potentially distributed on the soft robot body, providing multi-point depth data of the surroundings. However, the small spatial resolution and the noisy measurements pose a challenge to the success of state-of-the-art localization algorithms, which are generally applied to much denser and more reliable measurements. In this paper, we enforce distributed VL53L5CX ToF sensors, mount them on the tip of a soft robot, and investigate their usage for self-localization tasks. Experimental results show that the soft robot can effectively be localized with respect to a known map, with an error comparable to the uncertainty on the measures provided by the miniaturized ToF sensors.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript has been accepted as a contributed paper for the 8th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Scalable, Training-Free Visual Language Robotics: A Modular Multi-Model Framework for Consumer-Grade GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01071v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of language instructions with robotic control, particularly through Vision Language Action (VLA) models, has shown significant potential. However, these systems are often hindered by high computational costs, the need for extensive retraining, and limited scalability, making them less accessible for widespread use. In this paper, we introduce SVLR (Scalable Visual Language Robotics), an open-source, modular framework that operates without the need for retraining, providing a scalable solution for robotic control. SVLR leverages a combination of lightweight, open-source AI models including the Vision-Language Model (VLM) Mini-InternVL, zero-shot image segmentation model CLIPSeg, Large Language Model Phi-3, and sentence similarity model all-MiniLM to process visual and language inputs. These models work together to identify objects in an unknown environment, use them as parameters for task execution, and generate a sequence of actions in response to natural language instructions. A key strength of SVLR is its scalability. The framework allows for easy integration of new robotic tasks and robots by simply adding text descriptions and task definitions, without the need for retraining. This modularity ensures that SVLR can continuously adapt to the latest advancements in AI technologies and support a wide range of robots and tasks. SVLR operates effectively on an NVIDIA RTX 2070 (mobile) GPU, demonstrating promising performance in executing pick-and-place tasks. While these initial results are encouraging, further evaluation across a broader set of tasks and comparisons with existing VLA models are needed to assess SVLR's generalization capabilities and performance in more complex scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-robot connective collaboration toward collective obstacle field traversal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11709v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environments with large terrain height variations present great challenges for legged robot locomotion. Drawing inspiration from fire ants' collective assembly behavior, we study strategies that can enable two ``connectable'' robots to collectively navigate over bumpy terrains with height variations larger than robot leg length. Each robot was designed to be extremely simple, with a cubical body and one rotary motor actuating four vertical peg legs that move in pairs. Two or more robots could physically connect to one another to enhance collective mobility. We performed locomotion experiments with a two-robot group, across an obstacle field filled with uniformly-distributed semi-spherical ``boulders''. Experimentally-measured robot speed suggested that the connection length between the robots has a significant effect on collective mobility: connection length C in [0.86, 0.9] robot unit body length (UBL) were able to produce sustainable movements across the obstacle field, whereas connection length C in [0.63, 0.84] and [0.92, 1.1] UBL resulted in low traversability. An energy landscape based model revealed the underlying mechanism of how connection length modulated collective mobility through the system's potential energy landscape, and informed adaptation strategies for the two-robot system to adapt their connection length for traversing obstacle fields with varying spatial frequencies. Our results demonstrated that by varying the connection configuration between the robots, the two-robot system could leverage mechanical intelligence to better utilize obstacle interaction forces and produce improved locomotion. Going forward, we envision that generalized principles of robot-environment coupling can inform design and control strategies for a large group of small robots to achieve ant-like collective environment negotiation.</p></details> |  |

However, the success comes at a cost. Their reliance on VLM backends with billions of parameters leads to high computational costs and inference latency, limiting the testing scenarios to mainly quasi-static tasks and hindering performance in dynamic tasks requiring rapid interactions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes HiRT, a Hierarchical Robot Transformer framework that enables flexible frequency and performance trade-off. HiRT keeps VLMs running at low frequencies to capture temporarily invariant features while enabling real-time interaction through a high-frequency vision-based policy guided by the slowly updated features. Experiment results in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods. Empirically, in static tasks, we double the control frequency and achieve comparable success rates. Additionally, on novel real-world dynamic ma nipulation tasks which are challenging for previous VLA models, HiRT improves the success rate from 48% to 75%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CORL 2024</p></details> |

However, existing methods are primarily designed for static environments and do not leverage the agent's own experiences to refine its initial plans. Given that real-world environments are inherently stochastic, initial plans based solely on LLMs' general knowledge may fail to achieve their objectives, unlike in static scenarios. To address this limitation, this study introduces the Experience-and-Emotion Map (E2Map), which integrates not only LLM knowledge but also the agent's real-world experiences, drawing inspiration from human emotional responses. The proposed methodology enables one-shot behavior adjustments by updating the E2Map based on the agent's experiences. Our evaluation in stochastic navigation environments, including both simulations and real-world scenarios, demonstrates that the proposed method significantly enhances performance in stochastic environments compared to existing LLM-based approaches.

While many robotic music systems aim to mimic human musicianship, our work emphasizes the unique strengths of robots, resulting in a novel multi-robot performance instrument called the Beatbots, capable of producing music that is challenging for humans to replicate using current methods. The Beatbots were designed using an ``informed prototyping'' process, incorporating feedback from three musicians throughout development. We evaluated the Beatbots through a live public performance, surveying participants (N=28) to understand how they perceived and interacted with the robotic performance. Results show that participants valued the playfulness of the experience, the aesthetics of the robot system, and the unconventional robot-generated music. Expert musicians and non-expert roboticists demonstrated especially positive mindset shifts during the performance, although participants across all demographics had favorable responses. We propose design principles to guide the development of future robotic music systems and identify key robotic music affordances that our musician consultants considered particularly important for robotic music performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright protected by IEEE/ACM, 10 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, in proceedings of 20th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI 2025)</p></details> |

Fast and accurate ball detection is crucial for enabling a robotic arm to rally the ball back successfully. So far, most table tennis robots use conventional, frame-based cameras for the perception pipeline. However, frame-based cameras suffer from motion blur if the frame rate is not high enough for fast-moving objects. Event-based cameras, on the other hand, do not have this drawback since pixels report changes in intensity asynchronously and independently, leading to an event stream with a temporal resolution on the order of us. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first real-time perception pipeline for a table tennis robot that uses only event-based cameras. We show that compared to a frame-based pipeline, event-based perception pipelines have an update rate which is an order of magnitude higher. This is beneficial for the estimation and prediction of the ball's position, velocity, and spin, resulting in lower mean errors and uncertainties. These improvements are an advantage for the robot control, which has to be fast, given the short time a table tennis ball is flying until the robot has to hit back.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

A hallmark of these systems is their bilayer structure, where strain mismatch caused by differential expansion between layers induces complex deformations. Despite progress in theoretical modeling and numerical simulation, accurately capturing their dynamic behavior, especially during environmental interactions, remains challenging. This study presents a novel simulation environment based on the Discrete Elastic Rod (DER) model to address the challenge. By leveraging discrete differential geometry (DDG), the DER approach offers superior convergence compared to conventional methods like Finite Element Method (FEM), particularly in handling contact interactions -- an essential aspect of soft robot dynamics in real-world scenarios. Our simulation framework incorporates key features of bilayer structures, including stretching, bending, twisting, and inter-layer coupling. This enables the exploration of a wide range of dynamic behaviors for bilayer soft robots, such as gripping, crawling, jumping, and swimming. The insights gained from this work provide a robust foundation for the design and control of advanced bilayer soft robotic systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

While internet-scale data are available for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) tasks to train Transformers, real-world mobility data are difficult to acquire with physical robots navigating off-road terrain. Furthermore, training techniques specifically designed to process text and image data in NLP and CV may not apply to robot mobility. In this paper, we propose VertiFormer, a novel data-efficient multi-task Transformer model trained with only one hour of data to address such challenges of applying Transformer architectures for robot mobility on extremely rugged, vertically challenging, off-road terrain. Specifically, VertiFormer employs a new learnable masked modeling and next token prediction paradigm to predict the next pose, action, and terrain patch to enable a variety of off-road mobility tasks simultaneously, e.g., forward and inverse kinodynamics modeling. The non-autoregressive design mitigates computational bottlenecks and error propagation associated with autoregressive models. VertiFormer's unified modality representation also enhances learning of diverse temporal mappings and state representations, which, combined with multiple objective functions, further improves model generalization. Our experiments offer insights into effectively utilizing Transformers for off-road robot mobility with limited data and demonstrate our efficiently trained Transformer can facilitate multiple off-road mobility tasks onboard a physical mobile robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 fig...</summary><p>9 figures, url: https://github.com/mhnazeri/VertiFormer</p></details> |

The new adaptive state tracking scheme is based on a recently-developed new discrete-time error model which has been used for gradient algorithm based state tracking control schemes, and uses the least-squares algorithm for parameter adaptation. The new least-squares algorithm is derived to minimize an accumulative estimation error, to ensure certain optimality for parameter estimation. The system stability and output tracking properties are studied. Technical results are presented in terms of plant-model matching, error model, adaptive law, optimality formulation, and stability and tracking analysis. The developed adaptive control scheme is applied to a discrete-time multiple mobile robot system to meet an adaptive state tracking objective. In addition, a collision avoidance mechanism is proposed to prevent collisions in the whole tracking process. Simulation results are presented, which verify the desired system state tracking properties under the developed least-squares algorithm based adaptive control scheme.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Coordination using Active Epistemic Inference for Multi-Robot Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03907v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Multi-robot system (MRS) provides significant advantages for intricate tasks such as environmental monitoring, underwater inspections, and space missions. However, addressing potential communication failures or the lack of communication infrastructure in these fields remains a challenge. A significant portion of MRS research presumes that the system can maintain communication with proximity constraints, but this approach does not solve situations where communication is either non-existent, unreliable, or poses a security risk. Some approaches tackle this issue using predictions about other robots while not communicating, but these methods generally only permit agents to utilize first-order reasoning, which involves reasoning based purely on their own observations. In contrast, to deal with this problem, our proposed framework utilizes Theory of Mind (ToM), employing higher-order reasoning by shifting a robot's perspective to reason about a belief of others observations. Our approach has two main phases: i) an efficient runtime plan adaptation using active inference to signal intentions and reason about a robot's own belief and the beliefs of others in the system, and ii) a hierarchical epistemic planning framework to iteratively reason about the current MRS mission state. The proposed framework outperforms greedy and first-order reasoning approaches and is validated using simulations and experiments with heterogeneous robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

The framework involves exploratory action selection to maximize learning about objects on a table. A Bayesian network models conditional dependencies between object properties, incorporating prior probability distributions and uncertainty associated with measurement actions. The algorithm selects optimal exploratory actions based on expected information gain and updates object properties through Bayesian inference. Experimental evaluation demonstrates effective action selection compared to a baseline and correct termination of the experiments if there is nothing more to be learned. The algorithm proved to behave intelligently when presented with trick objects with material properties in conflict with their appearance. The robot pipeline integrates with a logging module and an online database of objects, containing over 24,000 measurements of 63 objects with different grippers. All code and data are publicly available, facilitating automatic digitization of objects and their physical properties through exploratory manipulations.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Affordance-based Robot Manipulation with Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01083v4)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a framework for assistive robot manipulation, which focuses on two fundamental challenges: first, efficiently adapting large-scale models to downstream scene affordance understanding tasks, especially in daily living scenarios where gathering multi-task data involving humans requires strenuous effort; second, effectively learning robot action trajectories by grounding the visual affordance model. We tackle the first challenge by employing a parameter-efficient prompt tuning method that prepends learnable text prompts to the frozen vision model to predict manipulation affordances in multi-task scenarios. Then we propose to learn robot action trajectories guided by affordances in a supervised flow matching method. Flow matching represents a robot visuomotor policy as a conditional process of flowing random waypoints to desired robot action trajectories. Finally, we introduce a real-world dataset with 10 tasks across Activities of Daily Living to test our framework. Our extensive evaluation highlights that the proposed prompt tuning method for learning manipulation affordance achieves competitive performance and even outperforms some other finetuning protocols across data scales, while satisfying parameter efficiency. Learning multi-task robot action trajectories with flow matching leads to consistently favorable results in several robot manipulation benchmarks than some alternative behavior cloning methods. This includes more stable training and evaluation, and noticeably faster inference, while maintaining comparable generalization performance to diffusion policy, where flow matching performs marginally better in most cases. Our framework seamlessly unifies affordance learning and action generation with flow matching for robot manipulation.</p></details> |  |

Recent progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has shown that VLM-based task planners can alleviate the difficulty of solving novel tasks, by decomposing the compounded tasks as a plan of sequentially executing primitive-level skills that have been already mastered. It is also promising for robotic manipulation to adapt such composable generalization ability, in the form of composable generalization agents (CGAs). However, the community lacks of reliable design of primitive skills and a sufficient amount of primitive-level data annotations. Therefore, we propose RH20T-P, a primitive-level robotic manipulation dataset, which contains about 38k video clips covering 67 diverse manipulation tasks in real-world scenarios. Each clip is manually annotated according to a set of meticulously designed primitive skills that are common in robotic manipulation. Furthermore, we standardize a plan-execute CGA paradigm and implement an exemplar baseline called RA-P on our RH20T-P, whose positive performance on solving unseen tasks validates that the proposed dataset can offer composable generalization ability to robotic manipulation agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables.

This decomposition enables the reuse of learned skills in varying contexts and the combination of acquired skills to perform novel tasks, rather than merely replicating demonstrated motions. Gaze plays a critical role in human object manipulation, where it is strongly correlated with hand movements. We hypothesize that an imitating agent's gaze control, fixating on specific landmarks and transitioning between them, simultaneously segments demonstrated manipulations into sub-tasks. In this study, we propose a simple yet robust task decomposition method based on gaze transitions. The method leverages teleoperation, a common modality in robotic manipulation for collecting demonstrations, in which a human operator's gaze is measured and used for task decomposition as a substitute for an imitating agent's gaze. Notably, our method achieves consistent task decomposition across all demonstrations for each task, which is desirable in contexts such as machine learning. We applied this method to demonstrations of various tasks and evaluated the characteristics and consistency of the resulting sub-tasks. Furthermore, through extensive testing across a wide range of hyperparameter variations, we demonstrated that the proposed method possesses the robustness necessary for application to different robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

However, the value of taking each action can be ambiguous in robotics as robot movements are typically the aggregate result of executing multiple small actions. Moreover, robotic training data often consists of noisy trajectories, in which each action is noisy but executing a series of actions results in a meaningful robot movement. This further makes it difficult for the value function to understand the effect of individual actions. To address this, we introduce Coarse-to-fine Q-Network with Action Sequence (CQN-AS), a novel value-based RL algorithm that learns a critic network that outputs Q-values over a sequence of actions, i.e., explicitly training the value function to learn the consequence of executing action sequences. We study our algorithm on 53 robotic tasks with sparse and dense rewards, as well as with and without demonstrations, from BiGym, HumanoidBench, and RLBench. We find that CQN-AS outperforms various baselines, in particular on humanoid control tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 Pa...</summary><p>15 Pages.

While social robots have been explored as tools to enhance social connection through companionship, their potential as asynchronous social platforms for fostering connection towards humanity has received less attention. In this work, we introduce the design of a social support companion that facilitates the exchange of emotionally relevant stories and scaffolds reflection to enhance feelings of connection via five design dimensions. We investigate how social robots can serve as "social proxies" facilitating human stories, passing stories from other human narrators to the user. To this end, we conduct a real-world deployment of 40 robot stations in users' homes over the course of two weeks. Through thematic analysis of user interviews, we find that social proxy robots can foster connection towards other people's experiences via mechanisms such as identifying connections across stories or offering diverse perspectives.

However, Koopman operator-based models for soft robots are very high dimensional and require considerable amounts of data to properly resolve. Inspired by physics-informed techniques from machine learning, we present a novel physics-informed Koopman operator identification method that improves simulation accuracy for small dataset sizes. Through Strang splitting, the method takes advantage of both continuous and discrete Koopman operator approximation to obtain information both from trajectory and phase space data. The method is validated on a tendon-driven soft robotic arm, showing orders of magnitude improvement over standard methods in terms of the shape error. We envision this method can significantly reduce the data requirement of Koopman operators for systems with partially known physical models, and thus reduce the cost of obtaining data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Mobile Robot Navigation Using Hand-Drawn Maps: A Vision Language Model Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00114v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand-drawn maps can be used to convey navigation instructions between humans and robots in a natural and efficient manner. However, these maps can often contain inaccuracies such as scale distortions and missing landmarks which present challenges for mobile robot navigation. This paper introduces a novel Hand-drawn Map Navigation (HAM-Nav) architecture that leverages pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) for robot navigation across diverse environments, hand-drawing styles, and robot embodiments, even in the presence of map inaccuracies. HAM-Nav integrates a unique Selective Visual Association Prompting approach for topological map-based position estimation and navigation planning as well as a Predictive Navigation Plan Parser to infer missing landmarks. Extensive experiments were conducted in photorealistic simulated environments, using both wheeled and legged robots, demonstrating the effectiveness of HAM-Nav in terms of navigation success rates and Success weighted by Path Length. Furthermore, a user study in real-world environments highlighted the practical utility of hand-drawn maps for robot navigation as well as successful navigation outcomes.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Communication- and Computation-Efficient Distributed Submodular Optimization in Robot Mesh Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10382v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide a communication- and computation-efficient method for distributed submodular optimization in robot mesh networks. Submodularity is a property of diminishing returns that arises in active information gathering such as mapping, surveillance, and target tracking. Our method, Resource-Aware distributed Greedy (RAG), introduces a new distributed optimization paradigm that enables scalable and near-optimal action coordination. To this end, RAG requires each robot to make decisions based only on information received from and about their neighbors. In contrast, the current paradigms allow the relay of information about all robots across the network. As a result, RAG's decision-time scales linearly with the network size, while state-of-the-art near-optimal submodular optimization algorithms scale cubically. We also characterize how the designed mesh-network topology affects RAG's approximation performance. Our analysis implies that sparser networks favor scalability without proportionally compromising approximation performance: while RAG's decision time scales linearly with network size, the gain in approximation performance scales sublinearly. We demonstrate RAG's performance in simulated scenarios of area detection with up to 45 robots, simulating realistic robot-to-robot (r2r) communication speeds such as the 0.25 Mbps speed of the Digi XBee 3 Zigbee 3.0. In the simulations, RAG enables real-time planning, up to three orders of magnitude faster than competitive near-optimal algorithms, while also achieving superior mean coverage performance. To enable the simulations, we extend the high-fidelity and photo-realistic simulator AirSim by integrating a scalable collaborative autonomy pipeline to tens of robots and simulating r2r communication delays. Our code is available at https://github.com/UM-iRaL/Resource-Aware-Coordination-AirSim.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Attention Based Cognitive Human-Robot Collaboration for Pedicle Screw Placement in Robot-Assisted Orthopedic Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09359v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current orthopedic robotic systems largely focus on navigation, aiding surgeons in positioning a guiding tube but still requiring manual drilling and screw placement. The automation of this task not only demands high precision and safety due to the intricate physical interactions between the surgical tool and bone but also poses significant risks when executed without adequate human oversight. As it involves continuous physical interaction, the robot should collaborate with the surgeon, understand the human intent, and always include the surgeon in the loop. To achieve this, this paper proposes a new cognitive human-robot collaboration framework, including the intuitive AR-haptic human-robot interface, the visual-attention-based surgeon model, and the shared interaction control scheme for the robot. User studies on a robotic platform for orthopedic surgery are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the proposed human-robot collaboration framework outperforms full robot and full human control in terms of safety and ergonomics.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, in IROS 2024</p></details> |

Specifically, in the field of human-robot interaction, it becomes even more crucial to enable social robots to participate in such interactive contexts. However, it is usually implemented as a binary classification task, restricting the robot's capability to estimate whether it was addressed \review{or not, which} limits its interactive skills. For a social robot to gain the trust of humans, it is also important to manifest a certain level of transparency and explainability. Explainable artificial intelligence thus plays a significant role in the current machine learning applications and models, to provide explanations for their decisions besides excellent performance. In our work, we a) present an addressee estimation model with improved performance in comparison with the previous state-of-the-art; b) further modify this model to include inherently explainable attention-based segments; c) implement the explainable addressee estimation as part of a modular cognitive architecture for multi-party conversation in an iCub robot; d) validate the real-time performance of the explainable model in multi-party human-robot interaction; e) propose several ways to incorporate explainability and transparency in the aforementioned architecture; and f) perform an online user study to analyze the effect of various explanations on how human participants perceive the robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>32pp ...</summary><p>32pp (+6pp sup.mat.)

To achieve this goal, we introduce the Double Threshold Spiking neuron model with adjustable thresholds to generate varied output patterns. This neuron model can excite the natural dynamics of soft robotic snakes, and it enables distinct movements, such as turning or moving forward, by simply altering the neural thresholds. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach, termed SpikingSoft, naturally pairs and integrates with reinforcement learning. The high-level agent only needs to adjust the two thresholds to generate complex movement patterns, thus strongly simplifying the learning of reactive locomotion. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture significantly enhances the performance of the soft snake robot, enabling it to achieve target objectives with a 21.6% increase in success rate, a 29% reduction in time to reach the target, and smoother movements compared to the vanilla reinforcement learning controllers or Central Pattern Generator controller acting in torque space.</p></details> | <details><summary>8th I...</summary><p>8th IEEE-RAS International Conference on Soft Robotics</p></details> |

| **[Differentiable Simulation of Soft Robots with Frictional Contacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18956v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, soft robotics simulators have evolved to offer various functionalities, including the simulation of different material types (e.g., elastic, hyper-elastic) and actuation methods (e.g., pneumatic, cable-driven, servomotor). These simulators also provide tools for various tasks, such as calibration, design, and control. However, efficiently and accurately computing derivatives within these simulators remains a challenge, particularly in the presence of physical contact interactions. Incorporating these derivatives can, for instance, significantly improve the convergence speed of control methods like reinforcement learning and trajectory optimization, enable gradient-based techniques for design, or facilitate end-to-end machine-learning approaches for model reduction. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a unified method for computing the derivatives of mechanical equations within the finite element method framework, including contact interactions modeled as a nonlinear complementarity problem. The proposed approach handles both collision and friction phases, accounts for their nonsmooth dynamics, and leverages the sparsity introduced by mesh-based models. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through several examples of controlling and calibrating soft systems.</p></details> |  |

First, by constructing a network of environmental factor matrix to stimulate the learning process of the robot intelligent model, the model parameters must be subjected to coarse & fine tuning to optimize the loss function for minimizing the loss score, meanwhile robot intelligent model can fuse all previously known concepts together to represent things never experienced before, which need robot intelligent model can be generalized extensively. Secondly, in order to progressively develop a robot intelligent model with primary consciousness, every robot must be subjected to at least 1~3 years of special school for training anthropomorphic behaviour patterns to understand and process complex environmental information and make rational decisions. This work explores and delivers the potential application of deep learning-based quasi-consciousness training in the field of robot intelligent model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimum Time Strategies for a Differential Drive Robot Escaping from a Circular Detection Region](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18899v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Differential Drive Robot (DDR) located inside a circular detection region in the plane wants to escape from it in minimum time. Various robotics applications can be modeled like the previous problem, such as a DDR escaping as soon as possible from a forbidden/dangerous region in the plane or running out from the sensor footprint of an unmanned vehicle flying at a constant altitude. In this paper, we find the motion strategies to accomplish its goal under two scenarios. In one, the detection region moves slower than the DDR and seeks to prevent escape; in another, its position is fixed. We formulate the problem as a zero-sum pursuit-evasion game, and using differential games theory, we compute the players' time-optimal motion strategies. Given the DDR's speed advantage, it can always escape by translating away from the center of the detection region at maximum speed. In this work, we show that the previous strategy could be optimal in some cases; however, other motion strategies emerge based on the player's speed ratio and the players' initial configurations.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Our constructive framework couples control barrier function (CBF) theory with a new uncertainty estimator to ensure robust safety. We use the estimated uncertainty, along with a derived upper bound on the estimation error, for synthesizing CBFs and safety-critical controllers via a quadratic program-based feedback control law that rigorously ensures robust safety while improving disturbance rejection performance. We extend the method to higher-order CBFs (HOCBFs) to achieve safety under unmatched uncertainty, which may cause relative degree differences with respect to control input and disturbances. We assume the relative degree difference is at most one, resulting in a second-order cone constraint. We demonstrate the proposed robust HOCBF method through a simulation of an uncertain elastic actuator control problem and experimentally validate the efficacy of our robust CBF framework on a tracked robot with slope-induced matched and unmatched perturbations.</p></details> |  |

The proposed modified Clarke transform opens new opportunities in mechanical design and algorithmic approaches beyond the current limiting dependency on symmetric arranged joint locations. By presenting an encoder-decoder architecture based on the Clarke transform, joint values between different robot designs can be transformed enabling the use of an analogous robot design and direct knowledge transfer. To demonstrate its versatility, applications of control and trajectory generation in simulation are presented, which can be easily integrated into an existing framework designed, for instance, for three symmetric arranged joints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft 2025), 8 pages, 11 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> |

While significant progress has been made in robotic manipulation, existing approaches often fall short in generalization to complex environmental variations and addressing memory-dependent tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAM2Act, a multi-view robotic transformer-based policy that leverages multi-resolution upsampling with visual representations from large-scale foundation model. SAM2Act achieves a state-of-the-art average success rate of 86.8% across 18 tasks in the RLBench benchmark, and demonstrates robust generalization on The Colosseum benchmark, with only a 4.3% performance gap under diverse environmental perturbations. Building on this foundation, we propose SAM2Act+, a memory-based architecture inspired by SAM2, which incorporates a memory bank, an encoder, and an attention mechanism to enhance spatial memory. To address the need for evaluating memory-dependent tasks, we introduce MemoryBench, a novel benchmark designed to assess spatial memory and action recall in robotic manipulation. SAM2Act+ achieves competitive performance on MemoryBench, significantly outperforming existing approaches and pushing the boundaries of memory-enabled robotic systems.

However, directly adapting a pretrained VLM for robotic control remains challenging, particularly when constrained by a limited number of robot demonstrations. In this work, we introduce LLaRA: Large Language and Robotics Assistant, a framework that formulates robot action policy as visuo-textual conversations and enables an efficient transfer of a pretrained VLM into a powerful VLA, motivated by the success of visual instruction tuning in Computer Vision. First, we present an automated pipeline to generate conversation-style instruction tuning data for robots from existing behavior cloning datasets, aligning robotic actions with image pixel coordinates. Further, we enhance this dataset in a self-supervised manner by defining six auxiliary tasks, without requiring any additional action annotations. We show that a VLM finetuned with a limited amount of such datasets can produce meaningful action decisions for robotic control. Through experiments across multiple simulated and real-world tasks, we demonstrate that LLaRA achieves state-of-the-art performance while preserving the generalization capabilities of large language models.

The event brought together representatives from six regulatory and assurance bodies across diverse sectors to discuss challenges and evidence for ensuring the safety of autonomous and robotic systems, particularly autonomous inspection robots (AIR). The workshop featured six invited talks by the regulatory and assurance bodies. CRADLE aims to make assurance an integral part of engineering reliable, transparent, and trustworthy autonomous systems. Key discussions revolved around three research questions: (i) challenges in assuring safety for AIR; (ii) evidence for safety assurance; and (iii) how assurance cases need to differ for autonomous systems. Following the invited talks, the breakout groups further discussed the research questions using case studies from ground (rail), nuclear, underwater, and drone-based AIR. This workshop offered a valuable opportunity for representatives from industry, academia, and regulatory bodies to discuss challenges related to assured autonomy. Feedback from participants indicated a strong willingness to adopt a design-for-assurance process to ensure that robots are developed and verified to meet regulatory expectations.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Dual-BEV Nav: Dual-layer BEV-based Heuristic Path Planning for Robotic Navigation in Unstructured Outdoor Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18351v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Path planning with strong environmental adaptability plays a crucial role in robotic navigation in unstructured outdoor environments, especially in the case of low-quality location and map information. The path planning ability of a robot depends on the identification of the traversability of global and local ground areas. In real-world scenarios, the complexity of outdoor open environments makes it difficult for robots to identify the traversability of ground areas that lack a clearly defined structure. Moreover, most existing methods have rarely analyzed the integration of local and global traversability identifications in unstructured outdoor scenarios. To address this problem, we propose a novel method, Dual-BEV Nav, first introducing Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations into local planning to generate high-quality traversable paths. Then, these paths are projected onto the global traversability map generated by the global BEV planning model to obtain the optimal waypoints. By integrating the traversability from both local and global BEV, we establish a dual-layer BEV heuristic planning paradigm, enabling long-distance navigation in unstructured outdoor environments. We test our approach through both public dataset evaluations and real-world robot deployments, yielding promising results. Compared to baselines, the Dual-BEV Nav improved temporal distance prediction accuracy by up to $18.7\%$. In the real-world deployment, under conditions significantly different from the training set and with notable occlusions in the global BEV, the Dual-BEV Nav successfully achieved a 65-meter-long outdoor navigation. Further analysis demonstrates that the local BEV representation significantly enhances the rationality of the planning, while the global BEV probability map ensures the robustness of the overall planning.</p></details> |  |

We provide a separation of the physical and computational aspects of a robotic system, allowing us to decouple the problems related to each and directly use methods from control theory and distributed computing, fields that are traditionally distant in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate a novel approach for reasoning about the knowledge in multi-robot systems through a principled method of converting a switched hybrid dynamical system into a temporal-epistemic logic model, passing through an abstract state machine representation. This creates space for methods and results to be exchanged across the fields of control theory, distributed computing and temporal-epistemic logic, while reasoning about multi-robot systems.</p></details> |  |

Various studies have aimed to clarify the factors that influence the development of user trust. In Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) environments, a critical aspect of trust development is the robot's ability to make its behavior understandable. The concept of an eXplainable Autonomous Robot (XAR) addresses this requirement. However, giving a robot self-explanatory abilities is a complex task. Robot behavior includes multiple skills and diverse subsystems. This complexity led to research into a wide range of methods for generating explanations about robot behavior. This paper presents a systematic literature review that analyzes existing strategies for generating explanations in robots and studies the current XAR trends. Results indicate promising advancements in explainability systems. However, these systems are still unable to fully cover the complex behavior of autonomous robots. Furthermore, we also identify a lack of consensus on the theoretical concept of explainability, and the need for a robust methodology to assess explainability methods and tools has been identified.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, 10 tables.

At its core, there is a learning process which estimates the perturbations induced by the model uncertainty on the active and passive degrees of freedom. The generic iteration of the algorithm makes use of the learned data in both the planning phase, which is based on optimization, and the control phase, where partial feedback linearization of the active dofs is performed on the model updated on-line. The performance of the proposed approach is shown by comparative simulations and experiments on a Pendubot executing various types of swing-up maneuvers. Very few iterations are typically needed to generate dynamically feasible trajectories and the tracking control that guarantees their accurate execution, even in the presence of large model uncertainties.</p></details> |  |

Our proposed framework comprises of dynamic point removal, multi-session map alignment, map change detection and map version control. First, our sensor-setup agnostic dynamic point removal algorithm works seamlessly with both hand-held and robot-mounted setups to produce clean static 3D maps. Second, the multi-session map alignment aligns these clean static maps automatically, without manual parameter fine-tuning, into a single reference frame, using a two stage approach based on feature descriptor matching and fine registration. Third, our novel map change detection identifies positive and negative changes between two aligned maps. Finally, the map version control maintains a single base map that represents the current state of the environment, and stores the detected positive and negative changes, and boundary information. Our unique map version control system can reconstruct any of the previous clean session maps and allows users to query changes between any two random mapping sessions, all without storing any input raw session maps, making it very unique. Extensive experiments are performed using hand-held commercial LiDAR mapping devices and open-source robot-mounted LiDAR SLAM algorithms to evaluate each module and the whole 3D lifelong mapping framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Robust Optimization for Multi-Agent Robotic Systems: A Distributed Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16227v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel distributed robust optimization scheme for steering distributions of multi-agent systems under stochastic and deterministic uncertainty. Robust optimization is a subfield of optimization which aims to discover an optimal solution that remains robustly feasible for all possible realizations of the problem parameters within a given uncertainty set. Such approaches would naturally constitute an ideal candidate for multi-robot control, where in addition to stochastic noise, there might be exogenous deterministic disturbances. Nevertheless, as these methods are usually associated with significantly high computational demands, their application to multi-agent robotics has remained limited. The scope of this work is to propose a scalable robust optimization framework that effectively addresses both types of uncertainties, while retaining computational efficiency and scalability. In this direction, we provide tractable approximations for robust constraints that are relevant in multi-robot settings. Subsequently, we demonstrate how computations can be distributed through an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) approach towards achieving scalability and communication efficiency. All improvements are also theoretically justified by establishing and comparing the resulting computational complexities. Simulation results highlight the performance of the proposed algorithm in effectively handling both stochastic and deterministic uncertainty in multi-robot systems. The scalability of the method is also emphasized by showcasing tasks with up to hundreds of agents. The results of this work indicate the promise of blending robust optimization, distribution steering and distributed optimization towards achieving scalable, safe and robust multi-robot control.</p></details> |  |

However, these robots remain challenging to model and control due to the complex interplay of the inflated structure and inextensible materials, which leads to obstacles for autonomous operation and design optimization. Although there exist simulators for these systems that have achieved qualitative and quantitative success in matching high-level behavior, they still often fail to capture realistic vine robot shapes using simplified parameter models and have difficulties in high-throughput simulation necessary for planning and parameter optimization. We propose a differentiable simulator for these systems, enabling the use of the simulator "in-the-loop" of gradient-based optimization approaches to address the issues listed above. With the more complex parameter fitting made possible by this approach, we experimentally validate and integrate a closed-form nonlinear stiffness model for thin-walled inflated tubes based on a first-principles approach to local material wrinkling. Our simulator also takes advantage of data-parallel operations by leveraging existing differentiable computation frameworks, allowing multiple simultaneous rollouts. We demonstrate the feasibility of using a physics-grounded nonlinear stiffness model within our simulator, and how it can be an effective tool in sim-to-real transfer.

In physical tasks such as handover, bathing, dressing, and rehabilitation, a key aspect of this diversity is the functional range of motion (fROM), which can vary significantly between individuals. In this work, we learn to predict personalized fROM as a way to generalize robot decision-making in a wide range of caregiving tasks. We propose a novel data-driven method for predicting personalized fROM using functional assessment scores from occupational therapy. We develop a neural model that learns to embed functional assessment scores into a latent representation of the user's physical function. The model is trained using motion capture data collected from users with emulated mobility limitations. After training, the model predicts personalized fROM for new users without motion capture. Through simulated experiments and a real-robot user study, we show that the personalized fROM predictions from our model enable the robot to provide personalized and effective assistance while improving the user's agency in action.

| **[Accelerating Model Predictive Control for Legged Robots through Distributed Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11742v5)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach to enhance Model Predictive Control (MPC) for legged robots through Distributed Optimization. Our method focuses on decomposing the robot dynamics into smaller, parallelizable subsystems, and utilizing the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to ensure consensus among them. Each subsystem is managed by its own Optimal Control Problem, with ADMM facilitating consistency between their optimizations. This approach not only decreases the computational time but also allows for effective scaling with more complex robot configurations, facilitating the integration of additional subsystems such as articulated arms on a quadruped robot. We demonstrate, through numerical evaluations, the convergence of our approach on two systems with increasing complexity. In addition, we showcase that our approach converges towards the same solution when compared to a state-of-the-art centralized whole-body MPC implementation. Moreover, we quantitatively compare the computational efficiency of our method to the centralized approach, revealing up to a 75% reduction in computational time. Overall, our approach offers a promising avenue for accelerating MPC solutions for legged robots, paving the way for more effective utilization of the computational performance of modern hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[SafeSteps: Learning Safer Footstep Planning Policies for Legged Robots via Model-Based Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12664v4)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a footstep planning policy for quadrupedal locomotion that is able to directly take into consideration a-priori safety information in its decisions. At its core, a learning process analyzes terrain patches, classifying each landing location by its kinematic feasibility, shin collision, and terrain roughness. This information is then encoded into a small vector representation and passed as an additional state to the footstep planning policy, which furthermore proposes only safe footstep location by applying a masked variant of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm. The performance of the proposed approach is shown by comparative simulations and experiments on an electric quadruped robot walking in different rough terrain scenarios. We show that violations of the above safety conditions are greatly reduced both during training and the successive deployment of the policy, resulting in an inherently safer footstep planner. Furthermore, we show how, as a byproduct, fewer reward terms are needed to shape the behavior of the policy, which in return is able to achieve both better final performances and sample efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2023 IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids)</p></details> |
| **[CLIP-Motion: Learning Reward Functions for Robotic Actions Using Consecutive Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03485v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel method for learning reward functions for robotic motions by harnessing the power of a CLIP-based model. Traditional reward function design often hinges on manual feature engineering, which can struggle to generalize across an array of tasks. Our approach circumvents this challenge by capitalizing on CLIP's capability to process both state features and image inputs effectively. Given a pair of consecutive observations, our model excels in identifying the motion executed between them. We showcase results spanning various robotic activities, such as directing a gripper to a designated target and adjusting the position of a cube. Through experimental evaluations, we underline the proficiency of our method in precisely deducing motion and its promise to enhance reinforcement learning training in the realm of robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Planning with Vision-Language Models and a Use Case in Robot-Assisted Teaching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17665v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating the generation of Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) with Large Language Model (LLM) opens new research topic in AI planning, particularly for complex real-world tasks. This paper introduces Image2PDDL, a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automatically convert images of initial states and descriptions of goal states into PDDL problems. By providing a PDDL domain alongside visual inputs, Imasge2PDDL addresses key challenges in bridging perceptual understanding with symbolic planning, reducing the expertise required to create structured problem instances, and improving scalability across tasks of varying complexity. We evaluate the framework on various domains, including standard planning domains like blocksworld and sliding tile puzzles, using datasets with multiple difficulty levels. Performance is assessed on syntax correctness, ensuring grammar and executability, and content correctness, verifying accurate state representation in generated PDDL problems. The proposed approach demonstrates promising results across diverse task complexities, suggesting its potential for broader applications in AI planning. We will discuss a potential use case in robot-assisted teaching of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian BIM-Guided Construction Robot Navigation with NLP Safety Prompts in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17437v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Construction robotics increasingly relies on natural language processing for task execution, creating a need for robust methods to interpret commands in complex, dynamic environments. While existing research primarily focuses on what tasks robots should perform, less attention has been paid to how these tasks should be executed safely and efficiently. This paper presents a novel probabilistic framework that uses sentiment analysis from natural language commands to dynamically adjust robot navigation policies in construction environments. The framework leverages Building Information Modeling (BIM) data and natural language prompts to create adaptive navigation strategies that account for varying levels of environmental risk and uncertainty. We introduce an object-aware path planning approach that combines exponential potential fields with a grid-based representation of the environment, where the potential fields are dynamically adjusted based on the semantic analysis of user prompts. The framework employs Bayesian inference to consolidate multiple information sources: the static data from BIM, the semantic content of natural language commands, and the implied safety constraints from user prompts. We demonstrate our approach through experiments comparing three scenarios: baseline shortest-path planning, safety-oriented navigation, and risk-aware routing. Results show that our method successfully adapts path planning based on natural language sentiment, achieving a 50\% improvement in minimum distance to obstacles when safety is prioritized, while maintaining reasonable path lengths. Scenarios with contrasting prompts, such as "dangerous" and "safe", demonstrate the framework's ability to modify paths. This approach provides a flexible foundation for integrating human knowledge and safety considerations into construction robot navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction (ISARC)</p></details> |
| **[From Decision to Action in Surgical Autonomy: Multi-Modal Large Language Models for Robot-Assisted Blood Suction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07806v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has impacted research in robotics and automation. While progress has been made in integrating LLMs into general robotics tasks, a noticeable void persists in their adoption in more specific domains such as surgery, where critical factors such as reasoning, explainability, and safety are paramount. Achieving autonomy in robotic surgery, which entails the ability to reason and adapt to changes in the environment, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a multi-modal LLM integration in robot-assisted surgery for autonomous blood suction. The reasoning and prioritization are delegated to the higher-level task-planning LLM, and the motion planning and execution are handled by the lower-level deep reinforcement learning model, creating a distributed agency between the two components. As surgical operations are highly dynamic and may encounter unforeseen circumstances, blood clots and active bleeding were introduced to influence decision-making. Results showed that using a multi-modal LLM as a higher-level reasoning unit can account for these surgical complexities to achieve a level of reasoning previously unattainable in robot-assisted surgeries. These findings demonstrate the potential of multi-modal LLMs to significantly enhance contextual understanding and decision-making in robotic-assisted surgeries, marking a step toward autonomous surgical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Safe and Trustworthy Robot Pathfinding with BIM, MHA*, and NLP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15371v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Construction robots have gained significant traction in recent years in research and development. However, the application of industrial robots has unique challenges. Dynamic environments, domain-specific tasks, and complex localization and mapping are significant obstacles in their development. In construction job sites, moving objects and complex machinery can make pathfinding a difficult task due to the possibility of object collisions. Existing methods such as simultaneous localization and mapping are viable solutions to this problem, however, due to the precision and data quality required by the sensors and the processing of the information, they can be very computationally expensive. We propose using spatial and semantic information in building information modeling (BIM) to develop domain-specific pathfinding strategies. In this work, we integrate a multi-heuristic A* (MHA*) algorithm using APFs from the BIM spatial information and process textual information from the BIM using large language models (LLMs) to adjust the algorithm for dynamic object avoidance. We show increased robot object proximity by 80% while maintaining similar path lengths.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Access</p></details> |

The robot features a range of sensors, including barometric tactile sensors in its hands, to facilitate precise environmental interaction. This is demonstrated through an experiment showcasing the robot's ability to control a medical needle's movement through soft material. Surena-V's operational framework emphasizes stability and collaboration, employing various optimization-based control strategies such as Zero Moment Point (ZMP) modification through upper body movement and stepping. Notably, the robot's interaction with the environment is improved by detecting and interpreting external forces at their point of effect, allowing for more agile responses compared to methods that control overall balance based on external forces. The efficacy of this architecture is substantiated through an experiment illustrating the robot's collaboration with a human in moving a bar. This work contributes to the field of humanoid robotics by presenting a comprehensive system design and control architecture focused on human-robot collaboration and environmental adaptability.</p></details> |  |
