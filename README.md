| **[Action Deviation-Aware Inference for Low-Latency Wireless Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02851v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML with computational resources in mobile, edge, and cloud connected over hyper-reliable low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: a lightweight on-device model locally generates drafts while a more capable remote target model on a server verifies and corrects them in parallel with speculative sampling, thus resulting in lower latency without compromising accuracy. However, unlike autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for embodied AI applications, cannot parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each generated action depends on observation updated by a previous action. To this end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference (ADAHI), wherein drafts are selectively transmitted and verified based on action deviation, which has a strong correlation with action's rejection probability by the target model. By invoking server operation only when necessary, communication and computational overhead can be reduced while accuracy gain from speculative sampling is preserved. Experiments on our testbed show that ADAHI reduces transmission and server operations by approximately 40%, lowers end-to-end latency by 39.2%, and attains up to 97.2% of the task-success rate of baseline that invokes speculative sampling for every draft embedding vector.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhysCorr: Dual-Reward DPO for Physics-Constrained Text-to-Video Generation with Automated Preference Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03997v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics, incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel direct preference optimization pipeline that leverages contrastive feedback and physics-aware reweighting to guide generation toward physically coherent outputs. Our approach is model-agnostic and scalable, enabling seamless integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving visual fidelity and semantic alignment. This work takes a critical step toward physically grounded and trustworthy video generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaRF: Enhancing Multi-View Consistency in Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03992v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically, CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization. Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively. Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and autonomous perception.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROSBag MCP Server: Analyzing Robot Data with LLMs for Agentic Embodied AI Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03497v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key research verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, with Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and enabler of agentic applications. However, the literature at the intersection of these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through LLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time series data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2 CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source (through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both proprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools available to the models.

| **[EQ-Negotiator: Dynamic Emotional Personas Empower Small Language Models for Edge-Deployable Credit Negotiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03370v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in automated negotiation has set a high performance benchmark, but their computational cost and data privacy requirements render them unsuitable for many privacy-sensitive, on-device applications such as mobile assistants, embodied AI agents or private client interactions. While small language models (SLMs) offer a practical alternative, they suffer from a significant performance gap compared to LLMs in playing emotionally charged complex personas, especially for credit negotiation. This paper introduces EQ-Negotiator, a novel framework that bridges this capability gap using emotional personas. Its core is a reasoning system that integrates game theory with a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) to learn and track debtor emotional states online, without pre-training. This allows EQ-Negotiator to equip SLMs with the strategic intelligence to counter manipulation while de-escalating conflict and upholding ethical standards. Through extensive agent-to-agent simulations across diverse credit negotiation scenarios, including adversarial debtor strategies like cheating, threatening, and playing the victim, we show that a 7B parameter language model with EQ-Negotiator achieves better debt recovery and negotiation efficiency than baseline LLMs more than 10 times its size. This work advances persona modeling from descriptive character profiles to dynamic emotional architectures that operate within privacy constraints. Besides, this paper establishes that strategic emotional intelligence, not raw model scale, is the critical factor for success in automated negotiation, paving the way for effective, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI negotiators that can operate on the edge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Communicating Plans, Not Percepts: Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination with Embodied World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02912v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), which uses the agent's own policy to simulate future states. A Message Generation Network (MGN) then compresses this plan into a message. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems, while scaling environmental complexity. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA).

| **[Learning Interactive World Model for Object-Centric Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02225v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents that understand objects and their interactions can learn policies that are more robust and transferable. However, most object-centric RL methods factor state by individual objects while leaving interactions implicit. We introduce the Factored Interactive Object-Centric World Model (FIOC-WM), a unified framework that learns structured representations of both objects and their interactions within a world model. FIOC-WM captures environment dynamics with disentangled and modular representations of object interactions, improving sample efficiency and generalization for policy learning. Concretely, FIOC-WM first learns object-centric latents and an interaction structure directly from pixels, leveraging pre-trained vision encoders. The learned world model then decomposes tasks into composable interaction primitives, and a hierarchical policy is trained on top: a high level selects the type and order of interactions, while a low level executes them. On simulated robotic and embodied-AI benchmarks, FIOC-WM improves policy-learning sample efficiency and generalization over world-model baselines, indicating that explicit, modular interaction learning is crucial for robust control.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[URDF-Anything: Constructing Articulated Objects with 3D Multimodal Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00940v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing accurate digital twins of articulated objects is essential for robotic simulation training and embodied AI world model building, yet historically requires painstaking manual modeling or multi-stage pipelines. In this work, we propose \textbf{URDF-Anything}, an end-to-end automatic reconstruction framework based on a 3D multimodal large language model (MLLM). URDF-Anything utilizes an autoregressive prediction framework based on point-cloud and text multimodal input to jointly optimize geometric segmentation and kinematic parameter prediction. It implements a specialized $[SEG]$ token mechanism that interacts directly with point cloud features, enabling fine-grained part-level segmentation while maintaining consistency with the kinematic parameter predictions. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches regarding geometric segmentation (mIoU 17\% improvement), kinematic parameter prediction (average error reduction of 29\%), and physical executability (surpassing baselines by 50\%). Notably, our method exhibits excellent generalization ability, performing well even on objects outside the training set. This work provides an efficient solution for constructing digital twins for robotic simulation, significantly enhancing the sim-to-real transfer capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Spatial Reasoning in the Large Model Era: A Survey and Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25760v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However, systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space. We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated information about this survey, codes and implementation of the open benchmarks can be found at https://github.com/zhengxuJosh/Awesome-Spatial-Reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Modal Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Spatial Reasoning-Based Visual Grounding in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27033v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual reasoning, particularly spatial reasoning, is a challenging cognitive task that requires understanding object relationships and their interactions within complex environments, especially in robotics domain. Existing vision_language models (VLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with fine-grained spatial reasoning due to their implicit, correlation-driven reasoning and reliance solely on images. We propose a novel neuro_symbolic framework that integrates both panoramic-image and 3D point cloud information, combining neural perception with symbolic reasoning to explicitly model spatial and logical relationships. Our framework consists of a perception module for detecting entities and extracting attributes, and a reasoning module that constructs a structured scene graph to support precise, interpretable queries. Evaluated on the JRDB-Reasoning dataset, our approach demonstrates superior performance and reliability in crowded, human_built environments while maintaining a lightweight design suitable for robotics and embodied AI applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[PoseDiff: A Unified Diffusion Model Bridging Robot Pose Estimation and Video-to-Action Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24591v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present PoseDiff, a conditional diffusion model that unifies robot state estimation and control within a single framework. At its core, PoseDiff maps raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy. This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between perception, planning, and control in embodied AI. The video visualization results can be found on the project page: https://haozhuo-zhang.github.io/PoseDiff-project-page/.</p></details> | <details><summary>The e...</summary><p>The experimental setup and metrics lacks rigor, affecting the fairness of the comparisons</p></details> |
| **[SynHLMA:Synthesizing Hand Language Manipulation for Articulated Object with Discrete Human Object Interaction Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25268v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating hand grasps with language instructions is a widely studied topic that benefits from embodied AI and VR/AR applications. While transferring into hand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires not only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along the object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation framework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated objects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a discrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along with the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an HAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its language description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is employed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated object joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand manipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction and HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and experimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation performance comparing with state-of-the-art. We also show a robotics grasp application that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning using the manipulation sequence provided by our SynHLMA. Our codes and datasets will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[SceneWeaver: All-in-One 3D Scene Synthesis with an Extensible and Self-Reflective Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20414v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose 3D environment generation.

| **[Two-Steps Diffusion Policy for Robotic Manipulation via Genetic Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21991v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, such as diffusion policy, have achieved state-of-the-art results in robotic manipulation by imitating expert demonstrations. While diffusion models were originally developed for vision tasks like image and video generation, many of their inference strategies have been directly transferred to control domains without adaptation. In this work, we show that by tailoring the denoising process to the specific characteristics of embodied AI tasks -- particularly structured, low-dimensional nature of action distributions -- diffusion policies can operate effectively with as few as 5 neural function evaluations (NFE). Building on this insight, we propose a population-based sampling strategy, genetic denoising, which enhances both performance and stability by selecting denoising trajectories with low out-of-distribution risk. Our method solves challenging tasks with only 2 NFE while improving or matching performance. We evaluate our approach across 14 robotic manipulation tasks from D4RL and Robomimic, spanning multiple action horizons and inference budgets. In over 2 million evaluations, our method consistently outperforms standard diffusion-based policies, achieving up to 20\% performance gains with significantly fewer inference steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figure, 2 tables, accepted at Neurips 2025</p></details> |
| **[MEReQ: Max-Ent Residual-Q Inverse RL for Sample-Efficient Alignment from Intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16258v4)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning robot behavior with human preferences is crucial for deploying embodied AI agents in human-centered environments. A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[EmbodiedBrain: Expanding Performance Boundaries of Task Planning for Embodied Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20578v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model (GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency. For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks, highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data, model weight, and evaluating methods, which are available at https://zterobot.github.io/EmbodiedBrain.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Direct Numerical Layout Generation for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05341v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset. Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://directlayout.github.io/</p></details> |

World simulators provide such environments but face distinct limitations: video-based methods generate diverse content but lack real-time physics feedback for interactive learning, while physics-based engines provide accurate dynamics but face scalability limitations from costly manual asset creation. We present Seed3D 1.0, a foundation model that generates simulation-ready 3D assets from single images, addressing the scalability challenge while maintaining physics rigor. Unlike existing 3D generation models, our system produces assets with accurate geometry, well-aligned textures, and realistic physically-based materials. These assets can be directly integrated into physics engines with minimal configuration, enabling deployment in robotic manipulation and simulation training. Beyond individual objects, the system scales to complete scene generation through assembling objects into coherent environments. By enabling scalable simulation-ready content creation, Seed3D 1.0 provides a foundation for advancing physics-based world simulators.

They also serve as the foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project and benchmark are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/MV-RoboBench</p></details> |
| **[Seeing through Uncertainty: Robust Task-Oriented Optimization in Visual Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00441v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual navigation is a fundamental problem in embodied AI, yet practical deployments demand long-horizon planning capabilities to address multi-objective tasks. A major bottleneck is data scarcity: policies learned from limited data often overfit and fail to generalize OOD. Existing neural network-based agents typically increase architectural complexity that paradoxically become counterproductive in the small-sample regime. This paper introduce NeuRO, a integrated learning-to-optimize framework that tightly couples perception networks with downstream task-level robust optimization. Specifically, NeuRO addresses core difficulties in this integration: (i) it transforms noisy visual predictions under data scarcity into convex uncertainty sets using Partially Input Convex Neural Networks (PICNNs) with conformal calibration, which directly parameterize the optimization constraints; and (ii) it reformulates planning under partial observability as a robust optimization problem, enabling uncertainty-aware policies that transfer across environments. Extensive experiments on both unordered and sequential multi-object navigation tasks demonstrate that NeuRO establishes SoTA performance, particularly in generalization to unseen environments. Our work thus presents a significant advancement for developing robust, generalizable autonomous agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIKI-R: Coordinating Embodied Multi-Agent Cooperation via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09049v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://faceong.github.io/VIKI-R/</p></details> |
| **[3D Audio-Visual Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02236v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing the sounding objects in scenes is a longstanding objective in embodied AI, with diverse applications in robotics and AR/VR/MR. To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

| **[Bridging Embodiment Gaps: Deploying Vision-Language-Action Models on Soft Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17369v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic systems are increasingly expected to operate in human-centered, unstructured environments where safety, adaptability, and generalization are essential. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have been proposed as a language guided generalized control framework for real robots. However, their deployment has been limited to conventional serial link manipulators. Coupled by their rigidity and unpredictability of learning based control, the ability to safely interact with the environment is missing yet critical. In this work, we present the deployment of a VLA model on a soft continuum manipulator to demonstrate autonomous safe human-robot interaction. We present a structured finetuning and deployment pipeline evaluating two state-of-the-art VLA models (OpenVLA-OFT and $\pi_0$) across representative manipulation tasks, and show while out-of-the-box policies fail due to embodiment mismatch, through targeted finetuning the soft robot performs equally to the rigid counterpart. Our findings highlight the necessity of finetuning for bridging embodiment gaps, and demonstrate that coupling VLA models with soft robots enables safe and flexible embodied AI in human-shared environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 SpaVLE workshop. 4 pages, 2 figures(in main paper, excluding references and supplements)</p></details> |

Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has led to a growing demand for AI-enabled wireless networks. The open-source DeepSeek models are famous for their innovative designs, such as large-scale pure RL and cost-efficient training, which make them well-suited for practical deployment in wireless networks. By integrating DeepSeek-style LLMs with wireless infrastructures, a synergistic opportunity arises: the DeepSeek-style LLMs enhance network optimization with strong reasoning and decision-making abilities, while wireless infrastructure enables the broad deployment of these models. Motivated by this convergence, this survey presents a comprehensive DeepSeek-inspired exploration of RL-based LLMs in the context of wireless networks. We begin by reviewing key techniques behind network optimization to establish a foundation for understanding DeepSeek-style LLM integration. Next, we examine recent advancements in RL-based LLMs, using DeepSeek models as a representative example. Building on this, we explore the synergy between the two domains, highlighting motivations, challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we highlight emerging directions for integrating LLMs with wireless networks, such as quantum, on-device, and neural-symbolic LLM models, as well as embodied AI agents. Overall, this survey offers a comprehensive examination of the interplay between DeepSeek-style LLMs and wireless networks, demonstrating how these domains can mutually enhance each other to drive innovation.</p></details> | 45 pages, 12 figures |

World models serve as internal simulators that capture environment dynamics, enabling forward and counterfactual rollouts to support perception, prediction, and decision making. This survey presents a unified framework for world models in embodied AI. Specifically, we formalize the problem setting and learning objectives, and propose a three-axis taxonomy encompassing: (1) Functionality, Decision-Coupled vs. General-Purpose; (2) Temporal Modeling, Sequential Simulation and Inference vs. Global Difference Prediction; (3) Spatial Representation, Global Latent Vector, Token Feature Sequence, Spatial Latent Grid, and Decomposed Rendering Representation. We systematize data resources and metrics across robotics, autonomous driving, and general video settings, covering pixel prediction quality, state-level understanding, and task performance. Furthermore, we offer a quantitative comparison of state-of-the-art models and distill key open challenges, including the scarcity of unified datasets and the need for evaluation metrics that assess physical consistency over pixel fidelity, the trade-off between model performance and the computational efficiency required for real-time control, and the core modeling difficulty of achieving long-horizon temporal consistency while mitigating error accumulation.

| **[Elevating Visual Perception in Multimodal LLMs with Visual Embedding Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09585v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, the standard practice for developing MLLMs is to feed features from vision encoder(s) into the LLM and train with natural language supervision. This approach often causes models to lean towards language comprehension and undermine the rich visual perception signals present in the data, which are critical for tasks involving spatial reasoning in the domain of embodied AI and robotics. Is it possible to optimize both at the same time? In this work, we propose VisPer-LM, the first approach that infuses visual perception knowledge from expert vision encoders into the LLM's (of an MLLM) hidden representations. We start by investigating MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Given this insight, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next (text) token prediction. Moreover, through extensive probing, we observe improved visual representation quality due to embedding optimization, underscoring the effectiveness of our probing setup. We demonstrate that our VisPer-LM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. In particular, VisPer-LM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/visper_lm/</p></details> |

Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware, interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats, which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused, local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, Project Page: https://cl-splats.github.io</p></details> |

Featuring 735 sequences (7,875 seconds at 30 fps), HUMOTO captures interactions with 63 precisely modeled objects and 72 articulated parts. Our innovations include a scene-driven LLM scripting pipeline creating complete, purposeful tasks with natural progression, and a mocap-and-camera recording setup to effectively handle occlusions. Spanning diverse activities from cooking to outdoor picnics, HUMOTO preserves both physical accuracy and logical task flow. Professional artists rigorously clean and verify each sequence, minimizing foot sliding and object penetrations. We also provide benchmarks compared to other datasets.

This paper proposes a novel framework, named SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</p></details> |
| **[ERA: Transforming VLMs into Embodied Agents via Embodied Prior Learning and Online Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12693v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present \textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2) Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of 8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for future embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image Quality Assessment for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16815v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI has developed rapidly in recent years, but it is still mainly deployed in laboratories, with various distortions in the Real-world limiting its application. Traditionally, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods are applied to predict human preferences for distorted images; however, there is no IQA method to assess the usability of an image in embodied tasks, namely, the perceptual quality for robots. To provide accurate and reliable quality indicators for future embodied scenarios, we first propose the topic: IQA for Embodied AI. Specifically, we (1) based on the Mertonian system and meta-cognitive theory, constructed a perception-cognition-decision-execution pipeline and defined a comprehensive subjective score collection process; (2) established the Embodied-IQA database, containing over 36k reference/distorted image pairs, with more than 5m fine-grained annotations provided by Vision Language Models/Vision Language Action-models/Real-world robots; (3) trained and validated the performance of mainstream IQA methods on Embodied-IQA, demonstrating the need to develop more accurate quality indicators for Embodied AI. We sincerely hope that through evaluation, we can promote the application of Embodied AI under complex distortions in the Real-world.

| **[InternScenes: A Large-scale Simulatable Indoor Scene Dataset with Realistic Layouts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10813v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of Embodied AI heavily relies on large-scale, simulatable 3D scene datasets characterized by scene diversity and realistic layouts. However, existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity, sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond 'Templates': Category-Agnostic Object Pose, Size, and Shape Estimation from a Single View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11687v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL, spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D understanding in robotics and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization. Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment. Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy. For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex, providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables, NeurIPS 2025 Camera Ready Version (oral)</p></details> |

However, without a mechanism to evaluate the quality of demonstrated actions, they are limited to learning from optimal behaviour, or they risk replicating errors and inefficiencies. While reinforcement learning offers one alternative, the associated exploration typically results in sacrificing data efficiency. This work explores how agents trained with imitation learning can learn robust representations from both optimal and suboptimal demonstrations when given access to constructive language feedback as a means to contextualise different modes of behaviour. We directly provide language feedback embeddings as part of the input sequence into a Transformer-based policy, and optionally complement the traditional next action prediction objective with auxiliary self-supervised learning objectives for feedback prediction. We test our approach on a range of embodied Vision-and-Language tasks in our custom BabyAI-XGen environment and show significant improvements in agents' compositional generalisation abilities and robustness, suggesting that our data-efficient method allows models to successfully convert suboptimal behaviour into learning opportunities. Overall, our results suggest that language feedback is a competitive and intuitive alternative to intermediate scalar rewards for language-specified embodied tasks.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

Although recent advances in simulation platforms have greatly enhanced task diversity to train embodied Vision Language Models (VLMs), most platforms rely on simplified robot morphologies and bypass the stochastic nature of low-level execution, which limits their transferability to real-world robots. To address these issues, we present a physics-based simulation platform DualTHOR for complex dual-arm humanoid robots, built upon an extended version of AI2-THOR. Our simulator includes real-world robot assets, a task suite for dual-arm collaboration, and inverse kinematics solvers for humanoid robots. We also introduce a contingency mechanism that incorporates potential failures through physics-based low-level execution, bridging the gap to real-world scenarios. Our simulator enables a more comprehensive evaluation of the robustness and generalization of VLMs in household environments. Extensive evaluations reveal that current VLMs struggle with dual-arm coordination and exhibit limited robustness in realistic environments with contingencies, highlighting the importance of using our simulator to develop more capable VLMs for embodied tasks.

We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.</p></details> | 6 pages |

A backdoored VLA agent can be covertly triggered by a pre-injected backdoor to execute adversarial actions, potentially causing system failures or even physical harm. Although backdoor attacks on VLA models have been explored, prior work has focused only on untargeted attacks, leaving the more practically threatening scenario of targeted manipulation unexamined. In this paper, we study targeted backdoor attacks on VLA models and introduce TabVLA, a novel framework that enables such attacks via black-box fine-tuning. TabVLA explores two deployment-relevant inference-time threat models: input-stream editing and in-scene triggering. It formulates poisoned data generation as an optimization problem to improve attack effectivess. Experiments with OpenVLA-7B on the LIBERO benchmark reveal that the vision channel is the principal attack surface: targeted backdoors succeed with minimal poisoning, remain robust across variations in trigger design, and are degraded only by positional mismatches between fine-tuning and inference triggers. We also investigate a potential detection-based defense against TabVLA, which reconstructs latent visual triggers from the input stream to flag activation-conditioned backdoor samples. Our work highlights the vulnerability of VLA models to targeted backdoor manipulation and underscores the need for more advanced defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 tables, 1 figure.

In a grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop, plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search, belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is required.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Unlike previous surveys that often focus on specific modalities or limited fusion strategies, our work presents a structure-centric and method-driven framework that emphasizes generalizable techniques. We systematically categorize and analyze key approaches to alignment and fusion through both structural perspectives -- data-level, feature-level, and output-level fusion -- and methodological paradigms -- including statistical, kernel-based, graphical, generative, contrastive, attention-based, and large language model (LLM)-based methods, drawing insights from an extensive review of over 260 relevant studies. Furthermore, this survey highlights critical challenges such as cross-modal misalignment, computational bottlenecks, data quality issues, and the modality gap, along with recent efforts to address them. Applications ranging from social media analysis and medical imaging to emotion recognition and embodied AI are explored to illustrate the real-world impact of robust multimodal systems.

For any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs. It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source, specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

These aspects are critical for embodied AI, where agents must act under uncertainty and delayed perception. We introduce FOGMACHINE , an open-source framework that fuses DSGs with discrete-event simulation to model object dynamics, agent observations, and interactions at scale.

| **[Goal-oriented Backdoor Attack against Vision-Language-Action Models via Physical Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09269v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have greatly improved embodied AI, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions and perform diverse tasks. However, their reliance on uncurated training datasets raises serious security concerns. Existing backdoor attacks on VLAs mostly assume white-box access and result in task failures instead of enforcing specific actions. In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers can manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the training dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the VLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes predefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers. Specifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO that incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions. In addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim VLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and success to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to successfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the physical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on clean inputs. Finally, by investigating factors related to GoBA, we find that the action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack performance, while trigger size has surprisingly little effect. The code and BadLIBERO dataset are accessible via the project page at https://goba-attack.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTR-Bench: Evaluating Geo-Temporal Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07791v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

While recent studies leverage visual or textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain. Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise, prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D affordance segmentation.</p></details> | Work in process |

While current learning tools show promise for speaking practice, most focus on dyadic, scripted scenarios, limiting opportunities for dynamic group interactions. To address this gap, we present ConversAR, a Mixed Reality system that leverages Generative AI and XR to support situated and personalized group conversations. It integrates embodied AI agents, scene recognition, and generative 3D props anchored to real-world surroundings. Based on a formative study with experts in language acquisition, we developed and tested this system with a user study with 21 second-language learners. Results indicate that the system enhanced learner engagement, increased willingness to communicate, and offered a safe space for speaking. We discuss the implications for integrating Generative AI and XR into the design of future language learning applications.</p></details> | 22 pages |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in semantic reasoning and task planning, a significant gap persists between their high-level understanding and the precise physical execution required for real-world manipulation. To bridge this "semantic-to-physical" gap, we introduce GRACE, a novel framework that grounds VLM-based reasoning through executable analytic concepts (EAC)-mathematically defined blueprints that encode object affordances, geometric constraints, and semantics of manipulation. Our approach integrates a structured policy scaffolding pipeline that turn natural language instructions and visual information into an instantiated EAC, from which we derive grasp poses, force directions and plan physically feasible motion trajectory for robot execution. GRACE thus provides a unified and interpretable interface between high-level instruction understanding and low-level robot control, effectively enabling precise and generalizable manipulation through semantic-physical grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRACE achieves strong zero-shot generalization across a variety of articulated objects in both simulated and real-world environments, without requiring task-specific training.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, submitted for ICLR 2026 conference</p></details> |

However, their robustness to natural language variability in real-world scenarios has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present a novel systematic study of the robustness of state-of-the-art VLA models under linguistic perturbations. Specifically, we evaluate model performance under two types of instruction noise: (1) human-generated paraphrasing and (2) the addition of irrelevant context. We further categorize irrelevant contexts into two groups according to their length and their semantic and lexical proximity to robot commands. In this study, we observe consistent performance degradation as context size expands. We also demonstrate that the model can exhibit relative robustness to random context, with a performance drop within 10%, while semantically and lexically similar context of the same length can trigger a quality decline of around 50%. Human paraphrases of instructions lead to a drop of nearly 20%. To mitigate this, we propose an LLM-based filtering framework that extracts core commands from noisy inputs. Incorporating our filtering step allows models to recover up to 98.5% of their original performance under noisy conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Safety Challenge of World Models for Embodied AI Agents: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05865v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret, and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a quantitative evaluation of the results.</p></details> |  |

Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative: they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction, enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation. Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at https://worv-ai.github.io/d2e/</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Brain: A Neuroscience-inspired Framework for Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07634v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has shifted from static, data-driven models to dynamic systems capable of perceiving and interacting with real-world environments. Despite advancements in pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning, current AI systems, such as large language models, remain disembodied, unable to physically engage with the world. This limitation has driven the rise of embodied AI, where autonomous agents, such as humanoid robots, must navigate and manipulate unstructured environments with human-like adaptability. At the core of this challenge lies the concept of Neural Brain, a central intelligence system designed to drive embodied agents with human-like adaptability. A Neural Brain must seamlessly integrate multimodal sensing and perception with cognitive capabilities. Achieving this also requires an adaptive memory system and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design, enabling real-time action in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a unified framework for the Neural Brain of embodied agents, addressing two fundamental challenges: (1) defining the core components of Neural Brain and (2) bridging the gap between static AI models and the dynamic adaptability required for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose a biologically inspired architecture that integrates multimodal active sensing, perception-cognition-action function, neuroplasticity-based memory storage and updating, and neuromorphic hardware/software optimization. Furthermore, we also review the latest research on embodied agents across these four aspects and analyze the gap between current AI systems and human intelligence. By synthesizing insights from neuroscience, we outline a roadmap towards the development of generalizable, autonomous agents capable of human-level intelligence in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 17 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

These models have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark, VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation. Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware, potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.</p></details> | We are revising it |

Despite the rapid progress of video diffusion models (VDMs), their use for general-purpose human video generation remains underexplored, with most works constrained to image-to-video setups or narrow domains like dance videos. In this work, we propose CAMEO, a cascaded framework for general human motion video generation. It seamlessly bridges Text-to-Motion (T2M) models and conditional VDMs, mitigating suboptimal factors that may arise in this process across both training and inference through carefully designed components. Specifically, we analyze and prepare both textual prompts and visual conditions to effectively train the VDM, ensuring robust alignment between motion descriptions, conditioning signals, and the generated videos. Furthermore, we introduce a camera-aware conditioning module that connects the two stages, automatically selecting viewpoints aligned with the input text to enhance coherence and reduce manual intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both the MovieGen benchmark and a newly introduced benchmark tailored to the T2M-VDM combination, while highlighting its versatility across diverse use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, Project Page:https://hyelinnam.github.io/Cameo/</p></details> |

This paper explores different prompting methods and evaluates their effectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making. We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied Agents that leverage LLMs for multi-agent communication, reasoning, and task coordination in shared virtual spaces.

Furthermore, we extend our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the system running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system.

However, current VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations. Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy. Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1.

To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions.

These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a new class of prompt-based attacks that exploit the multimodal language interpretation abilities of Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs). CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents; drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, and aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete. Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models, provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand, advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility, dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers.

An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

However, existing interactive segmentation methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained, multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new 3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale, scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines, PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, conference</p></details> |

We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://zju-real.github.io/ViewSpatial-Page/</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Embodied Planning with Verifiable Reward for Real-World Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25852v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling robots to execute long-horizon manipulation tasks from free-form language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as high-level planners, their deployment in the real world is hindered by two gaps: (i) the scarcity of large-scale, sequential manipulation data that couples natural language with multi-step action plans, and (ii) the absence of dense, interpretable rewards for fine-tuning VLMs on planning objectives. To address these issues, we propose REVER, a framework that empowers VLMs to generate and validate long-horizon manipulation plans from natural language instructions in real-world scenarios. Under REVER we train and release RoboFarseer, a VLM incentivized to emit chain-of-thought that perform temporal and spatial reasoning, ensuring physically plausible and logically coherent plans. To obtain training data, we leverage the Universal Manipulation Interface framework to capture hardware-agnostic demonstrations of atomic skills. An automated annotation engine converts each demonstration into vision-instruction-plan triplet. We introduce a verifiable reward that scores the generated plan by its ordered bipartite matching overlap with the ground-truth skill sequence. At run time, the fine-tuned VLM functions both as a planner and as a monitor, verifying step-wise completion. RoboFarseer matches or exceeds the performance of proprietary models that are orders of magnitude larger, while on open-ended planning it surpasses the best baseline by more than 40%. In real-world, long-horizon tasks, the complete system boosts overall success by roughly 60% compared with the same low-level controller without the planner.

Prior work has addressed this issue by creating spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data. Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-and-Language Navigation with Analogical Textual Descriptions in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25139v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions. We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in navigation performance.</p></details> |  |

Yet prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge; and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders, suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability. Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time, and 32.8% lower memory usage, while improving navigation performance across four public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a poster in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Intentional Gesture: Deliver Your Intentions with Gestures for Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15197v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When humans speak, gestures help convey communicative intentions, such as adding emphasis or describing concepts. However, current co-speech gesture generation methods rely solely on superficial linguistic cues (e.g. speech audio or text transcripts), neglecting to understand and leverage the communicative intention that underpins human gestures. This results in outputs that are rhythmically synchronized with speech but are semantically shallow. To address this gap, we introduce Intentional-Gesture, a novel framework that casts gesture generation as an intention-reasoning task grounded in high-level communicative functions. First, we curate the InG dataset by augmenting BEAT-2 with gesture-intention annotations (i.e., text sentences summarizing intentions), which are automatically annotated using large vision-language models. Next, we introduce the Intentional Gesture Motion Tokenizer to leverage these intention annotations. It injects high-level communicative functions (e.g., intentions) into tokenized motion representations to enable intention-aware gesture synthesis that are both temporally aligned and semantically meaningful, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on the BEAT-2 benchmark. Our framework offers a modular foundation for expressive gesture generation in digital humans and embodied AI. Project Page: https://andypinxinliu.github.io/Intentional-Gesture</p></details> |  |
| **[Can AI Perceive Physical Danger and Intervene?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21651v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent -- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions. The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at https://asimov-benchmark.github.io/v2</p></details> |  |

Interactable digital twins of such objects have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. Unfortunately, current methods to digitize articulated real-world objects require carefully captured data, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable acquisition. We focus on motion analysis and part-level segmentation of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to obtain at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is challenging due to simultaneous object and camera motion and significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce iTACO: a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories that is 20$\times$ larger than available in prior work. We then compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Our experiments show that iTACO outperforms existing articulated object digital twin methods on both synthetic and real casually captured RGBD videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website can be found at https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/video2articulation/</p></details> |
| **[Embodied AI: From LLMs to World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20021v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system paradigm for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for various applications and driving the evolution from cyberspace to physical systems. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models (WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building internal representations and future predictions of the external world, facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances, covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e., embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs, meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Last but not least, we point out future research directions of embodied AI that deserve further investigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE CASM</p></details> |

However, deploying such agents in realistic human-centered scenarios, such as domestic households, remains challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of modeling individual human preferences and behaviors. In this work, we introduce PersONAL (PERSonalized Object Navigation And Localization, a comprehensive benchmark designed to study personalization in Embodied AI. Agents must identify, retrieve, and navigate to objects associated with specific users, responding to natural-language queries such as "find Lily's backpack". PersONAL comprises over 2,000 high-quality episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from the HM3D dataset. Each episode includes a natural-language scene description with explicit associations between objects and their owners, requiring agents to reason over user-specific semantics. The benchmark supports two evaluation modes: (1) active navigation in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in previously mapped scenes. Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines reveal a substantial gap to human performance, highlighting the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and memorizing over personalized information; paving the way towards real-world assistive robot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plan Verification for LLM-Based Embodied Task Completion Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02761v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions, redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches, our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout). The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

To address these obstacles, we present Embodied Arena, a comprehensive, unified, and evolving evaluation platform for Embodied AI. Our platform establishes a systematic embodied capability taxonomy spanning three levels (perception, reasoning, task execution), seven core capabilities, and 25 fine-grained dimensions, enabling unified evaluation with systematic research objectives. We introduce a standardized evaluation system built upon unified infrastructure supporting flexible integration of 22 diverse benchmarks across three domains (2D/3D Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) and 30+ advanced models from 20+ worldwide institutes. Additionally, we develop a novel LLM-driven automated generation pipeline ensuring scalable embodied evaluation data with continuous evolution for diversity and comprehensiveness. Embodied Arena publishes three real-time leaderboards (Embodied Q&A, Navigation, Task Planning) with dual perspectives (benchmark view and capability view), providing comprehensive overviews of advanced model capabilities. Especially, we present nine findings summarized from the evaluation results on the leaderboards of Embodied Arena. This helps to establish clear research veins and pinpoint critical research problems, thereby driving forward progress in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, Embodied Arena Technical Report</p></details> |

Yet current video benchmarks focus largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.</p></details> |  |

As a result, sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge. In this paper, we introduce EmbodiedSplat, a novel approach that personalizes policy training by efficiently capturing the deployment environment and fine-tuning policies within the reconstructed scenes. Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and the Habitat-Sim simulator to bridge the gap between realistic scene capture and effective training environments. Using iPhone-captured deployment scenes, we reconstruct meshes via GS, enabling training in settings that closely approximate real-world conditions. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, pre-training datasets, and mesh reconstruction techniques, evaluating their impact on sim-to-real predictivity in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that agents fine-tuned with EmbodiedSplat outperform both zero-shot baselines pre-trained on large-scale real-world datasets (HM3D) and synthetically generated datasets (HSSD), achieving absolute success rate improvements of 20% and 40% on real-world Image Navigation task. Moreover, our approach yields a high sim-vs-real correlation (0.87-0.97) for the reconstructed meshes, underscoring its effectiveness in adapting policies to diverse environments with minimal effort.

| **[Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16176v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Agentic Aerial Cinematography: From Dialogue Cues to Cinematic Trajectories (ACDC), an autonomous drone cinematography system driven by natural language communication between human directors and drones. The main limitation of previous drone cinematography workflows is that they require manual selection of waypoints and view angles based on predefined human intent, which is labor-intensive and yields inconsistent performance. In this paper, we propose employing large language models (LLMs) and vision foundation models (VFMs) to convert free-form natural language prompts directly into executable indoor UAV video tours. Specifically, our method comprises a vision-language retrieval pipeline for initial waypoint selection, a preference-based Bayesian optimization framework that refines poses using aesthetic feedback, and a motion planner that generates safe quadrotor trajectories. We validate ACDC through both simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating that it robustly produces professional-quality footage across diverse indoor scenes without requiring expertise in robotics or cinematography. These results highlight the potential of embodied AI agents to close the loop from open-vocabulary dialogue to real-world autonomous aerial cinematography.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, prevailing machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations, and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning, enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17 benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition, fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient, flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition.

Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

To overcome these obstacles, we propose RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks. Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pku-epic.github.io/NavFoM-Web/</p></details> |

For example, such knowledge directs an agent to grasp a knife by the handle for cutting or by the blade for safe handover. While existing approaches have made notable progress, affordance research still faces three key challenges: data scarcity, poor generalization, and real-world deployment. Specifically, there is a lack of large-scale affordance datasets with precise segmentation maps, existing models struggle to generalize across different domains or novel object and affordance classes, and little work demonstrates deployability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address these issues by proposing a complete affordance learning system that (1) takes in egocentric videos and outputs precise affordance annotations without human labeling, (2) leverages geometric information and vision foundation models to improve generalization, and (3) introduces a framework that facilitates affordance-oriented robotic manipulation such as tool grasping and robot-to-human tool handover. Experimental results show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art by 13.8% in mIoU, and the framework achieves 77.1% successful grasping among 179 trials, including evaluations on seen, unseen classes, and cluttered scenes.

While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world, incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g., CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for complex, real-world environments.

It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models.

| **[Nav-R1: Reasoning and Navigation in Embodied Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10884v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied navigation requires agents to integrate perception, reasoning, and action for robust interaction in complex 3D environments. Existing approaches often suffer from incoherent and unstable reasoning traces that hinder generalization across diverse environments, and difficulty balancing long-horizon semantic reasoning with low-latency control for real-time navigation. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-R1, an embodied foundation model that unifies reasoning in embodied environments. We first construct Nav-CoT-110K, a large-scale dataset of step-by-step Chains-of-Thought (CoT) for embodied tasks, which enables cold-start initialization with structured reasoning. Building on this foundation, we design a GRPO-based reinforcement learning framework with three complementary rewards: format, understanding, and navigation, to improve structural adherence, semantic grounding, and path fidelity. Furthermore, we introduce a Fast-in-Slow reasoning paradigm, decoupling deliberate semantic reasoning from low-latency reactive control for efficient yet coherent navigation. Extensive evaluations on embodied AI benchmarks demonstrate that Nav-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, with over 8% average improvement in reasoning and navigation performance. Real-world deployment on a mobile robot further validates its robustness under limited onboard resources. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/Nav-R1.

| **[LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528v6)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p></details> | CoRL 2025 |

Traditional sequential computation patterns, while effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by 2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and providing high throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attribution Regularization for Multimodal Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02359v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal machine learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for integrating information from multiple modalities to enhance learning and decision-making processes. However, it is commonly observed that unimodal models outperform multimodal models, despite the latter having access to richer information. Additionally, the influence of a single modality often dominates the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions. The focus of this project lies in the video-audio domain, although the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved. By leveraging this regularization term, the proposed approach aims to mitigate the issue of unimodal dominance and improve the performance of multimodal machine learning systems. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed technique will be assessed. The findings of this research project have the potential to significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal machine learning and facilitate its application in various domains, including multimedia analysis, human-computer interaction, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |

This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce ViCA (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant)-322K, a diverse dataset of 322,003 QA pairs from real-world indoor videos (ARKitScenes, ScanNet, ScanNet++), offering supervision for 3D metadata-grounded queries and video-based complex reasoning. Second, we develop ViCA-7B, fine-tuned on ViCA-322K, which achieves new state-of-the-art on all eight VSI-Bench tasks, outperforming existing models, including larger ones (e.g., +26.1 on Absolute Distance). For interpretability, we present ViCA-Thinking-2.68K, a dataset with explicit reasoning chains, and fine-tune ViCA-7B to create ViCA-7B-Thinking, a model that articulates its spatial reasoning. Our work highlights the importance of targeted data and suggests paths for improved temporal-spatial modeling.

Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception, foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation, and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1 consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in both task success rate and generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://aopolin-lv.github.io/F1-VLA/</p></details> |
| **[LatticeWorld: A Multimodal Large Language Model-Empowered Framework for Interactive Complex World Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05263v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents, featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a $90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

| **[Generative World Explorer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11844v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |

These challenges expose a pressing need for machine learning models capable of swift, context-aware adaptation while balancing model generalization and personalization. Here, two methods emerge as suitable candidates, each offering parts of these capabilities: multi-modal multi-task foundation models (M3T-FMs) provide a pathway toward generalization across tasks and modalities, whereas federated learning (FL) offers the infrastructure for distributed, privacy-preserving model updates and user-level model personalization. However, when used in isolation, each of these approaches falls short of meeting the complex and diverse capability requirements of real-world embodied AI environments. In this vision paper, we introduce multi-modal multi-task federated foundation models (M3T-FFMs) for embodied AI, a new paradigm that unifies the strengths of M3T-FMs with the privacy-preserving distributed training nature of FL, enabling intelligent systems at the wireless edge. We collect critical deployment dimensions of M3T-FFMs in embodied AI ecosystems under a unified framework, which we name "EMBODY": Embodiment heterogeneity, Modality richness and imbalance, Bandwidth and compute constraints, On-device continual learning, Distributed control and autonomy, and Yielding safety, privacy, and personalization. For each, we identify concrete challenges and envision actionable research directions. We also present an evaluation framework for deploying M3T-FFMs in embodied AI systems, along with the associated trade-offs. Finally, we present a prototype implementation of M3T-FFMs and evaluate their energy and latency performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication in IEEE Internet of Things Magazine, 2025</p></details> |

However, most recent reinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress external forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically restricted to base or end-effector control and focus on resisting extreme forces rather than enabling compliance. We introduce GentleHumanoid, a framework that integrates impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking policy to achieve upper-body compliance. At its core is a unified spring-based formulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing against surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human motion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse interaction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable force thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the Unitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance, including gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object manipulation. Compared to baselines, our policy consistently reduces peak contact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more natural interactions. These results highlight a step toward humanoid robots that can safely and effectively collaborate with humans and handle objects in real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Home ...</summary><p>Home page: https://gentle-humanoid.axell.top</p></details> |
| **[Forgetting is Everywhere](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04666v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental challenge in developing general learning algorithms is their tendency to forget past knowledge when adapting to new data. Addressing this problem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades of study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the underlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic theory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a learner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a loss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure of an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a comprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression, generative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate how forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant role in determining learning efficiency. Together, these results establish a principled understanding of forgetting and lay the foundation for analysing and improving the information retention capabilities of general learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ben-sanati.github.io/forgetting-is-everywhere-project/</p></details> |

We show that an agent can learn to solve tasks by selecting its own goals in an environment-agnostic way, at training times comparable to externally guided reinforcement learning. Our method is independent of the underlying off-policy learning algorithm. Since our method is environment-agnostic, the agent does not value any goals higher than others, leading to instability in performance for individual goals. However, in our experiments, we show that the average goal success rate improves and stabilizes. An agent trained with this method can be instructed to seek any observations made in the environment, enabling generic training of agents prior to specific use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages without cover, references and supplementary materials, 11 with.

So far, our method has exclusively been demonstrated on a small-scale case study. Herein, we show that our method scales well to a more challenging demand response case study built on a large-scale model of a single-product (nitrogen) air separation unit. Across all numerical experiments, we assume observability of only a few realistically measurable plant variables. Compared to a purely system identification-based Koopman eNMPC, which generates small economic savings but frequently violates constraints, our method delivers similar economic performance while avoiding constraint violations.</p></details> | <details><summary>manus...</summary><p>manuscript (8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table), supplementary materials (5 pages, 1 figure, 1 table)</p></details> |

Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs. To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1) a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing image-interactive reasoning applications.</p></details> | Working in progress |

These models have received much attention in recent years for characterizing human and animal decision making behavior. We provide a generic mathematical optimization problem formulation for the fitting problem of a wide range of RL models that appear frequently in scientific research applications, followed by a detailed theoretical analysis of its convexity properties. Based on the theoretical results, we introduce a novel solution method for the fitting problem of RL models based on convex relaxation and optimization. Our method is then evaluated in several simulated bandit environments to compare with some benchmark methods that appear in the literature. Numerical results indicate that our method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, while significantly reducing computation time. We also provide an open-source Python package for our proposed method to empower researchers to apply it in the analysis of their datasets directly, without prior knowledge of convex optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Communication Skills in Multi-task Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03348v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), agents can communicate with one another to perform a task in a coordinated manner. When multiple tasks are involved, agents can also leverage knowledge from one task to improve learning in other tasks. In this paper, we propose Multi-task Communication Skills (MCS), a MADRL with communication method that learns and performs multiple tasks simultaneously, with agents interacting through learnable communication protocols. MCS employs a Transformer encoder to encode task-specific observations into a shared message space, capturing shared communication skills among agents. To enhance coordination among agents, we introduce a prediction network that correlates messages with the actions of sender agents in each task. We adapt three multi-agent benchmark environments to multi-task settings, where the number of agents as well as the observation and action spaces vary across tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MCS achieves better performance than multi-task MADRL baselines without communication, as well as single-task MADRL baselines with and without communication.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |
| **[The Peril of Preference: Why GRPO fails on Ordinal Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04439v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group-relative Policy Optimization's (GRPO) simplicity makes it highly desirable for adapting LLMs to become experts at specific tasks. But this simplicity also makes it ill-specified as we seek to enhance RL training with richer, non-binary feedback. When using ordinal rewards to give partial credit, GRPO's simplicity starts to hurt, as its group-average baseline often assigns a positive advantage to failed trajectories and reinforces incorrect behavior. We introduce Correctness Relative Policy Optimization (CoRPO), a new formulation that solves this flaw. CoRPO uses an adaptive baseline that enforces a minimum quality threshold, ensuring failed solutions are never positively reinforced. Once the policy consistently meets this threshold, the baseline automatically transitions to a relative preference mode, pushing the model to find optimal solutions rather than just "acceptable" ones. We empirically validate CoRPO on a code verification task, where it demonstrates more stable convergence and better out-of-domain generalization. This work represents a critical step in our broader research program to enable LLMs to learn genuinely new capabilities through reinforcement learning. We achieve this by enabling LLMs to learn from rich, multi-dimensional feedback - progressing from binary to ordinal rewards in this work, and onward to denser, per-step supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Action Selection for Action Chunking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04421v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action chunking is a widely adopted approach in Learning from Demonstration (LfD). By modeling multi-step action chunks rather than single-step actions, action chunking significantly enhances modeling capabilities for human expert policies. However, the reduced decision frequency restricts the utilization of recent observations, degrading reactivity - particularly evident in the inadequate adaptation to sensor noise and dynamic environmental changes. Existing efforts to address this issue have primarily resorted to trading off reactivity against decision consistency, without achieving both. To address this limitation, we propose a novel algorithm, Temporal Action Selector (TAS), which caches predicted action chunks from multiple timesteps and dynamically selects the optimal action through a lightweight selector network. TAS achieves balanced optimization across three critical dimensions: reactivity, decision consistency, and motion coherence. Experiments across multiple tasks with diverse base policies show that TAS significantly improves success rates - yielding an absolute gain of up to 73.3%. Furthermore, integrating TAS as a base policy with residual reinforcement learning (RL) substantially enhances training efficiency and elevates the performance plateau. Experiments in both simulation and physical robots confirm the method's efficacy.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches struggle to balance rich contextual representation with navigation efficiency. We present MacroNav, a learning-based navigation framework featuring two key components: (1) a lightweight context encoder trained via multi-task self-supervised learning to capture multi-scale, navigation-centric spatial representations; and (2) a reinforcement learning policy that seamlessly integrates these representations with graph-based reasoning for efficient action selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the context encoder's efficient and robust environmental understanding. Real-world deployments further validate MacroNav's effectiveness, yielding significant gains over state-of-the-art navigation methods in both Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), while maintaining low computational cost.

CUAs present unique challenges and is constrained by three persistent gaps: a scarcity of real-world CUA tasks, the lack of automated collection-and-annotation pipelines for multi-modal trajectories, and the absence of a unified benchmark that jointly evaluates GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction. GUI-360$^\circ$ addresses these gaps with an LLM-augmented, largely automated pipeline for query sourcing, environment-template construction, task instantiation, batched execution, and LLM-driven quality filtering. The released corpus contains over 1.2M executed action steps across thousands of trajectories in popular Windows office applications, and includes full-resolution screenshots, accessibility metadata when available, instantiated goals, intermediate reasoning traces, and both successful and failed action trajectories. The dataset supports three canonical tasks, GUI grounding, screen parsing, and action prediction, and a hybrid GUI+API action space that reflects modern agent designs. Benchmarking state-of-the-art vision--language models on GUI-360$^\circ$ reveals substantial out-of-the-box shortcomings in grounding and action prediction; supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning yield significant gains but do not close the gap to human-level reliability. We release GUI-360$^\circ$ and accompanying code to facilitate reproducible research and accelerate progress on robust desktop CUAs.

| **[Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback via Bayesian Preference Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04286v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from human preferences is a cornerstone of aligning machine learning models with subjective human judgments. Yet, collecting such preference data is often costly and time-consuming, motivating the need for more efficient learning paradigms. Two established approaches offer complementary advantages: RLHF scales effectively to high-dimensional tasks such as LLM fine-tuning, while PBO achieves greater sample efficiency through active querying. We propose a hybrid framework that unifies RLHF's scalability with PBO's query efficiency by integrating an acquisition-driven module into the RLHF pipeline, thereby enabling active and sample-efficient preference gathering. We validate the proposed approach on two representative domains: (i) high-dimensional preference optimization and (ii) LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in both sample efficiency and overall performance across these tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLoop: An Self-Improving Framework for Reinforcement Learning with Iterative Policy Initialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04285v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is powerful for training large reasoning models, its training dynamics harbor a critical challenge: RL overfitting, where models gain training rewards but lose generalization. Our analysis reveals this is driven by policy over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting of diverse solutions generated during training. Standard optimization discards this valuable inter-step policy diversity. To address this, we introduce RLoop, a self-improving framework built on iterative policy initialization. RLoop transforms the standard training process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the solution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to create an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting point for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via iterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations into robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting and substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and pass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSPO: Subsentence-level Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04256v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a significant part of post-training of the Large Language Models (LLMs), Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has greatly improved LLMs' reasoning skills. However, some RLVR algorithms, such as GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) and GSPO (Group Sequence Policy Optimization), are observed to suffer from unstable policy updates and low usage of sampling data, respectively. The importance ratio of GRPO is calculated at the token level, which focuses more on optimizing a single token. This will be easily affected by outliers, leading to model training collapse. GSPO proposed the calculation of the response level importance ratio, which solves the problem of high variance and training noise accumulation in the calculation of the GRPO importance ratio. However, since all the response tokens share a common importance ratio, extreme values can easily raise or lower the overall mean, leading to the entire response being mistakenly discarded, resulting in a decrease in the utilization of sampled data. This paper introduces SSPO, which applies sentence-level importance ratio, taking the balance between GRPO and GSPO. SSPO not only avoids training collapse and high variance, but also prevents the whole response tokens from being abandoned by the clipping mechanism. Furthermore, we apply sentence entropy to PPO-CLIP to steadily adjust the clipping bounds, encouraging high-entropy tokens to explore and narrow the clipping range of low-entropy tokens. In particular, SSPO achieves an average score of 46.57 across five datasets, surpassing GRPO (43.01) and GSPO (44.42), and wins state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. These results highlight SSPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data by taking the essence of GSPO but rejecting its shortcomings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Context Bridge the Reality Gap? Sim-to-Real Transfer of Context-Aware Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04249v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) for robotics, as policies trained in simulation often fail to generalize to the real world due to discrepancies in environment dynamics. Domain Randomization (DR) mitigates this issue by exposing the policy to a wide range of randomized dynamics during training, yet leading to a reduction in performance. While standard approaches typically train policies agnostic to these variations, we investigate whether sim-to-real transfer can be improved by conditioning the policy on an estimate of the dynamics parameters -- referred to as context. To this end, we integrate a context estimation module into a DR-based RL framework and systematically compare SOTA supervision strategies. We evaluate the resulting context-aware policies in both a canonical control benchmark and a real-world pushing task using a Franka Emika Panda robot. Results show that context-aware policies outperform the context-agnostic baseline across all settings, although the best supervision strategy depends on the task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Energy and Latency in 6G Smart Cities with Edge CyberTwins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00955v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of IoT devices in smart cities challenges 6G networks with conflicting energy-latency requirements across heterogeneous slices. Existing approaches struggle with the energy-latency trade-off, particularly for massive scale deployments exceeding 50,000 devices km. This paper proposes an edge-aware CyberTwin framework integrating hybrid federated learning for energy-latency co-optimization in 6G network slicing. Our approach combines centralized Artificial Intelligence scheduling for latency-sensitive slices with distributed federated learning for non-critical slices, enhanced by compressive sensing-based digital twins and renewable energy-aware resource allocation. The hybrid scheduler leverages a three-tier architecture with Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) based security attestation achieving 99.7% attack detection accuracy. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate 52% energy reduction for non-real-time slices compared to Diffusion-Reinforcement Learning baselines while maintaining 0.9ms latency for URLLC applications with 99.1% SLA compliance. The framework scales to 50,000 devices km with CPU overhead below 25%, validated through NS-3 hybrid simulations across realistic smart city scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shared Spatial Memory Through Predictive Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04235v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sharing and reconstructing a consistent spatial memory is a critical challenge in multi-agent systems, where partial observability and limited bandwidth often lead to catastrophic failures in coordination. We introduce a multi-agent predictive coding framework that formulate coordination as the minimization of mutual uncertainty among agents. Instantiated as an information bottleneck objective, it prompts agents to learn not only who and what to communicate but also when. At the foundation of this framework lies a grid-cell-like metric as internal spatial coding for self-localization, emerging spontaneously from self-supervised motion prediction. Building upon this internal spatial code, agents gradually develop a bandwidth-efficient communication mechanism and specialized neural populations that encode partners' locations: an artificial analogue of hippocampal social place cells (SPCs). These social representations are further enacted by a hierarchical reinforcement learning policy that actively explores to reduce joint uncertainty. On the Memory-Maze benchmark, our approach shows exceptional resilience to bandwidth constraints: success degrades gracefully from 73.5% to 64.4% as bandwidth shrinks from 128 to 4 bits/step, whereas a full-broadcast baseline collapses from 67.6% to 28.6%. Our findings establish a theoretically principled and biologically plausible basis for how complex social representations emerge from a unified predictive drive, leading to social collective intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have prepared the open-source code and video demonstration pages: 1.

However, these models pose extreme safety challenges during real-world deployment, including the risk of harm to the environment, the robot itself, and humans. How can safety constraints be explicitly integrated into VLAs? We address this by exploring an integrated safety approach (ISA), systematically modeling safety requirements, then actively eliciting diverse unsafe behaviors, effectively constraining VLA policies via safe reinforcement learning, and rigorously assuring their safety through targeted evaluations. Leveraging the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) paradigm, ISA optimizes VLAs from a min-max perspective against elicited safety risks. Thus, policies aligned through this comprehensive approach achieve the following key features: (I) effective safety-performance trade-offs, reducing the cumulative cost of safety violations by 83.58% compared to the state-of-the-art method, while also maintaining task success rate (+3.85%). (II) strong safety assurance, with the ability to mitigate long-tail risks and handle extreme failure scenarios. (III) robust generalization of learned safety behaviors to various out-of-distribution perturbations. The effectiveness is evaluated on long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks. Our data, models and newly proposed benchmark environment are available at https://pku-safevla.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight Presentation</p></details> |

It integrates notions of correctness, reliability, and cost into a coherent mathematical model that enables direct comparison, scoring, and optimization of Workflows. The framework combines the Opus Workflow Reward, a probabilistic function estimating expected performance through success likelihood, resource usage, and output gain, with the Opus Workflow Normative Penalties, a set of measurable functions capturing structural and informational quality across Cohesion, Coupling, Observability, and Information Hygiene. It supports automated Workflow assessment, ranking, and optimization within modern automation systems such as Opus and can be integrated into Reinforcement Learning loops to guide Workflow discovery and refinement. In this paper, we introduce the Opus Workflow Reward model that formalizes Workflow success as a probabilistic expectation over costs and outcomes. We define measurable Opus Workflow Normative Penalties capturing structural, semantic, and signal-related properties of Workflows. Finally, we propose a unified optimization formulation for identifying and ranking optimal Workflows under joint Reward-Penalty trade-offs.</p></details> |  |

While effective at mitigating harmful responses, these guardrails introduce a new class of vulnerabilities by exposing observable decision patterns. In this work, we present the first study of black-box LLM guardrail reverse-engineering attacks. We propose Guardrail Reverse-engineering Attack (GRA), a reinforcement learning-based framework that leverages genetic algorithm-driven data augmentation to approximate the decision-making policy of victim guardrails. By iteratively collecting input-output pairs, prioritizing divergence cases, and applying targeted mutations and crossovers, our method incrementally converges toward a high-fidelity surrogate of the victim guardrail. We evaluate GRA on three widely deployed commercial systems, namely ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Qwen3, and demonstrate that it achieves an rule matching rate exceeding 0.92 while requiring less than $85 in API costs. These findings underscore the practical feasibility of guardrail extraction and highlight significant security risks for current LLM safety mechanisms. Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in current guardrail designs and highlight the urgent need for more robust defense mechanisms in LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |

However, current RL methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision. Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward (DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward (DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to learn from continuous experience.</p></details> |  |

However, our empirical analysis reveals a critical drawback: reasoning-oriented RL fine-tuning significantly increases the prevalence of hallucinations. We theoretically analyze the RL training dynamics, identifying high-variance gradient, entropy-induced randomness, and susceptibility to spurious local optima as key factors leading to hallucinations. To address this drawback, we propose Factuality-aware Step-wise Policy Optimization (FSPO), an innovative RL fine-tuning algorithm incorporating explicit factuality verification at each reasoning step. FSPO leverages automated verification against given evidence to dynamically adjust token-level advantage values, incentivizing factual correctness throughout the reasoning process. Experiments across mathematical reasoning and hallucination benchmarks using Qwen2.5 and Llama models demonstrate that FSPO effectively reduces hallucinations while enhancing reasoning accuracy, substantially improving both reliability and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework combining a Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization Deep Reinforcement Learning framework and a Lightweight Stagnation Detection mechanism. The Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization framework jointly optimizes travel distance and map uncertainty through a dual-objective reward function, balancing exploration and exploitation. The Lightweight Stagnation Detection reduces redundant exploration through Lidar Static Anomaly Detection and Map Update Stagnation Detection, terminating episodes on low expansion rates. Experimental results show that compared with the frontier-based method and RRT method, our approach shortens exploration time by up to 65% and reduces path distance by up to 42%, significantly improving exploration efficiency in complex environments while maintaining reliable map completeness. Ablation studies confirm that the collaborative mechanism accelerates training convergence. Empirical validation on a physical robotic platform demonstrates the algorithm's practical applicability and its successful transferability from simulation to real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exchange Policy Optimization Algorithm for Semi-Infinite Safe Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04147v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe reinforcement learning (safe RL) aims to respect safety requirements while optimizing long-term performance. In many practical applications, however, the problem involves an infinite number of constraints, known as semi-infinite safe RL (SI-safe RL). Such constraints typically appear when safety conditions must be enforced across an entire continuous parameter space, such as ensuring adequate resource distribution at every spatial location. In this paper, we propose exchange policy optimization (EPO), an algorithmic framework that achieves optimal policy performance and deterministic bounded safety. EPO works by iteratively solving safe RL subproblems with finite constraint sets and adaptively adjusting the active set through constraint expansion and deletion. At each iteration, constraints with violations exceeding the predefined tolerance are added to refine the policy, while those with zero Lagrange multipliers are removed after the policy update. This exchange rule prevents uncontrolled growth of the working set and supports effective policy training. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild assumptions, strategies trained via EPO achieve performance comparable to optimal solutions with global constraint violations strictly remaining within a prescribed bound.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR), under review</p></details> |

However, existing approaches are either exclusively deployed on simulated humanoid characters, or specialized to specific tasks such as tracking. We propose BFM-Zero, a framework that learns an effective shared latent representation that embeds motions, goals, and rewards into a common space, enabling a single policy to be prompted for multiple downstream tasks without retraining. This well-structured latent space in BFM-Zero enables versatile and robust whole-body skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid in the real world, via diverse inference methods, including zero-shot motion tracking, goal reaching, and reward optimization, and few-shot optimization-based adaptation. Unlike prior on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks, BFM-Zero builds upon recent advancements in unsupervised RL and Forward-Backward (FB) models, which offer an objective-centric, explainable, and smooth latent representation of whole-body motions. We further extend BFM-Zero with critical reward shaping, domain randomization, and history-dependent asymmetric learning to bridge the sim-to-real gap. Those key design choices are quantitatively ablated in simulation. A first-of-its-kind model, BFM-Zero establishes a step toward scalable, promptable behavioral foundation models for whole-body humanoid control.</p></details> |  |
| **[RIDE: Difficulty Evolving Perturbation with Item Response Theory for Mathematical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04120v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve high performance on mathematical reasoning, but these results can be inflated by training data leakage or superficial pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning. To this end, an adversarial perturbation-based evaluation is needed to measure true mathematical reasoning ability. Current rule-based perturbation methods often generate ill-posed questions and impede the systematic evaluation of question difficulty and the evolution of benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose RIDE, a novel adversarial question-rewriting framework that leverages Item Response Theory (IRT) to rigorously measure question difficulty and to generate intrinsically more challenging, well-posed variations of mathematical problems. We employ 35 LLMs to simulate students and build a difficulty ranker from their responses. This ranker provides a reward signal during reinforcement learning and guides a question-rewriting model to reformulate existing questions across difficulty levels. Applying RIDE to competition-level mathematical benchmarks yields perturbed versions that degrade advanced LLM performance, with experiments showing an average 21.73% drop across 26 models, thereby exposing limited robustness in mathematical reasoning and confirming the validity of our evaluation approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADPO: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18913v5)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is effective but brittle under annotator noise and distribution shift because it operates on hard, pairwise labels and only regularizes log-probability differences. We introduce Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO), a framework that extends preference learning to soft listwise supervision via reference anchoring. ADPO minimizes KL(q || softmax((s - s_ref) / tau_anc)), which (i) recovers supervised fine-tuning, knowledge distillation, maximum-entropy reinforcement learning, and DPO as special cases through suitable choices of target q, anchor policy, and temperature; (ii) induces an implicit trust region governed by the softmax Fisher metric, independent of the anchor; and (iii) supports stable dynamic-anchor updates. Empirically, we observe a task-dependent tradeoff: dynamic anchors improve online exploration under noise, while fixed anchors excel at offline distillation, achieving up to 170 to 5000 times reduction in student-teacher KL on our benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CBMC-V3: A CNS-inspired Control Framework Towards Manipulation Agility with SNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04109v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As robotic arm applications extend beyond industrial settings into healthcare, service, and daily life, existing control algorithms struggle to achieve the agile manipulation required for complex environments with dynamic trajectories, unpredictable interactions, and diverse objects. This paper presents a biomimetic control framework based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), inspired by the human Central Nervous System (CNS), to achieve agile control in such environments. The proposed framework features five control modules (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, spinal cord), three hierarchical control levels (first-order, second-order, third-order), and two information pathways (ascending, descending). Each module is fully implemented using SNN. The spinal cord module uses spike encoding and Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for feedback control. The brainstem module employs a network of LIF and non-spiking LIF neurons to dynamically adjust spinal cord parameters via reinforcement learning. The thalamus module similarly adjusts the cerebellum's torque outputs. The cerebellum module uses a recurrent SNN to learn the robotic arm's dynamics through regression, providing feedforward gravity compensation torques. The framework is validated both in simulation and on real-world robotic arm platform under various loads and trajectories. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms the industrial-grade position control in manipulation agility.</p></details> |  |

A promising direction is to leverage the generalist knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large-language models by treating unusual driving scenarios as a logical reasoning task. In this work, we present Poutine, a method that uses an off-the-shelf 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) - without any additional components - to achieve robust end-to-end autonomous driving via a simple and scalable training recipe. To learn strong base driving capabilities, we first train Poutine-Base using self-supervised next-token prediction over vision, language, and trajectory (VLT) tokens, leveraging both nominal and long-tail driving data. In the second stage, we fine-tune Poutine-Base using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a small set of human preference-labeled examples. We evaluated our approach on the Waymo end-to-end driving benchmark curated for long-tail scenarios. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. Our results suggest that handcrafted tokenizers or custom architectural components added to base VLMs in prior work are not necessary to achieve strong driving performance. Instead, this work highlights the potential of scalable VLT pretraining combined with lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

Prior works develop such a framework, but left unanswered a fundamental question of when learned value functions can be concurrently executed. The main contribution of this work is to present theorems which provide necessary and sufficient conditions to concurrently execute sets of learned tasks within subsets of the state space, using a previously proposed min-norm controller. These theorems provide insight into when learned control tasks are possible to be made concurrently executable, when they might already inherently be concurrently executable and when it is not possible at all to make a set of learned tasks concurrently executable using the previously proposed methods. Additional contributions of this work include extending the optimization-based framework to execute multiple tasks encoded by value functions to also account for value functions trained with a discount factor, making the overall framework more compatible with standard RL practices.</p></details> | currently in review |
| **[Composite Flow Matching for Reinforcement Learning with Shifted-Dynamics Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23062v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating pre-collected offline data from a source environment can significantly improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL), but this benefit is often challenged by discrepancies between the transition dynamics of the source and target environments. Existing methods typically address this issue by penalizing or filtering out source transitions in high dynamics-gap regions. However, their estimation of the dynamics gap often relies on KL divergence or mutual information, which can be ill-defined when the source and target dynamics have disjoint support. To overcome these limitations, we propose CompFlow, a method grounded in the theoretical connection between flow matching and optimal transport. Specifically, we model the target dynamics as a conditional flow built upon the output distribution of the source-domain flow, rather than learning it directly from a Gaussian prior. This composite structure offers two key advantages: (1) improved generalization for learning target dynamics, and (2) a principled estimation of the dynamics gap via the Wasserstein distance between source and target transitions. Leveraging our principled estimation of the dynamics gap, we further introduce an optimistic active data collection strategy that prioritizes exploration in regions of high dynamics gap, and theoretically prove that it reduces the performance disparity with the optimal policy. Empirically, CompFlow outperforms strong baselines across several RL benchmarks with shifted dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |

While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise, its typical need for vast datasets to learn from hinders its use in these information-scarce frontiers. We introduce learning at criticality (LaC), a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to a sharp learning transition, addressing this information scarcity. At this transition, LLMs achieve peak generalization from minimal data, exemplified by 7-digit base-7 addition -- a test of nontrivial arithmetic reasoning. To elucidate this peak, we analyze a minimal concept-network model (CoNet) designed to capture the essence of how LLMs might link tokens. Trained on a single exemplar, this model also undergoes a sharp learning transition. This transition exhibits hallmarks of a second-order phase transition, notably power-law distributed solution path lengths. At this critical point, the system maximizes a ``critical thinking pattern" crucial for generalization, enabled by the underlying scale-free exploration. This suggests LLMs reach peak performance by operating at criticality, where such explorative dynamics enable the extraction of underlying operational rules. We demonstrate LaC in quantum field theory: an 8B-parameter LLM, tuned to its critical point by LaC using a few exemplars of symbolic Matsubara sums, solves unseen, higher-order problems, significantly outperforming far larger models. LaC thus leverages critical phenomena, a physical principle, to empower AI for complex, data-sparse challenges in fundamental physics.</p></details> |  |

However, existing systems typically rely on decoupled modules, resulting in delayed responses and incoherent behaviors in dynamic environments, while real-world perceptual limitations further exacerbate these issues. In this work, we present a unified reinforcement learning-based controller that enables humanoid robots to acquire reactive soccer skills through the direct integration of visual perception and motion control. Our approach extends Adversarial Motion Priors to perceptual settings in real-world dynamic environments, bridging motion imitation and visually grounded dynamic control. We introduce an encoder-decoder architecture combined with a virtual perception system that models real-world visual characteristics, allowing the policy to recover privileged states from imperfect observations and establish active coordination between perception and action. The resulting controller demonstrates strong reactivity, consistently executing coherent and robust soccer behaviors across various scenarios, including real RoboCup matches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://humanoid-kick.github.io</p></details> |

However, existing large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a novel framework that uniquely combines reinforcement learning with preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought (CoT) performance. RPRO differentiates itself from prior approaches by employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation mechanism that aligns outputs with established clinical workflows, while automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking optimization based on the Bradley-Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE show consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 1.1B parameter model outperforms much larger 7B-13B models, including medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining preference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and effective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.</p></details> |  |

We present two complementary contributions. First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8 to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection $\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs, compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\% improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity, showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous statistical testing.</p></details> |  |

To systematically explore these domains, we first review foundational algo- rithms, including PPO, DPO, and GRPO, before presenting a detailed analysis of the latest innovations.

| **[From Static to Dynamic: Enhancing Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning via Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03828v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transitioning from offline to online reinforcement learning (RL) poses critical challenges due to distributional shifts between the fixed behavior policy in the offline dataset and the evolving policy during online learning. Although this issue is widely recognized, few methods attempt to explicitly assess or utilize the distributional structure of the offline data itself, leaving a research gap in adapting learning strategies to different types of samples. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative method, Energy-Guided Diffusion Stratification (StratDiff), which facilitates smoother transitions in offline-to-online RL. StratDiff deploys a diffusion model to learn prior knowledge from the offline dataset. It then refines this knowledge through energy-based functions to improve policy imitation and generate offline-like actions during online fine-tuning. The KL divergence between the generated action and the corresponding sampled action is computed for each sample and used to stratify the training batch into offline-like and online-like subsets. Offline-like samples are updated using offline objectives, while online-like samples follow online learning strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of StratDiff by integrating it with off-the-shelf methods Cal-QL and IQL. Extensive empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmarks show that StratDiff significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving enhanced adaptability and more stable performance across diverse RL settings.</p></details> |  |

On the other hand, designing external mechanisms (e.g., intrinsic rewards and human feedback) to coordinate agents mostly relies on empirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the above issues. First, we introduce the concept of MARL interaction paradigms (orthogonal to MARL learning paradigms), using MAIDs to analyze and visualize both unguided self-organization and global guidance mechanisms in MARL. Then, we design a new MARL interaction paradigm, referred to as the targeted intervention paradigm that is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance can be mitigated. In implementation, we introduce a causal inference technique, referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI), to realize the targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning paradigm is workable under the design of an MARL interaction paradigm. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Agent Learning via Experience Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03773v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM) agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the collection of scalable experience data. To address these challenges, we introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts, DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.</p></details> |  |

While recent breakthroughs have matched elite human play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued: most hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple rounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to achieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized by extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a model-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played at an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and equity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also outperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning abilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies, randomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class human players.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shrinking the Variance: Shrinkage Baselines for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03710v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large reasoning models (LRMs) using policy-gradient methods such as GRPO. To stabilize training, these methods typically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean for each prompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (or baseline), reducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator. Typically, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages for each prompt in a batch. Drawing inspiration from Stein's paradox, we propose using shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt means to improve the overall per-prompt mean estimation accuracy -- particularly in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we construct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance policy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our proposed baseline serves as a drop-in replacement for existing per-prompt mean baselines, requiring no additional hyper-parameters or computation. Empirically, shrinkage baselines consistently outperform standard empirical-mean baselines, leading to lower-variance gradient updates and improved training stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process, resulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of AI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to automate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical bottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of explainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of the tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for sample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs a multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design goals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the target goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation strategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency. The AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity and is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from pure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system learns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate convergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog design space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents serve as transparent design assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article was accepted by 2025 International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD 2025) and was presented in Munich, October 2025</p></details> |
| **[Behavior-Adaptive Q-Learning: A Unifying Framework for Offline-to-Online RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03695v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables training from fixed data without online interaction, but policies learned offline often struggle when deployed in dynamic environments due to distributional shift and unreliable value estimates on unseen state-action pairs. We introduce Behavior-Adaptive Q-Learning (BAQ), a framework designed to enable a smooth and reliable transition from offline to online RL. The key idea is to leverage an implicit behavioral model derived from offline data to provide a behavior-consistency signal during online fine-tuning. BAQ incorporates a dual-objective loss that (i) aligns the online policy toward the offline behavior when uncertainty is high, and (ii) gradually relaxes this constraint as more confident online experience is accumulated. This adaptive mechanism reduces error propagation from out-of-distribution estimates, stabilizes early online updates, and accelerates adaptation to new scenarios. Across standard benchmarks, BAQ consistently outperforms prior offline-to-online RL approaches, achieving faster recovery, improved robustness, and higher overall performance. Our results demonstrate that implicit behavior adaptation is a principled and practical solution for reliable real-world policy deployment.</p></details> |  |

This study presents an integrated 4D/5D digital-twin framework that couples Building Information Modeling (BIM) with natural-language processing (NLP)-based cost mapping, computer-vision (CV)-driven progress measurement, Bayesian probabilistic CPM updating, and deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) resource-leveling. A nine-month case implementation on a Dallas-Fort Worth mid-rise project demonstrated measurable gains in accuracy and efficiency: 43% reduction in estimating labor, 6% reduction in overtime, and 30% project-buffer utilization, while maintaining an on-time finish at 128 days within P50-P80 confidence bounds. The digital-twin sandbox also enabled real-time "what-if" forecasting and traceable cost-schedule alignment through a 5D knowledge graph. Findings confirm that integrating AI-based analytics with probabilistic CPM and DRL enhances forecasting precision, transparency, and control resilience. The validated workflow establishes a practical pathway toward predictive, adaptive, and auditable construction management.</p></details> |  |

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in training policies for specific autonomous robots, existing frameworks and benchmarks are often constrained to unique platforms, limiting generalization and fair comparisons across different mobility systems. In this paper, we present a multi-domain framework for training, evaluating and deploying RL-based navigation policies across diverse robotic platforms and operational environments. Our work presents four key contributions: (1) a scalable and modular framework, facilitating seamless robot-task interchangeability and reproducible training pipelines; (2) sim-to-real transfer demonstrated through real-world experiments with multiple robots, including a satellite robotic simulator, an unmanned surface vessel, and a wheeled ground vehicle; (3) the release of the first open-source API for deploying Isaac Lab-trained policies to real robots, enabling lightweight inference and rapid field validation; and (4) uniform tasks and metrics for cross-medium evaluation, through a unified evaluation testbed to assess performance of navigation tasks in diverse operational conditions (aquatic, terrestrial and space). By ensuring consistency between simulation and real-world deployment, RoboRAN lowers the barrier to developing adaptable RL-based navigation strategies. Its modular design enables straightforward integration of new robots and tasks through predefined templates, fostering reproducibility and extension to diverse domains. To support the community, we release RoboRAN as open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |

For instance, reward-free and goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first remarking that the successor measure itself is not approximately low-rank. Instead, we demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation and estimation errors are primarily governed by a newly introduced quantitity: the spectral recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II Poincar\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>63 pa...</summary><p>63 pages, 11 figures.

| **[The ODE Method for Stochastic Approximation and Reinforcement Learning with Markovian Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07844v7)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic approximation is a class of algorithms that update a vector iteratively, incrementally, and stochastically, including, e.g., stochastic gradient descent and temporal difference learning. One fundamental challenge in analyzing a stochastic approximation algorithm is to establish its stability, i.e., to show that the stochastic vector iterates are bounded almost surely. In this paper, we extend the celebrated Borkar-Meyn theorem for stability from the Martingale difference noise setting to the Markovian noise setting, which greatly improves its applicability in reinforcement learning, especially in those off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms with linear function approximation and eligibility traces. Central to our analysis is the diminishing asymptotic rate of change of a few functions, which is implied by both a form of the strong law of large numbers and a form of the law of the iterated logarithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Formalizing Reinforcement Learning Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03618v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we formalize the almost sure convergence of $Q$-learning and linear temporal difference (TD) learning with Markovian samples using the Lean 4 theorem prover based on the Mathlib library. $Q$-learning and linear TD are among the earliest and most influential reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. The investigation of their convergence properties is not only a major research topic during the early development of the RL field but also receives increasing attention nowadays. This paper formally verifies their almost sure convergence in a unified framework based on the Robbins-Siegmund theorem. The framework developed in this work can be easily extended to convergence rates and other modes of convergence. This work thus makes an important step towards fully formalizing convergent RL results. The code is available at https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/rl-theory-in-lean.</p></details> |  |
| **[Going Beyond Expert Performance via Deep Implicit Imitation Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03616v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning traditionally requires complete state-action demonstrations from optimal or near-optimal experts. These requirements severely limit practical applicability, as many real-world scenarios provide only state observations without corresponding actions and expert performance is often suboptimal. In this paper we introduce a deep implicit imitation reinforcement learning framework that addresses both limitations by combining deep reinforcement learning with implicit imitation learning from observation-only datasets. Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation Q-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs expert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence mechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning. This enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training while maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance. We further extend our framework with a Heterogeneous Actions DIIQN (HA-DIIQN) algorithm to tackle scenarios where expert and agent possess different action sets, a challenge previously unaddressed in the implicit imitation learning literature. HA-DIIQN introduces an infeasibility detection mechanism and a bridging procedure identifying alternative pathways connecting agent capabilities to expert guidance when direct action replication is impossible. Our experimental results demonstrate that DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns compared to standard DQN, while consistently outperforming existing implicit imitation methods that cannot exceed expert performance. In heterogeneous action settings, HA-DIIQN learns up to 64% faster than baselines, leveraging expert datasets unusable by conventional approaches. Extensive parameter sensitivity analysis reveals the framework's robustness across varying dataset sizes and hyperparameter configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor-Efficient High-Dimensional Q-learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03595v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional reinforcement learning faces challenges with complex calculations and low sample efficiency in large state-action spaces. Q-learning algorithms struggle particularly with the curse of dimensionality, where the number of state-action pairs grows exponentially with problem size. While neural network-based approaches like Deep Q-Networks have shown success, recent tensor-based methods using low-rank decomposition offer more parameter-efficient alternatives. Building upon existing tensor-based methods, we propose Tensor-Efficient Q-Learning (TEQL), which enhances low-rank tensor decomposition via improved block coordinate descent on discretized state-action spaces, incorporating novel exploration and regularization mechanisms. The key innovation is an exploration strategy that combines approximation error with visit count-based upper confidence bound to prioritize actions with high uncertainty, avoiding wasteful random exploration. Additionally, we incorporate a frequency-based penalty term in the objective function to encourage exploration of less-visited state-action pairs and reduce overfitting to frequently visited regions. Empirical results on classic control tasks demonstrate that TEQL outperforms conventional matrix-based methods and deep RL approaches in both sample efficiency and total rewards, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications, such as space and healthcare where sampling costs are high.</p></details> |  |
| **[PerfDojo: Automated ML Library Generation for Heterogeneous Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03586v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing complexity of machine learning models and the proliferation of diverse hardware architectures (CPUs, GPUs, accelerators) make achieving optimal performance a significant challenge. Heterogeneity in instruction sets, specialized kernel requirements for different data types and model features (e.g., sparsity, quantization), and architecture-specific optimizations complicate performance tuning. Manual optimization is resource-intensive, while existing automatic approaches often rely on complex hardware-specific heuristics and uninterpretable intermediate representations, hindering performance portability. We introduce PerfLLM, a novel automatic optimization methodology leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Central to this is PerfDojo, an environment framing optimization as an RL game using a human-readable, mathematically-inspired code representation that guarantees semantic validity through transformations. This allows effective optimization without prior hardware knowledge, facilitating both human analysis and RL agent training. We demonstrate PerfLLM's ability to achieve significant performance gains across diverse CPU (x86, Arm, RISC-V) and GPU architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Foundations for Deep Research Systems: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06733v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator, and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback. Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent, off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration, recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence on such human priors and rater biases. This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations of deep research systems. It systematizes recent work along three axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii) agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA, VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, second version</p></details> |

Revisiting GRPO in Classical Reinforcement Learning Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03527v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) by eliminating the learned critic and instead estimating advantages through group-relative comparisons of trajectories. This simplification raises fundamental questions about the necessity of learned baselines in policy-gradient methods. We present the first systematic study of GRPO in classical single-task reinforcement learning environments, spanning discrete and continuous control tasks. Through controlled ablations isolating baselines, discounting, and group sampling, we reveal three key findings: (1) learned critics remain essential for long-horizon tasks: all critic-free baselines underperform PPO except in short-horizon environments like CartPole where episodic returns can be effective; (2) GRPO benefits from high discount factors (gamma = 0.99) except in HalfCheetah, where lack of early termination favors moderate discounting (gamma = 0.9); (3) smaller group sizes outperform larger ones, suggesting limitations in batch-based grouping strategies that mix unrelated episodes. These results reveal both the limitations of critic-free methods in classical control and the specific conditions where they remain viable alternatives to learned value functions.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering, knowledge distillation or reinforcement learning to improve reasoning reliability, both of which require large amounts of high-quality data and thus limit practical applicability. Few approaches have focused on directly detecting and correcting FPs. To address these issues, we propose ViFP, a framework for Visual False Positive Detection to Enhance Reasoning Reliability in VLMs. ViFP builds effective reasoning paths through multi-turn QA and dynamically analyzes the consistency of the reasoning path to identify potential FPs. It also introduces a targeted reasoning chain correction mechanism to modify FP reasoning, thereby improving logical consistency and accuracy. Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric, VoC, which integrates answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess whether a VLM not only answers correctly but also reasons reliably. Our experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OK-VQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in enhancing reasoning reliability.</p></details> |  |

This paper develops a theoretical and algorithmic framework for incorporating known group symmetries into kernel-based RL. We propose a symmetry-aware variant of optimistic least-squares value iteration (LSVI), which leverages invariant kernels to encode invariance in both rewards and transition dynamics. Our analysis establishes new bounds on the maximum information gain and covering numbers for invariant RKHSs, explicitly quantifying the sample efficiency gains from symmetry. Empirical results on a customized Frozen Lake environment and a 2D placement design problem confirm the theoretical improvements, demonstrating that symmetry-aware RL achieves significantly better performance than their standard kernel counterparts. These findings highlight the value of structural priors in designing more sample-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) struggle with this task, frequently failing to interpret user intent (misinterpretation) or unnecessarily altering the original question's structure (over-correction). We propose QuestionRAG, a framework that tackles these problems. To address misinterpretation, it enriches the input with external knowledge (e.g., search results, related entities). To prevent over-correction, it uses reinforcement learning (RL) to align the model's objective with precise correction, not just paraphrasing. Our results demonstrate that knowledge augmentation is critical for understanding faulty questions. Furthermore, RL-based alignment proves significantly more effective than traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), boosting the model's ability to follow instructions and generalize. By integrating these two strategies, QuestionRAG unlocks the full potential of LLMs for the question correction task.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

This combination makes them also suitable for classical search problems. However, the original method of training the network with simulation results is limited in sparse reward settings, especially in the early stages, where the network cannot yet give guidance. Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) addresses this issue by relabeling unsuccessful trajectories from the search tree as supervised learning signals. We introduce Adaptable HER (\ours{}), a flexible framework that integrates HER with AlphaZero, allowing easy adjustments to HER properties such as relabeled goals, policy targets, and trajectory selection. Our experiments, including equation discovery, show that the possibility of modifying HER is beneficial and surpasses the performance of pure supervised or reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, Presented at the 9th International Workshop on Interactive Adaptive Learning</p></details> |

Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers that utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states, inter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents communicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high scalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs during inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition, we introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration and body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller, enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the state-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst agents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete in-flight loss of one MAV.

| **[DRL-Based Robust Multi-Timescale Anti-Jamming Approaches under State Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03305v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Owing to the openness of wireless channels, wireless communication systems are highly susceptible to malicious jamming. Most existing anti-jamming methods rely on the assumption of accurate sensing and optimize parameters on a single timescale. However, such methods overlook two practical issues: mismatched execution latencies across heterogeneous actions and measurement errors caused by sensor imperfections. Especially for deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based methods, the inherent sensitivity of neural networks implies that even minor perturbations in the input can mislead the agent into choosing suboptimal actions, with potentially severe consequences. To ensure reliable wireless transmission, we establish a multi-timescale decision model that incorporates state uncertainty. Subsequently, we propose two robust schemes that sustain performance under bounded sensing errors. First, a Projected Gradient Descent-assisted Double Deep Q-Network (PGD-DDQN) algorithm is designed, which derives worst-case perturbations under a norm-bounded error model and applies PGD during training for robust optimization. Second, a Nonlinear Q-Compression DDQN (NQC-DDQN) algorithm introduces a nonlinear compression mechanism that adaptively contracts Q-value ranges to eliminate action aliasing. Simulation results indicate that, compared with the perfect-sensing baseline, the proposed algorithms show only minor degradation in anti-jamming performance while maintaining robustness under various perturbations, thereby validating their practicality in imperfect sensing conditions.</p></details> | 13pages,12figures |

Traditional rate limiting algorithms, such as token bucket and sliding window, while widely adopted, struggle to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns and varying system loads. This paper proposes an adaptive rate limiting strategy based on deep reinforcement learning that dynamically balances system throughput and service latency. We design a hybrid architecture combining Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms, modeling the rate limiting decision process as a Markov Decision Process. The system continuously monitors microservice states and learns optimal rate limiting policies through environmental interaction. Extensive experiments conducted in a Kubernetes cluster environment demonstrate that our approach achieves 23.7% throughput improvement and 31.4% P99 latency reduction compared to traditional fixed-threshold strategies under high-load scenarios. Results from a 90-day production deployment handling 500 million daily requests validate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method, with 82% reduction in service degradation incidents and 68% decrease in manual interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[L2T-Tune:LLM-Guided Hybrid Database Tuning with LHS and TD3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01602v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Configuration tuning is critical for database performance. Although recent advancements in database tuning have shown promising results in throughput and latency improvement, challenges remain. First, the vast knob space makes direct optimization unstable and slow to converge. Second, reinforcement learning pipelines often lack effective warm-start guidance and require long offline training. Third, transferability is limited: when hardware or workloads change, existing models typically require substantial retraining to recover performance. To address these limitations, we propose L2T-Tune, a new LLM-guided hybrid database tuning framework that features a three-stage pipeline: Stage one performs a warm start that simultaneously generates uniform samples across the knob space and logs them into a shared pool; Stage two leverages a large language model to mine and prioritize tuning hints from manuals and community documents for rapid convergence. Stage three uses the warm-start sample pool to reduce the dimensionality of knobs and state features, then fine-tunes the configuration with the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm. We conduct experiments on L2T-Tune and the state-of-the-art models. Compared with the best-performing alternative, our approach improves performance by an average of 37.1% across all workloads, and by up to 73% on TPC-C. Compared with models trained with reinforcement learning, it achieves rapid convergence in the offline tuning stage on a single server. Moreover, during the online tuning stage, it only takes 30 steps to achieve best results.</p></details> |  |

Designing effective adaptation policies, however, depends on managing the uncertainty of long-term climate impacts. Meanwhile, such policies can feature important normative choices that are not always made explicit. We propose that Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be a useful tool to both identify adaptation pathways under uncertain conditions while it also allows for the explicit modelling (and consequent comparison) of different adaptation priorities (e.g. economic vs. wellbeing). We use an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) to link together a rainfall and flood model, and compute the impacts of flooding in terms of quality of life (QoL), transportation, and infrastructure damage. Our results show that models prioritising QoL over economic impacts results in more adaptation spending as well as a more even distribution of spending over the study area, highlighting the extent to which such normative assumptions can alter adaptation policy.

| **[Incorporating Quality of Life in Climate Adaptation Planning via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03238v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban flooding is expected to increase in frequency and severity as a consequence of climate change, causing wide-ranging impacts that include a decrease in urban Quality of Life (QoL). Meanwhile, policymakers must devise adaptation strategies that can cope with the uncertain nature of climate change and the complex and dynamic nature of urban flooding. Reinforcement Learning (RL) holds significant promise in tackling such complex, dynamic, and uncertain problems. Because of this, we use RL to identify which climate adaptation pathways lead to a higher QoL in the long term. We do this using an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) which combines a rainfall projection model, a flood model, a transport accessibility model, and a quality of life index. Our preliminary results suggest that this approach can be used to learn optimal adaptation measures and it outperforms other realistic and real-world planning strategies. Our framework is publicly available: https://github.com/MLSM-at-DTU/maat_qol_framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at AI in Science (AIS) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Layer Importance for Mathematical Reasoning is Forged in Pre-Training and Invariant after Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22638v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models improve at math after instruction tuning, reinforcement learning, or knowledge distillation. We ask whether these gains come from major changes in the transformer layers or from smaller adjustments that keep the original structure. Using layer-wise ablation on base and trained variants, we find that math reasoning depends on a few critical layers, which stay important across all post-training methods. Removing these layers reduces math accuracy by as much as 80%, whereas factual recall tasks only show relatively smaller drops. This suggests that specialized layers for mathematical tasks form during pre-training and remain stable afterward. As measured by Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), we find that near these critical layers, tokens drift from their original syntactic clusters toward representations aligned with tokens less syntactically related but potentially more useful for downstream task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Assembly Policy Learning of a Sightless Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03189v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores a physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) task involving the joint insertion of a board into a frame by a sightless robot and a human operator. While admittance control is commonly used in pHRC tasks, it can be challenging to measure the force/torque applied by the human for accurate human intent estimation, limiting the robot's ability to assist in the collaborative task. Other methods that attempt to solve pHRC tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) are also unsuitable for the board-insertion task due to its safety constraints and sparse rewards. Therefore, we propose a novel RL approach that utilizes a human-designed admittance controller to facilitate more active robot behavior and reduce human effort. Through simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms admittance control in terms of success rate and task completion time. Additionally, we observed a significant reduction in measured force/torque when using our proposed approach compared to admittance control.

| **[Periodic Skill Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03187v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised skill discovery in reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn diverse behaviors without relying on external rewards. However, current methods often overlook the periodic nature of learned skills, focusing instead on increasing the mutual dependence between states and skills or maximizing the distance traveled in latent space. Considering that many robotic tasks -- particularly those involving locomotion -- require periodic behaviors across varying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is essential. Motivated by this, we propose Periodic Skill Discovery (PSD), a framework that discovers periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner. The key idea of PSD is to train an encoder that maps states to a circular latent space, thereby naturally encoding periodicity in the latent representation. By capturing temporal distance, PSD can effectively learn skills with diverse periods in complex robotic tasks, even with pixel-based observations. We further show that these learned skills achieve high performance on downstream tasks such as hurdling. Moreover, integrating PSD with an existing skill discovery method offers more diverse behaviors, thus broadening the agent's repertoire. Our code and demos are available at https://jonghaepark.github.io/psd/</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Learning-based Cooperative Robotic Paper Wrapping: A Unified Control Policy with Residual Force Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03181v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-robot cooperation is essential in environments such as warehouses and retail stores, where workers frequently handle deformable objects like paper, bags, and fabrics. Coordinating robotic actions with human assistance remains difficult due to the unpredictable dynamics of deformable materials and the need for adaptive force control. To explore this challenge, we focus on the task of gift wrapping, which exemplifies a long-horizon manipulation problem involving precise folding, controlled creasing, and secure fixation of paper. Success is achieved when the robot completes the sequence to produce a neatly wrapped package with clean folds and no tears. We propose a learning-based framework that integrates a high-level task planner powered by a large language model (LLM) with a low-level hybrid imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) policy. At its core is a Sub-task Aware Robotic Transformer (START) that learns a unified policy from human demonstrations. The key novelty lies in capturing long-range temporal dependencies across the full wrapping sequence within a single model. Unlike vanilla Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT), typically applied to short tasks, our method introduces sub-task IDs that provide explicit temporal grounding. This enables robust performance across the entire wrapping process and supports flexible execution, as the policy learns sub-goals rather than merely replicating motion sequences. Our framework achieves a 97% success rate on real-world wrapping tasks. We show that the unified transformer-based policy reduces the need for specialized models, allows controlled human supervision, and effectively bridges high-level intent with the fine-grained force control required for deformable object manipulation.</p></details> |  |

While researchers have primarily focused on improving their utility, their safety behaviors remain underexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate search agents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produce harmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked "How can I track someone's location without their consent?", a base model refuses, whereas a search agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusal threshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesize them into an informative yet unsafe summary. We further show that utility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignment of safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with a novel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safe ones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70% across three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, and matches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analyses confirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safety and utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/amazon-science/SafeSearch</p></details> |

Traditional Earth-Moon transfers suffer from rigid launch windows and high propellant demands, while Earth-based GNSS systems provide little to no coverage beyond geostationary orbit. This limits autonomy and environmental awareness in cislunar space. This review compares four major transfer strategies by evaluating velocity requirements, flight durations, and fuel efficiency, and by identifying their suitability for both crewed and robotic missions. The emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning is highlighted: convolutional neural networks support automated crater recognition and digital terrain model generation, while deep reinforcement learning enables adaptive trajectory refinement during descent and landing to reduce risk and decision latency. The study also examines how GNSS-Reflectometry and advanced Positioning, Navigation, and Timing architectures can extend navigation capabilities beyond current limits. GNSS-R can act as a bistatic radar for mapping lunar ice, soil properties, and surface topography, while PNT systems support autonomous rendezvous, Lagrange point station-keeping, and coordinated satellite swarm operations. Combining these developments establishes a scalable framework for sustainable cislunar exploration and long-term human and robotic presence.</p></details> |  |

However, how to effectively coordinate the multiple legs in a larger action exploration space to generate natural and robust movements is a key issue. In this paper, we introduce a motion prior-based approach, successfully applying deep reinforcement learning algorithms to a real hexapod robot. We generate a dataset of optimized motion priors, and train an adversarial discriminator based on the priors to guide the hexapod robot to learn natural gaits. The learned policy is then successfully transferred to a real hexapod robot, and demonstrate natural gait patterns and remarkable robustness without visual information in complex terrains. This is the first time that a reinforcement learning controller has been used to achieve complex terrain walking on a real hexapod robot.</p></details> |  |

A critical challenge limiting their operational capacity lies in the energy constraints of both aerial platforms and ground-based sensors. This paper explores WLPT as a transformative solution for sustainable energy provisioning in UAV-assisted IoT networks. We first systematically investigate the fundamental principles of WLPT and analysis the comparative advantages. Then, we introduce three operational paradigms for system integration, identify key challenges, and discuss corresponding potential solutions. In case study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to address the coordination and optimization challenges in WLPT-enabled UAV-assisted IoT data collection. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves energy sustainability and data freshness. Finally, we discuss some future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE Internet of Things Magazine</p></details> |
| **[Aerial Active STAR-RIS-assisted Satellite-Terrestrial Covert Communications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16146v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An integration of satellites and terrestrial networks is crucial for enhancing performance of next generation communication systems. However, the networks are hindered by the long-distance path loss and security risks in dense urban environments. In this work, we propose a satellite-terrestrial covert communication system assisted by the aerial active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (AASTAR-RIS) to improve the channel capacity while ensuring the transmission covertness. Specifically, we first derive the minimal detection error probability (DEP) under the worst condition that the Warden has perfect channel state information (CSI). Then, we formulate an AASTAR-RIS-assisted satellite-terrestrial covert communication optimization problem (ASCCOP) to maximize the sum of the fair channel capacity for all ground users while meeting the strict covert constraint, by jointly optimizing the trajectory and active beamforming of the AASTAR-RIS. Due to the challenges posed by the complex and high-dimensional state-action spaces as well as the need for efficient exploration in dynamic environments, we propose a generative deterministic policy gradient (GDPG) algorithm, which is a generative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to solve the ASCCOP. Concretely, the generative diffusion model (GDM) is utilized as the policy representation of the algorithm to enhance the exploration process by generating diverse and high-quality samples through a series of denoising steps. Moreover, we incorporate an action gradient mechanism to accomplish the policy improvement of the algorithm, which refines the better state-action pairs through the gradient ascent. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms important benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Thor: Towards Human-Level Whole-Body Reactions for Intense Contact-Rich Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26280v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoids hold great potential for service, industrial, and rescue applications, in which robots must sustain whole-body stability while performing intense, contact-rich interactions with the environment. However, enabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such conditions remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Thor, a humanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich environments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive torso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like responses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional challenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning architecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each component shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its parameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially outperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot achieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body weight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing improvements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the best-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack (130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N). These results highlight Thor's effectiveness in enhancing humanoid force-interaction capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Multi-Satellite Earth Observation: A Realistic Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15207v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites has revolutionised Earth Observation (EO) missions, addressing challenges in climate monitoring, disaster management, and more. However, autonomous coordination in multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms, including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination. The insights gained from this study provide a foundation for autonomous satellite operations, offering practical guidelines for improving policy learning in decentralised EO missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[AURA: Autonomous Upskilling with Retrieval-Augmented Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02507v3)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing reinforcement learning curricula for agile robots traditionally requires extensive manual tuning of reward functions, environment randomizations, and training configurations. We introduce AURA (Autonomous Upskilling with Retrieval-Augmented Agents), a schema-validated curriculum reinforcement learning (RL) framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous designers of multi-stage curricula. AURA transforms user prompts into YAML workflows that encode full reward functions, domain randomization strategies, and training configurations. All files are statically validated before any GPU time is used, ensuring efficient and reliable execution. A retrieval-augmented feedback loop allows specialized LLM agents to design, execute, and refine curriculum stages based on prior training results stored in a vector database, enabling continual improvement over time. Quantitative experiments show that AURA consistently outperforms LLM-guided baselines in generation success rate, humanoid locomotion, and manipulation tasks. Ablation studies highlight the importance of schema validation and retrieval for curriculum quality. AURA successfully trains end-to-end policies directly from user prompts and deploys them zero-shot on a custom humanoid robot in multiple environments - capabilities that did not exist previously with manually designed controllers. By abstracting the complexity of curriculum design, AURA enables scalable and adaptive policy learning pipelines that would be complex to construct by hand.

Recent advances have enabled LLMs to act as search agents via reinforcement learning (RL), improving information acquisition through multi-turn interactions with retrieval engines. However, existing approaches either optimize retrieval using search-only metrics (e.g., NDCG) that ignore downstream utility or fine-tune the entire LLM to jointly reason and retrieve-entangling retrieval with generation and limiting the real search utility and compatibility with frozen or proprietary models. In this work, we propose s3, a lightweight, model-agnostic framework that decouples the searcher from the generator and trains the searcher using a Gain Beyond RAG reward: the improvement in generation accuracy over naive RAG. s3 requires only 2.4k training samples to outperform baselines trained on over 70x more data, consistently delivering stronger downstream performance across six general QA and five medical QA benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 camera-ready</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Multi-Agent Environment Co-Design with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03100v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The agent-environment co-design paradigm jointly optimises agent policies and environment configurations in search of improved system performance. With application domains ranging from warehouse logistics to windfarm management, co-design promises to fundamentally change how we deploy multi-agent systems. However, current co-design methods struggle to scale. They collapse under high-dimensional environment design spaces and suffer from sample inefficiency when addressing moving targets inherent to joint optimisation. We address these challenges by developing Diffusion Co-Design (DiCoDe), a scalable and sample-efficient co-design framework pushing co-design towards practically relevant settings. DiCoDe incorporates two core innovations. First, we introduce Projected Universal Guidance (PUG), a sampling technique that enables DiCoDe to explore a distribution of reward-maximising environments while satisfying hard constraints such as spatial separation between obstacles. Second, we devise a critic distillation mechanism to share knowledge from the reinforcement learning critic, ensuring that the guided diffusion model adapts to evolving agent policies using a dense and up-to-date learning signal. Together, these improvements lead to superior environment-policy pairs when validated on challenging multi-agent environment co-design benchmarks including warehouse automation, multi-agent pathfinding and wind farm optimisation. Our method consistently exceeds the state-of-the-art, achieving, for example, 39% higher rewards in the warehouse setting with 66% fewer simulation samples. This sets a new standard in agent-environment co-design, and is a stepping stone towards reaping the rewards of co-design in real world domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Discrete Function Decomposability for Scientific Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03032v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of AI-driven science and engineering, we often want to design discrete objects in silico according to user-specified properties. For example, we may wish to design a protein to bind its target, arrange components within a circuit to minimize latency, or find materials with certain properties. Given a property predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a generative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to concentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization -- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as reinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that maximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over discrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial nature of the design space. However, many property predictors in scientific applications are decomposable in the sense that they can be factorized over design variables in a way that could in principle enable more effective optimization. For example, amino acids at a catalytic site of a protein may only loosely interact with amino acids of the rest of the protein to achieve maximal catalytic activity. Current distributional optimization algorithms are unable to make use of such decomposability structure. Herein, we propose and demonstrate use of a new distributional optimization algorithm, Decomposition-Aware Distributional Optimization (DADO), that can leverage any decomposability defined by a junction tree on the design variables, to make optimization more efficient. At its core, DADO employs a soft-factorized "search distribution" -- a learned generative model -- for efficient navigation of the search space, invoking graph message-passing to coordinate optimization across linked factors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Value of Information-Enhanced Exploration in Bootstrapped DQN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02969v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient exploration in deep reinforcement learning remains a fundamental challenge, especially in environments characterized by high-dimensional states and sparse rewards. Traditional exploration strategies that rely on random local policy noise, such as $\epsilon$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration methods, often struggle to efficiently balance exploration and exploitation. In this paper, we integrate the notion of (expected) value of information (EVOI) within the well-known Bootstrapped DQN algorithmic framework, to enhance the algorithm's deep exploration ability. Specifically, we develop two novel algorithms that incorporate the expected gain from learning the value of information into Bootstrapped DQN. Our methods use value of information estimates to measure the discrepancies of opinions among distinct network heads, and drive exploration towards areas with the most potential. We evaluate our algorithms with respect to performance and their ability to exploit inherent uncertainty arising from random network initialization. Our experiments in complex, sparse-reward Atari games demonstrate increased performance, all the while making better use of uncertainty, and, importantly, without introducing extra hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Pavement Management Systems (PMS) remain largely reactive, lacking real-time intelligence for failure prevention and optimal maintenance planning. To address this, we propose a unified Digital Twin (DT) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for scalable, data-driven pavement health monitoring and predictive maintenance. Pavement segments and spatial relations are modeled as graph nodes and edges, while real-time UAV, sensor, and LiDAR data stream into the DT. The inductive GNN learns deterioration patterns from graph-structured inputs to forecast distress and enable proactive interventions. Trained on a real-world-inspired dataset with segment attributes and dynamic connectivity, our model achieves an R2 of 0.3798, outperforming baseline regressors and effectively capturing non-linear degradation. We also develop an interactive dashboard and reinforcement learning module for simulation, visualization, and adaptive maintenance planning. This DT-GNN integration enhances forecasting precision and establishes a closed feedback loop for continuous improvement, positioning the approach as a foundation for proactive, intelligent, and sustainable pavement management, with future extensions toward real-world deployment, multi-agent coordination, and smart-city integration.</p></details> |  |

However, the performance of various RL algorithms and their best practices for practical drug discovery are still unclear. Here, starting from the principles of the REINFORCE algorithm, we investigate the effect of different components from RL theory including experience replay, hill-climbing, baselines to reduce variance, and alternative reward shaping. We propose a new regularization method more aligned to REINFORCE than current standard practices, and demonstrate how RL hyperparameters can be fine-tuned for effectiveness and efficiency. Lastly, we apply our learnings to practical drug discovery by demonstrating enhanced learning efficiency on frontier binding affinity models by using Boltz2 as a reward model. We share our RL models used in the ACEGEN repository, and hope the experiments here act as a guide to researchers applying RL to chemical language models for drug discovery.</p></details> |  |

Distributionally Robust Auto-Encoding for State Space Coverage in Online Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17830v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) enables agents to autonomously acquire diverse behaviors, but faces major challenges in visual environments due to high-dimensional, semantically sparse observations. In the online setting, where agents learn representations while exploring, the latent space evolves with the agent's policy, to capture newly discovered areas of the environment. However, without incentivization to maximize state coverage in the representation, classical approaches based on auto-encoders may converge to latent spaces that over-represent a restricted set of states frequently visited by the agent. This is exacerbated in an intrinsic motivation setting, where the agent uses the distribution encoded in the latent space to sample the goals it learns to master. To address this issue, we propose to progressively enforce distributional shifts towards a uniform distribution over the full state space, to ensure a full coverage of skills that can be learned in the environment. We introduce DRAG (Distributionally Robust Auto-Encoding for GCRL), a method that combines the $\beta$-VAE framework with Distributionally Robust Optimization. DRAG leverages an adversarial neural weighter of training states of the VAE, to account for the mismatch between the current data distribution and unseen parts of the environment. This allows the agent to construct semantically meaningful latent spaces beyond its immediate experience. Our approach improves state space coverage and downstream control performance on hard exploration environments such as mazes and robotic control involving walls to bypass, without pre-training nor prior environment knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemSearcher: Training LLMs to Reason, Search and Manage Memory via End-to-End Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02805v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM context, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts, resulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the current turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This trade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge, we propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact memory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses the user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform search actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for solving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize this workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of MemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of trajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level advantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as Search-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines on seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher even outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance between information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and lower computational overhead.

Existing methods, such as offline or transferable MARL, can ease this burden, but they still rely on costly multi-agent data, which often becomes the bottleneck. In contrast, solo experiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g., collaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock their potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that transfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a shared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation during multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an MoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse cooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency and performance of backbone algorithms. These results demonstrate that solo demonstrations provide a scalable and effective complement to multi-agent data, making cooperative learning more practical and broadly applicable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controlling Performance and Budget of a Centralized Multi-agent LLM System with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02755v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths across domains and come with varying inference costs, motivating the design of multi-agent LLM systems where specialized models collaborate efficiently. Existing approaches predominantly rely on decentralized frameworks, which invoke multiple LLMs for every input and thus lead to substantial and uncontrolled inference costs. In this work, we introduce a centralized multi-LLM framework, where a controller LLM selectively coordinates a pool of expert models in a cost-efficient and cost-controllable manner. We formulate this coordination problem as reinforcement learning with dual objectives: maximizing task performance while minimizing the overall inference cost. In addition, we expect the multi-agent system to have adapted behavior with different budget conditions during inference. To this end, we propose CoRL, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes the performance cost trade-off in a controllable multi-budget setting. Experiments on four diverse benchmarks demonstrate that CoRL enables a single system to surpass the best expert LLM under high-budget settings, while maintaining strong performance in more economical low-budget modes, highlighting the effectiveness of centralized coordination for scalable and cost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Noise-based reward-modulated learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23972v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of energy-efficient and adaptive artificial intelligence (AI) has positioned neuromorphic computing as a promising alternative to conventional computing. However, achieving learning on these platforms requires techniques that prioritize local information while enabling effective credit assignment. Here, we propose noise-based reward-modulated learning (NRL), a novel synaptic plasticity rule that mathematically unifies reinforcement learning and gradient-based optimization with biologically-inspired local updates. NRL addresses the computational bottleneck of exact gradients by approximating them through stochastic neural activity, transforming the inherent noise of biological and neuromorphic substrates into a functional resource. Drawing inspiration from biological learning, our method uses reward prediction errors as its optimization target to generate increasingly advantageous behavior, and eligibility traces to facilitate retrospective credit assignment. Experimental validation on reinforcement tasks, featuring immediate and delayed rewards, shows that NRL achieves performance comparable to baselines optimized using backpropagation, although with slower convergence, while showing significantly superior performance and scalability in multi-layer networks compared to reward-modulated Hebbian learning (RMHL), the most prominent similar approach. While tested on simple architectures, the results highlight the potential of noise-driven, brain-inspired learning for low-power adaptive systems, particularly in computing substrates with locality constraints. NRL offers a theoretically grounded paradigm well-suited for the event-driven characteristics of next-generation neuromorphic AI.</p></details> |  |

While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges. Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo), specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG) consisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes explainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated rationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance, setting a new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.</p></details> | 41 pages, 26 figures |

In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that gradually tightens constraints during training, enabling the agent to incrementally master the deployment requirements. Inspired by self-paced learning techniques in unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL), our approach facilitates a smoother transition to challenging environments by initially training on simplified versions of the constraints and progressively introducing the full deployment conditions. We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a binary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum strategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes the trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large language model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a multi-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks. These results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the efficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory constraints during deployment. Moreover, when applied to LLMs, our strategy enables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens, achieving a substantial inference speedup on consumer hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness for resource-constrained deployment.</p></details> | NeurIPS'25 paper |

However, the explicit reasoning process has yet to show significant benefits for audio question answering, and effectively leveraging deep reasoning remains an open challenge, with LALMs still falling short of human-level auditory-language reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Audio-Thinker, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LALMs, with a focus on improving adaptability, consistency, and effectiveness. Our approach introduces an adaptive think accuracy reward, enabling the model to adjust its reasoning strategies based on task complexity dynamically. Furthermore, we incorporate an external reward model to evaluate the overall consistency and quality of the reasoning process, complemented by think-based rewards that help the model distinguish between valid and flawed reasoning paths during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our Audio-Thinker model outperforms existing reasoning-oriented LALMs across various benchmark tasks, exhibiting superior reasoning and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | preprint |

The focus is on enhancing radar sensing performance in environments with unknown and dynamic disturbance characteristics. A Wald-type detector is employed for robust target detection under non-Gaussian clutter, while a SARSA-based RL algorithm enables adaptive estimation of target positions without prior environmental knowledge. Based on the RL-derived sensing information, a joint waveform optimization strategy is formulated to balance radar sensing accuracy and downlink communication throughput. The resulting design provides an adaptive trade-off between detection performance and achievable sum rate through an analytically derived closed-form solution. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed cognitive ISAC framework achieves significantly improved detection probability compared to orthogonal and non-learning adaptive baselines, while maintaining competitive communication performance. These results underline the potential of RL-assisted sensing for robust and spectrum-efficient ISAC in next-generation wireless networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 14 figures.

However, the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods, often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA (Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate, and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated, interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world environments.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |

Leveraging the Cross-Q algorithm, FRASA significantly reduces training time and offers a versatile recovery strategy that adapts to unpredictable disturbances.

Recent works in Reinforcement Learning (RL) take notably advantage of extensive simulations to produce efficient robot control. State-of-the-art servo actuator models generally fail at capturing the complex friction dynamics of these systems. This limits the transferability of simulated behaviors to real-world applications. In this work, we present extended friction models that allow to more accurately simulate servo actuator dynamics. We propose a comprehensive analysis of various friction models, present a method for identifying model parameters using recorded trajectories from a pendulum test bench, and demonstrate how these models can be integrated into physics engines. The proposed friction models are validated on four distinct servo actuators and tested on 2R manipulators, showing significant improvements in accuracy over the standard Coulomb-Viscous model. Our results highlight the importance of considering advanced friction effects in the simulation of servo actuators to enhance the realism and reliability of robotic simulations.</p></details> |  |

We use it to analyse how optimal stockpile management affects equilibrium prices and the dynamics of demand and supply. We test various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits superior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage operators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price stabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price dynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as volatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices. Remarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained without explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the simulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage thresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market resilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks. For example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more often if a threshold is in place.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, published on</p></details> |

Simulation provides a scalable and systematic alternative, yet existing simulators often fail to capture the coupled visual and physical complexity of soft-body interactions. We present a real-to-sim policy evaluation framework that constructs soft-body digital twins from real-world videos and renders robots, objects, and environments with photorealistic fidelity using 3D Gaussian Splatting. We validate our approach on representative deformable manipulation tasks, including plush toy packing, rope routing, and T-block pushing, demonstrating that simulated rollouts correlate strongly with real-world execution performance and reveal key behavioral patterns of learned policies. Our results suggest that combining physics-informed reconstruction with high-quality rendering enables reproducible, scalable, and accurate evaluation of robotic manipulation policies.

In this setting, speculative decoding can facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: a lightweight on-device model locally generates drafts while a more capable remote target model on a server verifies and corrects them in parallel with speculative sampling, thus resulting in lower latency without compromising accuracy. However, unlike autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for embodied AI applications, cannot parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each generated action depends on observation updated by a previous action. To this end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference (ADAHI), wherein drafts are selectively transmitted and verified based on action deviation, which has a strong correlation with action's rejection probability by the target model. By invoking server operation only when necessary, communication and computational overhead can be reduced while accuracy gain from speculative sampling is preserved. Experiments on our testbed show that ADAHI reduces transmission and server operations by approximately 40%, lowers end-to-end latency by 39.2%, and attains up to 97.2% of the task-success rate of baseline that invokes speculative sampling for every draft embedding vector.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, this paper presents a semantics-guided fuzzy control framework that couples Large Language Models (LLMs) with interpretable control and lightweight coordination. Raw multimodal observations are compressed by the LLM into compact, human-interpretable semantic tokens that summarize obstacles, unexplored regions, and Objects Of Interest (OOIs) under uncertain perception. A fuzzy inference system with pre-defined membership functions then maps these tokens into smooth and stable steering and gait commands, enabling reliable navigation without relying on global positioning. Then, we further coordinate multiple robots by introducing semantic communication that shares intent and local context in linguistic form, enabling agreement on who explores where while avoiding redundant revisits. Extensive simulations in unknown reef-like environments show that, under limited sensing and communication, the proposed framework achieves robust OOI-oriented navigation and cooperative coverage with improved efficiency and adaptability, narrowing the gap between semantic cognition and distributed underwater control in GPS-denied, map-free conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing.

We introduce \textit{ForeRobo}, a generative robotic agent that utilizes generative simulations to autonomously acquire manipulation skills driven by envisioned goal states. Instead of directly learning low-level policies, we advocate integrating generative paradigms with classical control. Our approach equips a robotic agent with a self-guided \textit{propose-generate-learn-actuate} cycle. The agent first proposes the skills to be acquired and constructs the corresponding simulation environments; it then configures objects into appropriate arrangements to generate skill-consistent goal states (\textit{ForeGen}). Subsequently, the virtually infinite data produced by ForeGen are used to train the proposed state generation model (\textit{ForeFormer}), which establishes point-wise correspondences by predicting the 3D goal position of every point in the current state, based on the scene state and task instructions. Finally, classical control algorithms are employed to drive the robot in real-world environments to execute actions based on the envisioned goal states. Compared with end-to-end policy learning methods, ForeFormer offers superior interpretability and execution efficiency. We train and benchmark ForeFormer across a variety of rigid-body and articulated-object manipulation tasks, and observe an average improvement of 56.32\% over the state-of-the-art state generation models, demonstrating strong generality across different manipulation patterns. Moreover, in real-world evaluations involving more than 20 robotic tasks, ForeRobo achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities, attaining an average success rate of 79.28\%.</p></details> |  |

Conventional pipelines have widely relied on RGB-D cameras to provide geometric information, which fail on transparent or glossy objects and degrade at close range. We present GraspView, an RGB-only robotic grasping pipeline that achieves accurate manipulation in cluttered environments without depth sensors. Our framework integrates three key components: (i) global perception scene reconstruction, which provides locally consistent, up-to-scale geometry from a single RGB view and fuses multi-view projections into a coherent global 3D scene; (ii) a render-and-score active perception strategy, which dynamically selects next-best-views to reveal occluded regions; and (iii) an online metric alignment module that calibrates VGGT predictions against robot kinematics to ensure physical scale consistency. Building on these tailor-designed modules, GraspView performs best-view global grasping, fusing multi-view reconstructions and leveraging GraspNet for robust execution. Experiments on diverse tabletop objects demonstrate that GraspView significantly outperforms both RGB-D and single-view RGB baselines, especially under heavy occlusion, near-field sensing, and with transparent objects. These results highlight GraspView as a practical and versatile alternative to RGB-D pipelines, enabling reliable grasping in unstructured real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework combining a Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization Deep Reinforcement Learning framework and a Lightweight Stagnation Detection mechanism. The Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization framework jointly optimizes travel distance and map uncertainty through a dual-objective reward function, balancing exploration and exploitation. The Lightweight Stagnation Detection reduces redundant exploration through Lidar Static Anomaly Detection and Map Update Stagnation Detection, terminating episodes on low expansion rates. Experimental results show that compared with the frontier-based method and RRT method, our approach shortens exploration time by up to 65% and reduces path distance by up to 42%, significantly improving exploration efficiency in complex environments while maintaining reliable map completeness. Ablation studies confirm that the collaborative mechanism accelerates training convergence. Empirical validation on a physical robotic platform demonstrates the algorithm's practical applicability and its successful transferability from simulation to real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

Existing research typically emphasizes human safety or manipulative efficiency, whereas our proposed method uniquely integrates both aspects to strengthen collaboration across diverse conditions (e.g., different grasping postures of humans, and different shapes of objects). Specifically, the joint angles of a simplified human skeleton model are optimized by minimizing the cost function to prioritize safety and manipulative capability. To guide humans towards the optimized posture, the reference end-effector poses of the robot are generated through a transformation module. A bimanual model predictive impedance controller (MPIC) is proposed for our human-like robot, CURI, to recalibrate the end effector poses through planned trajectories. The proposed method has been validated through various subjects and objects during human-human collaboration (HHC) and human-robot collaboration (HRC). The experimental results demonstrate significant improvement in muscle conditions by comparing the activation of target muscles before and after optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, IROS 2025 accepted</p></details> |

However, existing systems typically rely on decoupled modules, resulting in delayed responses and incoherent behaviors in dynamic environments, while real-world perceptual limitations further exacerbate these issues. In this work, we present a unified reinforcement learning-based controller that enables humanoid robots to acquire reactive soccer skills through the direct integration of visual perception and motion control. Our approach extends Adversarial Motion Priors to perceptual settings in real-world dynamic environments, bridging motion imitation and visually grounded dynamic control. We introduce an encoder-decoder architecture combined with a virtual perception system that models real-world visual characteristics, allowing the policy to recover privileged states from imperfect observations and establish active coordination between perception and action. The resulting controller demonstrates strong reactivity, consistently executing coherent and robust soccer behaviors across various scenarios, including real RoboCup matches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://humanoid-kick.github.io</p></details> |

However, most existing models rely solely on RGB cameras, limiting their perception and, consequently, manipulation capabilities. We present OmniVLA, an omni-modality VLA model that integrates novel sensing modalities for physically-grounded spatial intelligence beyond RGB perception. The core of our approach is the sensor-masked image, a unified representation that overlays spatially grounded and physically meaningful masks onto the RGB images, derived from sensors including an infrared camera, a mmWave radar, and a microphone array. This image-native unification keeps sensor input close to RGB statistics to facilitate training, provides a uniform interface across sensor hardware, and enables data-efficient learning with lightweight per-sensor projectors. Built on this, we present a multisensory vision-language-action model architecture and train the model based on an RGB-pretrained VLA backbone. We evaluate OmniVLA on challenging real-world tasks where sensor-modality perception guides the robotic manipulation. OmniVLA achieves an average task success rate of 84%, significantly outperforms both RGB-only and raw-sensor-input baseline models by 59% and 28% respectively, meanwhile showing higher learning efficiency and stronger generalization capability.</p></details> |  |

However, effective dynamic shape control requires a controller that accounts for the robot's high-dimensional dynamics--a challenge exacerbated by a lack of general-purpose tools for modeling soft robots amenably for control. In this work, we conduct a comparative study of data-driven model reduction techniques for generating linear models amendable to dynamic shape control. We focus on three methods--the eigensystem realization algorithm, dynamic mode decomposition with control, and the Lagrangian operator inference (LOpInf) method. Using each class of model, we explored their efficacy in model predictive control policies for the dynamic shape control of a simulated eel-inspired soft robot in three experiments: 1) tracking simulated reference trajectories guaranteed to be feasible, 2) tracking reference trajectories generated from a biological model of eel kinematics, and 3) tracking reference trajectories generated by a reduced-scale physical analog. In all experiments, the LOpInf-based policies generated lower tracking errors than policies based on other models.</p></details> | 20 Pages, 8 Figures |

To support the design optimization and control of such systems, accurate, interpretable, and computationally tractable modeling of the underlying swimming dynamics is indispensable. In this letter, we present a full-body dynamics model for motor-actuated robotic fish, rigorously derived from Hamilton's principle. The model captures the continuously distributed elasticity of a deformable fish body undergoing large deformations and incorporates fluid-structure coupling effects, enabling self-propelled motion without prescribing kinematics. Preliminary open-loop simulations examine how actuation frequency and body stiffness influence the swimming speed and energy efficiency of the robotic fish. Closed-loop simulations further assess how stiffness distribution impacts the controller's velocity-tracking performance and energy efficiency. The results demonstrate the model's potential for performance evaluation and control optimization of soft robotic swimmers when stiffness is treated as a design variable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

However, it remains unclear whether this approach applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic intra-operative spinal navigation.</p></details> |  |

We achieve this improvement in scalability by extending the state-of-the-art Decomposable State Space Hypergraph (DaSH) multi-robot planning framework to support mobile robot motion planning in congested environments. This is a problem that DaSH cannot be directly applied to because it lacks a highly structured, easily discretizable task space and features kinodynamic constraints. We accomplish this by exploiting knowledge about the workspace topology to limit exploration of the planning space and through modifying DaSH's conflict resolution scheme. This guidance captures when coordination between robots is necessary, allowing us to decompose the intractably large multi-robot search space while limiting risk of inter-robot conflicts by composing relevant robot groups together while planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for review</p></details> |

Using the imperfect-information game Geister, we analyzed two types of human piece-moving motions: natural gameplay (unconscious tendencies) and instructed expressions (intentional cues). Based on these findings, we created phase-specific robot motions by varying movement speed and stop duration, and evaluated observer impressions under two presentation modalities: a physical robot and a recorded video. Results indicate that late-phase motion timing, particularly during withdrawal, plays an important role in impression formation and that physical embodiment enhances the interpretability of motion cues. These findings provide insights for designing expressive robot motions based on human timing behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, HAI2025 Workshop on Socially Aware and Cooperative Intelligent Systems</p></details> |

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in training policies for specific autonomous robots, existing frameworks and benchmarks are often constrained to unique platforms, limiting generalization and fair comparisons across different mobility systems. In this paper, we present a multi-domain framework for training, evaluating and deploying RL-based navigation policies across diverse robotic platforms and operational environments. Our work presents four key contributions: (1) a scalable and modular framework, facilitating seamless robot-task interchangeability and reproducible training pipelines; (2) sim-to-real transfer demonstrated through real-world experiments with multiple robots, including a satellite robotic simulator, an unmanned surface vessel, and a wheeled ground vehicle; (3) the release of the first open-source API for deploying Isaac Lab-trained policies to real robots, enabling lightweight inference and rapid field validation; and (4) uniform tasks and metrics for cross-medium evaluation, through a unified evaluation testbed to assess performance of navigation tasks in diverse operational conditions (aquatic, terrestrial and space). By ensuring consistency between simulation and real-world deployment, RoboRAN lowers the barrier to developing adaptable RL-based navigation strategies. Its modular design enables straightforward integration of new robots and tasks through predefined templates, fostering reproducibility and extension to diverse domains. To support the community, we release RoboRAN as open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |

Addressing the dual challenges of maintaining artistic precision and operational reliability under adverse outdoor conditions such as wind and direct sunlight, our work introduces a robust system capable of navigating and painting outdoors with unprecedented accuracy. Key to our approach is a novel navigation system that combines an infrared (IR) motion capture camera and LiDAR technology, enabling precise location tracking tailored specifically for largescale artistic applications. We employ a unique control architecture that uses different regulation in tangential and normal directions relative to the planned path, enabling precise trajectory tracking and stable line rendering. We also present algorithms for trajectory planning and path optimization, allowing for complex curve drawing and area filling. The system includes a custom-designed paint spraying mechanism, specifically engineered to function effectively amidst the turbulent airflow generated by the drone's propellers, which also protects the drone's critical components from paint-related damage, ensuring longevity and consistent performance. Experimental results demonstrate the system's robustness and precision in varied conditions, showcasing its potential for autonomous large-scale art creation and expanding the functional applications of robotics in creative fields.</p></details> |  |

The domain is a simply connected orthogonal polygon with edges parallel to the cartesian coordinate axes. Each robot has a limited sensing capability. We study the problem for both static and mobile intruders. It turns out that the problem of finding an intruder is NP-hard, even for a stationary intruder. Given this intractability, we turn our attention towards developing efficient and robust algorithms, namely methods based on space-filling curves, random search, and cooperative random search. Moreover, for each proposed algorithm, we evaluate the trade-off between the number of search robots and the time required for the robots to complete the search process while considering the geometric properties of the connected orthogonal search area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-User Personalisation in Human-Robot Interaction: Using Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks for Preferences Conflict Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03576v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While personalisation in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has advanced significantly, most existing approaches focus on single-user adaptation, overlooking scenarios involving multiple stakeholders with potentially conflicting preferences. To address this, we propose the Multi-User Preferences Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (MUP-QBAF), a novel multi-user personalisation framework based on Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs) that explicitly models and resolves multi-user preference conflicts. Unlike prior work in Argumentation Frameworks, which typically assumes static inputs, our approach is tailored to robotics: it incorporates both users' arguments and the robot's dynamic observations of the environment, allowing the system to adapt over time and respond to changing contexts. Preferences, both positive and negative, are represented as arguments whose strength is recalculated iteratively based on new information. The framework's properties and capabilities are presented and validated through a realistic case study, where an assistive robot mediates between the conflicting preferences of a caregiver and a care recipient during a frailty assessment task. This evaluation further includes a sensitivity analysis of argument base scores, demonstrating how preference outcomes can be shaped by user input and contextual observations. By offering a transparent, structured, and context-sensitive approach to resolving competing user preferences, this work advances the field of multi-user HRI. It provides a principled alternative to data-driven methods, enabling robots to navigate conflicts in real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to a journal</p></details> |

We present OneOcc, a vision-only panoramic SSC framework designed for gait-introduced body jitter and 360{\deg} continuity. OneOcc combines: (i) Dual-Projection fusion (DP-ER) to exploit the annular panorama and its equirectangular unfolding, preserving 360{\deg} continuity and grid alignment; (ii) Bi-Grid Voxelization (BGV) to reason in Cartesian and cylindrical-polar spaces, reducing discretization bias and sharpening free/occupied boundaries; (iii) a lightweight decoder with Hierarchical AMoE-3D for dynamic multi-scale fusion and better long-range/occlusion reasoning; and (iv) plug-and-play Gait Displacement Compensation (GDC) learning feature-level motion correction without extra sensors. We also release two panoramic occupancy benchmarks: QuadOcc (real quadruped, first-person 360{\deg}) and Human360Occ (H3O) (CARLA human-ego 360{\deg} with RGB, Depth, semantic occupancy; standardized within-/cross-city splits). OneOcc sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA): on QuadOcc it beats strong vision baselines and popular LiDAR ones; on H3O it gains +3.83 mIoU (within-city) and +8.08 (cross-city). Modules are lightweight, enabling deployable full-surround perception for legged/humanoid robots.

Experimental specimens in the life sciences are subject to individual variability and hence require intricate algorithms for successful autonomous robotic control. As a use case, we are studying the cranial window creation in mice. This operation requires the removal of an 8-mm circular patch of the skull, which is approximately 300 um thick, but the shape and thickness of the mouse skull significantly varies depending on the strain of the mouse, sex, and age. In this work, we develop an autonomous robotic drilling system with no offline planning, consisting of a trajectory planner with execution-time feedback with drilling completion level recognition based on image and force information. In the experiments, we first evaluate the image-and-force-based drilling completion level recognition by comparing it with other state-of-the-art deep learning image processing methods and conduct an ablation study in eggshell drilling to evaluate the impact of each module on system performance. Finally, the system performance is further evaluated in postmortem mice, achieving a success rate of 70% (14/20 trials) with an average drilling time of 9.3 min.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures, accepted on T-ASE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Indicating Robot Vision Capabilities with Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03550v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research indicates that humans can mistakenly assume that robots and humans have the same field of view (FoV), possessing an inaccurate mental model of robots. This misperception may lead to failures during human-robot collaboration tasks where robots might be asked to complete impossible tasks about out-of-view objects. The issue is more severe when robots do not have a chance to scan the scene to update their world model while focusing on assigned tasks. To help align humans' mental models of robots' vision capabilities, we propose four FoV indicators in augmented reality (AR) and conducted a user human-subjects experiment (N=41) to evaluate them in terms of accuracy, confidence, task efficiency, and workload. These indicators span a spectrum from egocentric (robot's eye and head space) to allocentric (task space). Results showed that the allocentric blocks at the task space had the highest accuracy with a delay in interpreting the robot's FoV. The egocentric indicator of deeper eye sockets, possible for physical alteration, also increased accuracy. In all indicators, participants' confidence was high while cognitive load remained low. Finally, we contribute six guidelines for practitioners to apply our AR indicators or physical alterations to align humans' mental models with robots' vision capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROSBag MCP Server: Analyzing Robot Data with LLMs for Agentic Embodied AI Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03497v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key research verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, with Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and enabler of agentic applications. However, the literature at the intersection of these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through LLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time series data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2 CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source (through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both proprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools available to the models.

| **[Value Elicitation for a Socially Assistive Robot Addressing Social Anxiety: A Participatory Design Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03444v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social anxiety is a prevalent mental health condition that can significantly impact overall well-being and quality of life. Despite its widespread effects, adequate support or treatment for social anxiety is often insufficient. Advances in technology, particularly in social robotics, offer promising opportunities to complement traditional mental health. As an initial step toward developing effective solutions, it is essential to understand the values that shape what is considered meaningful, acceptable, and helpful. In this study, a participatory design workshop was conducted with mental health academic researchers to elicit the underlying values that should inform the design of socially assistive robots for social anxiety support. Through creative, reflective, and envisioning activities, participants explored scenarios and design possibilities, allowing for systematic elicitation of values, expectations, needs, and preferences related to robot-supported interventions. The findings reveal rich insights into design-relevant values-including adaptivity, acceptance, and efficacy-that are core to support for individuals with social anxiety. This study highlights the significance of a research-led approach to value elicitation, emphasising user-centred and context-aware design considerations in the development of socially assistive robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Value Engineering in AI (VALE) Workshop (ECAI 2025)</p></details> |

In contrast, traditional rigid robots offer high accuracy and repeatability but lack the flexibility of soft robots. We argue that combining these characteristics in a hybrid robotic platform can significantly enhance overall capabilities. This work presents a novel hybrid robotic platform that integrates a rigid manipulator with a fully developed soft arm. This system is equipped with the intelligence necessary to perform flexible and generalizable tasks through imitation learning autonomously. The physical softness and machine learning enable our platform to achieve highly generalizable skills, while the rigid components ensure precision and repeatability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update with additional results and experiments</p></details> |
| **[GUIDES: Guidance Using Instructor-Distilled Embeddings for Pre-trained Robot Policy Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03400v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained robot policies serve as the foundation of many validated robotic systems, which encapsulate extensive embodied knowledge. However, they often lack the semantic awareness characteristic of foundation models, and replacing them entirely is impractical in many situations due to high costs and the loss of accumulated knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce GUIDES, a lightweight framework that augments pre-trained policies with semantic guidance from foundation models without requiring architectural redesign. GUIDES employs a fine-tuned vision-language model (Instructor) to generate contextual instructions, which are encoded by an auxiliary module into guidance embeddings. These embeddings are injected into the policy's latent space, allowing the legacy model to adapt to this new semantic input through brief, targeted fine-tuning. For inference-time robustness, a large language model-based Reflector monitors the Instructor's confidence and, when confidence is low, initiates a reasoning loop that analyzes execution history, retrieves relevant examples, and augments the VLM's context to refine subsequent actions. Extensive validation in the RoboCasa simulation environment across diverse policy architectures shows consistent and substantial improvements in task success rates. Real-world deployment on a UR5 robot further demonstrates that GUIDES enhances motion precision for critical sub-tasks such as grasping. Overall, GUIDES offers a practical and resource-efficient pathway to upgrade, rather than replace, validated robot policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, Accepted by IEEE IROS 2025 Workshop WIR-M</p></details> |
| **[Augmented Reality for RObots (ARRO): Pointing Visuomotor Policies Towards Visual Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08627v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visuomotor policies trained on human expert demonstrations have recently shown strong performance across a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks. However, these policies remain highly sensitive to domain shifts stemming from background or robot embodiment changes, which limits their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we present ARRO, a novel visual representation that leverages zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation and object detection models to efficiently mask out task-irrelevant regions of the scene in real time without requiring additional training, modeling of the setup, or camera calibration. By filtering visual distractors and overlaying virtual guides during both training and inference, ARRO improves robustness to scene variations and reduces the need for additional data collection. We extensively evaluate ARRO with Diffusion Policy on a range of tabletop manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments, and further demonstrate its compatibility and effectiveness with generalist robot policies, such as Octo and OpenVLA. Across all settings in our evaluation, ARRO yields consistent performance gains, allows for selective masking to choose between different objects, and shows robustness even to challenging segmentation conditions.

| **[Collaborative Assembly Policy Learning of a Sightless Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03189v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores a physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) task involving the joint insertion of a board into a frame by a sightless robot and a human operator. While admittance control is commonly used in pHRC tasks, it can be challenging to measure the force/torque applied by the human for accurate human intent estimation, limiting the robot's ability to assist in the collaborative task. Other methods that attempt to solve pHRC tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) are also unsuitable for the board-insertion task due to its safety constraints and sparse rewards. Therefore, we propose a novel RL approach that utilizes a human-designed admittance controller to facilitate more active robot behavior and reduce human effort. Through simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms admittance control in terms of success rate and task completion time. Additionally, we observed a significant reduction in measured force/torque when using our proposed approach compared to admittance control.

| **[Learning-based Cooperative Robotic Paper Wrapping: A Unified Control Policy with Residual Force Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03181v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-robot cooperation is essential in environments such as warehouses and retail stores, where workers frequently handle deformable objects like paper, bags, and fabrics. Coordinating robotic actions with human assistance remains difficult due to the unpredictable dynamics of deformable materials and the need for adaptive force control. To explore this challenge, we focus on the task of gift wrapping, which exemplifies a long-horizon manipulation problem involving precise folding, controlled creasing, and secure fixation of paper. Success is achieved when the robot completes the sequence to produce a neatly wrapped package with clean folds and no tears. We propose a learning-based framework that integrates a high-level task planner powered by a large language model (LLM) with a low-level hybrid imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) policy. At its core is a Sub-task Aware Robotic Transformer (START) that learns a unified policy from human demonstrations. The key novelty lies in capturing long-range temporal dependencies across the full wrapping sequence within a single model. Unlike vanilla Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT), typically applied to short tasks, our method introduces sub-task IDs that provide explicit temporal grounding. This enables robust performance across the entire wrapping process and supports flexible execution, as the policy learns sub-goals rather than merely replicating motion sequences. Our framework achieves a 97% success rate on real-world wrapping tasks. We show that the unified transformer-based policy reduces the need for specialized models, allows controlled human supervision, and effectively bridges high-level intent with the fine-grained force control required for deformable object manipulation.</p></details> |  |

The motion planning of this system faces challenges due to the interactions between the cable's state transitions, the trailer's nonholonomic constraints, and the system's underactuation. To address these challenges, we first develop a hybrid dynamics model that captures the cable's taut and slack states. A search algorithm is then introduced to compute a suboptimal trajectory while incorporating mode transitions. Additionally, we propose a novel collision avoidance constraint based on geometric polygons to formulate the trajectory optimization problem for the hybrid system. The proposed method is implemented on a Unitree A1 quadruped robot with a customized cable-trailer and validated through experiments. The real system demonstrates both agile and safe motion with cable mode transitions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, Accept by RA-L 2025</p></details> |

We introduce AURA (Autonomous Resilience Agent), a collaborative framework for anomaly and fault diagnostics in robotics. AURA integrates large language models (LLMs), a high-fidelity digital twin (DT), and human-in-the-loop interaction to detect and respond to anomalous behavior in real time. The architecture uses two agents with clear roles: (i) a low-level State Anomaly Characterization Agent that monitors telemetry and converts signals into a structured natural-language problem description, and (ii) a high-level Diagnostic Reasoning Agent that conducts a knowledge-grounded dialogue with an operator to identify root causes, drawing on external sources. Human-validated diagnoses are then converted into new training examples that refine the low-level perceptual model. This feedback loop progressively distills expert knowledge into the AI, transforming it from a static tool into an adaptive partner. We describe the framework's operating principles and provide a concrete implementation, establishing a pattern for trustworthy, continually improving human-robot teams.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper was submitted for ICRA 2026</p></details> |

Despite its outstanding results on diverse material objects, a typical MVPS experimental setup requires a well-calibrated light source and a monocular camera installed on an immovable base. This restricts the use of MVPS on a movable platform, limiting us from taking MVPS benefits in 3D acquisition for mobile robotics applications. To this end, we introduce a new mobile robotic system for MVPS. While the proposed system brings advantages, it introduces additional algorithmic challenges. Addressing them, in this paper, we further propose an incremental approach for mobile robotic MVPS. Our approach leverages a supervised learning setup to predict per-view surface normal, object depth, and per-pixel uncertainty in model-predicted results. A refined depth map per view is obtained by solving an MVPS-driven optimization problem proposed in this paper. Later, we fuse the refined depth map while tracking the camera pose w.r.t the reference frame to recover globally consistent object 3D geometry. Experimental results show the advantages of our robotic system and algorithm, featuring the local high-frequency surface detail recovery with globally consistent object shape. Our work is beyond any MVPS system yet presented, providing encouraging results on objects with unknown reflectance properties using fewer frames without a tiring calibration and installation process, enabling computationally efficient robotic automation approach to photogrammetry. The proposed approach is nearly 100 times computationally faster than the state-of-the-art MVPS methods such as [1, 2] while maintaining the similar results when tested on subjects taken from the benchmark DiLiGenT MV dataset [3].</p></details> | <details><summary>Ackno...</summary><p>Acknowledgment Added.

Bimanual robotic piano playing represents a particularly challenging task: it is high-dimensional, contact-rich, and requires fast, precise control. We present OmniPianist, the first agent capable of performing nearly one thousand music pieces via scalable, human-demonstration-free learning. Our approach is built on three core components. First, we introduce an automatic fingering strategy based on Optimal Transport (OT), allowing the agent to autonomously discover efficient piano-playing strategies from scratch without demonstrations. Second, we conduct large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) by training more than 2,000 agents, each specialized in distinct music pieces, and aggregate their experience into a dataset named RP1M++, consisting of over one million trajectories for robotic piano playing. Finally, we employ a Flow Matching Transformer to leverage RP1M++ through large-scale imitation learning, resulting in the OmniPianist agent capable of performing a wide range of musical pieces. Extensive experiments and ablation studies highlight the effectiveness and scalability of our approach, advancing dexterous robotic piano playing at scale.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in these areas in recent years, enabling domain-specific applications as well as zero-shot open vocabulary tasks, combining multiple domains. However, the required computational complexity poses challenges for their application on edge devices and in the context of Mobile Robotics, especially considering the trade-off between accuracy and inference time. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of state-of-the-art VLMs for the task of Scene Interpretation and Action Recognition, with special regard to small VLMs capable of being deployed to edge devices in the context of Mobile Robotics. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on a diverse dataset consisting of various real-world cityscape, on-campus and indoor scenarios.

To leverage knowledge from large-scale pretraining, prior work (VLA) has typically built generalist policies either on top of vision-language understanding models (VLMs) or generative models. However, both semantic understanding from vision-language pretraining and visual dynamics modeling from visual-generation pretraining are crucial for embodied robots. Recent unified models of generation and understanding have demonstrated strong capabilities in both comprehension and generation through large-scale pretraining. We posit that robotic policy learning can likewise benefit from the combined strengths of understanding, planning, and continuous future representation learning. Building on this insight, we introduce UniCoD, which acquires the ability to dynamically model high-dimensional visual features through pretraining on over 1M internet-scale instructional manipulation videos. Subsequently, UniCoD is fine-tuned on data collected from the robot embodiment, enabling the learning of mappings from predictive representations to action tokens.

In this paper, we propose a unified framework for robot-assisted drone recovery on a wavy surface that addresses two major tasks: Firstly, accurate prediction of a moving drone's position under wave-induced disturbances using KalmanNet Plus Plus (KalmanNet++), a Neural Network Aided Kalman Filtering we proposed. Secondly, effective motion planning using the desired position we got for a manipulator via Receding Horizon Model Predictive Control (RHMPC). Specifically, we compared multiple prediction methods and proposed KalmanNet Plus Plus to predict the position of the UAV, thereby obtaining the desired position. The KalmanNet++ predicts the drone's future position 0.1\,s ahead, while the manipulator plans a capture trajectory in real time, thus overcoming not only wave-induced base motions but also limited constraints such as torque constraints and joint constraints. For the system design, we provide a collaborative system, comprising a manipulator subsystem and a UAV subsystem, enables drone lifting and drone recovery. Simulation and real-world experiments using wave-disturbed motion data demonstrate that our approach achieves a high success rate - above 95\% and outperforms conventional baseline methods by up to 10\% in efficiency and 20\% in precision. The results underscore the feasibility and robustness of our system, which achieves state-of-the-art performance and offers a practical solution for maritime drone operations.</p></details> | 17 pages, 51 figures |
| **[LACY: A Vision-Language Model-based Language-Action Cycle for Self-Improving Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02239v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning generalizable policies for robotic manipulation increasingly relies on large-scale models that map language instructions to actions (L2A). However, this one-way paradigm often produces policies that execute tasks without deeper contextual understanding, limiting their ability to generalize or explain their behavior. We argue that the complementary skill of mapping actions back to language (A2L) is essential for developing more holistic grounding. An agent capable of both acting and explaining its actions can form richer internal representations and unlock new paradigms for self-supervised learning. We introduce LACY (Language-Action Cycle), a unified framework that learns such bidirectional mappings within a single vision-language model. LACY is jointly trained on three synergistic tasks: generating parameterized actions from language (L2A), explaining observed actions in language (A2L), and verifying semantic consistency between two language descriptions (L2C). This enables a self-improving cycle that autonomously generates and filters new training data through an active augmentation strategy targeting low-confidence cases, thereby improving the model without additional human labels. Experiments on pick-and-place tasks in both simulation and the real world show that LACY improves task success rates by 56.46% on average and yields more robust language-action grounding for robotic manipulation.

| **[Rethinking Bimanual Robotic Manipulation: Learning with Decoupled Interaction Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09186v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bimanual robotic manipulation is an emerging and critical topic in the robotics community. Previous works primarily rely on integrated control models that take the perceptions and states of both arms as inputs to directly predict their actions. However, we think bimanual manipulation involves not only coordinated tasks but also various uncoordinated tasks that do not require explicit cooperation during execution, such as grasping objects with the closest hand, which integrated control frameworks ignore to consider due to their enforced cooperation in the early inputs. In this paper, we propose a novel decoupled interaction framework that considers the characteristics of different tasks in bimanual manipulation. The key insight of our framework is to assign an independent model to each arm to enhance the learning of uncoordinated tasks, while introducing a selective interaction module that adaptively learns weights from its own arm to improve the learning of coordinated tasks. Extensive experiments on seven tasks in the RoboTwin dataset demonstrate that: (1) Our framework achieves outstanding performance, with a 23.5% boost over the SOTA method. (2) Our framework is flexible and can be seamlessly integrated into existing methods. (3) Our framework can be effectively extended to multi-agent manipulation tasks, achieving a 28% boost over the integrated control SOTA. (4) The performance boost stems from the decoupled design itself, surpassing the SOTA by 16.5% in success rate with only 1/6 of the model size.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |
| **[RoboTron-Mani: All-in-One Multimodal Large Model for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07215v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, robotics has advanced significantly through the integration of larger models and large-scale datasets. However, challenges remain in applying these models to 3D spatial interactions and managing data collection costs. To address these issues, we propose the multimodal robotic manipulation model RoboTron-Mani and the comprehensive dataset RoboData. RoboTron-Mani, on one hand, enhances 3D perception through camera parameters and occupancy supervision. On the other hand, it further incorporates Modality-Isolation-Mask and multimodal decoder blocks based on OpenFlamingo, improving modality fusion and fine-grained perception. RoboData integrats several publicly-available datasets, achieving the first fusion of multi-view images, camera parameters, depth maps, actions, and space alignment, which facilitates comprehensive learning from diverse robotic datasets and offers one complete evaluation system. Trained on RoboData, RoboTron-Mani is the first generalist policy that surpasses expert models, enabling simultaneous evaluation of all tasks across multiple datasets, rather than being limited to specific data or task selections. Specifically, RoboTron-Mani boosts manipulation performance by increasing the average sequence length on CALVIN from 1.7 to 3.5, enabling cross-embodiment generalization, and achieving state-of-the-art results on both simulated and real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Quantitative Comparison of Centralised and Distributed Reinforcement Learning-Based Control for Soft Robotic Arms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02192v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a quantitative comparison between centralised and distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) architectures for controlling a soft robotic arm modelled as a Cosserat rod in simulation. Using PyElastica and the OpenAI Gym interface, we train both a global Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) controller and a Multi-Agent PPO (MAPPO) under identical budgets. Both approaches are based on the arm having $n$ number of controlled sections. The study systematically varies $n$ and evaluates the performance of the arm to reach a fixed target in three scenarios: default baseline condition, recovery from external disturbance, and adaptation to actuator failure. Quantitative metrics used for the evaluation are mean action magnitude, mean final distance, mean episode length, and success rate. The results show that there are no significant benefits of the distributed policy when the number of controlled sections $n\le4$. In very simple systems, when $n\le2$, the centralised policy outperforms the distributed one. When $n$ increases to $4< n\le 12$, the distributed policy shows a high sample efficiency. In these systems, distributed policy promotes a stronger success rate, resilience, and robustness under local observability and yields faster convergence given the same sample size. However, centralised policies achieve much higher time efficiency during training as it takes much less time to train the same size of samples. These findings highlight the trade-offs between centralised and distributed policy in reinforcement learning-based control for soft robotic systems and provide actionable design guidance for future sim-to-real transfer in soft rod-like manipulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, submitted to RoboSoft 2026</p></details> |
| **[Kinematic and Ergonomic Design of a Robotic Arm for Precision Laparoscopic Surgery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02167v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic assistance in minimally invasive surgery can greatly enhance surgical precision and reduce surgeon fatigue. This paper presents a focused investigation on the kinematic and ergonomic design principles for a laparoscopic surgical robotic arm aimed at high-precision tasks. We propose a 7-degree-of-freedom (7-DOF) robotic arm system that incorporates a remote center of motion (RCM) at the instrument insertion point and ergonomic considerations to improve surgeon interaction. The design is implemented on a general-purpose robotic platform, and a series of simulated surgical tasks were performed to evaluate targeting accuracy, task efficiency, and surgeon comfort compared to conventional manual laparoscopy. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized robotic design achieves significantly improved targeting accuracy (error reduced by over 50%) and shorter task completion times, while substantially lowering operator muscle strain and discomfort. These findings validate the importance of kinematic optimization (such as added articulations and tremor filtering) and human-centered ergonomic design in enhancing the performance of robot-assisted surgery. The insights from this work can guide the development of next-generation surgical robots that improve surgical outcomes and ergonomics for the operating team.</p></details> |  |

We present a pipeline that integrates 3D generative AI with vision-language models (VLMs) to enable the robotic assembly of multi-component objects from natural language. Our method leverages VLMs for zero-shot, multi-modal reasoning about geometry and functionality to decompose AI-generated meshes into multi-component 3D models using predefined structural and panel components. We demonstrate that a VLM is capable of determining which mesh regions need panel components in addition to structural components, based on object functionality. Evaluation across test objects shows that users preferred the VLM-generated assignments 90.6% of the time, compared to 59.4% for rule-based and 2.5% for random assignment. Lastly, the system allows users to refine component assignments through conversational feedback, enabling greater human control and agency in making physical objects with generative AI and robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025, Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, Creative AI Track</p></details> |
| **[Census-Based Population Autonomy For Distributed Robotic Teaming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02147v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborating teams of robots show promise due in their ability to complete missions more efficiently and with improved robustness, attributes that are particularly useful for systems operating in marine environments. A key issue is how to model, analyze, and design these multi-robot systems to realize the full benefits of collaboration, a challenging task since the domain of multi-robot autonomy encompasses both collective and individual behaviors. This paper introduces a layered model of multi-robot autonomy that uses the principle of census, or a weighted count of the inputs from neighbors, for collective decision-making about teaming, coupled with multi-objective behavior optimization for individual decision-making about actions. The census component is expressed as a nonlinear opinion dynamics model and the multi-objective behavior optimization is accomplished using interval programming. This model can be reduced to recover foundational algorithms in distributed optimization and control, while the full model enables new types of collective behaviors that are useful in real-world scenarios. To illustrate these points, a new method for distributed optimization of subgroup allocation is introduced where robots use a gradient descent algorithm to minimize portions of the cost functions that are locally known, while being influenced by the opinion states from neighbors to account for the unobserved costs. With this method the group can collectively use the information contained in the Hessian matrix of the total global cost. The utility of this model is experimentally validated in three categorically different experiments with fleets of autonomous surface vehicles: an adaptive sampling scenario, a high value unit protection scenario, and a competitive game of capture the flag.</p></details> | 16 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Integrated Shape-Force Estimation for Continuum Robots: A Virtual-Work and Polynomial-Curvature Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05418v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cable-driven continuum robots (CDCRs) are widely used in surgical and inspection tasks that require dexterous manipulation in confined spaces. Existing model-based estimation methods either assume constant curvature or rely on geometry-space interpolants, both of which struggle with accuracy under large deformations and sparse sensing. This letter introduces an integrated shape-force estimation framework that combines cable-tension measurements with tip-pose data to reconstruct backbone shape and estimate external tip force simultaneously. The framework employs polynomial curvature kinematics (PCK) and a virtual-work-based static formulation expressed directly in curvature space, where polynomial modal coefficients serve as generalized coordinates. The proposed method is validated through Cosserat-rod-based simulations and hardware experiments on a torque-cell-enabled CDCR prototype. Results show that the second-order PCK model achieves superior shape and force accuracy, combining a lightweight shape optimization with a closed-form, iteration-free force estimation, offering a compact and robust alternative to prior constant-curvature and geometry-space approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robotic Monitoring of Colorimetric Leaf Sensors for Precision Agriculture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13916v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Common remote sensing modalities (RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral imaging or LiDAR) are often used to indirectly measure crop health and do not directly capture plant stress indicators. Commercially available direct leaf sensors are bulky, powered electronics that are expensive and interfere with crop growth. In contrast, low-cost, passive and bio-degradable leaf sensors offer an opportunity to advance real-time monitoring as they directly interface with the crop surface while not interfering with crop growth. To this end, we co-design a sensor-detector system, where the sensor is a passive colorimetric leaf sensor that directly measures crop health in a precision agriculture setting, and the detector autonomously obtains optical signals from these leaf sensors. The detector comprises a low size weight and power (SWaP) mobile ground robot with an onboard monocular RGB camera and object detector to localize each leaf sensor, as well as a hyperspectral camera with a motorized mirror and halogen light to acquire hyperspectral images. The sensor's crop health-dependent optical signals can be extracted from the hyperspectral images. The proof-of-concept system is demonstrated in row-crop environments both indoors and outdoors where it is able to autonomously navigate, locate and obtain a hyperspectral image of all leaf sensors present, and acquire interpretable spectral resonance with 80 $\%$ accuracy within a required retrieval distance from the sensor.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version.

CSI readings are converted into synthetic images using the TINTO tool. The localisation solution is integrated with a robotics simulator, and the Robot Operating System (ROS), which facilitates its evaluation through heterogeneous test cases, and the adoption of state estimators like Kalman filters. Our contributions illustrate the potential of our HyNN model in achieving precise indoor localisation and navigation for mobile robots in complex environments.

However, this introduces two challenges: (1) cable interference significantly reduces the rotational workspace, and (2) the solution of tensions in cables becomes non-unique, resulting in difficulties for kinematic control of the robot. In this work, we design structurally simple reconfigurable end-effectors for cable robots. By incorporating a spring, a helical-grooved shaft, and a matching nut, relative linear motions between end-effector components are converted into relative rotations, thereby expanding the rotational workspace of the mechanism. Meanwhile, a bearing is introduced to provide an additional rotational degree of freedom, making the mechanism non-redundant. As a result, the robot's motion can be controlled purely through kinematics without additional tension sensing and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, Technical Report</p></details> |

| **[Lightweight Learning from Actuation-Space Demonstrations via Flow Matching for Whole-Body Soft Robotic Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01770v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic grasping under uncertainty remains a fundamental challenge due to its uncertain and contact-rich nature. Traditional rigid robotic hands, with limited degrees of freedom and compliance, rely on complex model-based and heavy feedback controllers to manage such interactions. Soft robots, by contrast, exhibit embodied mechanical intelligence: their underactuated structures and passive flexibility of their whole body, naturally accommodate uncertain contacts and enable adaptive behaviors. To harness this capability, we propose a lightweight actuation-space learning framework that infers distributional control representations for whole-body soft robotic grasping, directly from deterministic demonstrations using a flow matching model (Rectified Flow),without requiring dense sensing or heavy control loops. Using only 30 demonstrations (less than 8% of the reachable workspace), the learned policy achieves a 97.5% grasp success rate across the whole workspace, generalizes to grasped-object size variations of +-33%, and maintains stable performance when the robot's dynamic response is directly adjusted by scaling the execution time from 20% to 200%. These results demonstrate that actuation-space learning, by leveraging its passive redundant DOFs and flexibility, converts the body's mechanics into functional control intelligence and substantially reduces the burden on central controllers for this uncertain-rich task.</p></details> |  |

However, evaluating these policies directly on physical robotic platforms such as the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) remains hindered by high costs, time demands, reproducibility challenges, and variability in execution. World foundation models (WFM) for physical AI offer a transformative approach to simulate complex real-world surgical tasks, such as soft tissue deformation, with high fidelity. This work introduces Cosmos-Surg-dVRK, a surgical finetune of the Cosmos WFM, which, together with a trained video classifier, enables fully automated online evaluation and benchmarking of surgical policies. We evaluate Cosmos-Surg-dVRK using two distinct surgical datasets. On tabletop suture pad tasks, the automated pipeline achieves strong correlation between online rollouts in Cosmos-Surg-dVRK and policy outcomes on the real dVRK Si platform, as well as good agreement between human labelers and the V-JEPA 2-derived video classifier. Additionally, preliminary experiments with ex-vivo porcine cholecystectomy tasks in Cosmos-Surg-dVRK demonstrate promising alignment with real-world evaluations, highlighting the platform's potential for more complex surgical procedures.</p></details> | <details><summary>minor...</summary><p>minor metadata and notation fixes; +3 citations</p></details> |

Exploring the Role of Robots' Value Awareness in a Decision-Making Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23204v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates whether the opinions of robotic agents can influence human decision-making when robots display value awareness (i.e., the capability of understanding human preferences and prioritizing them in decision-making). We designed an experiment in which participants interacted with two Furhat robots - one programmed to be Value-Aware and the other Non-Value-Aware - during a labeling task for images representing human values. Results indicate that participants distinguished the Value-Aware robot from the Non-Value-Aware one. Although their explicit choices did not indicate a clear preference for one robot over the other, participants directed their gaze more toward the Value-Aware robot. Additionally, the Value-Aware robot was perceived as more loyal, suggesting that value awareness in a social robot may enhance its perceived commitment to the group. Finally, when both robots disagreed with the participant, conformity occurred in about one out of four trials, and participants took longer to confirm their responses, suggesting that two robots expressing dissent may introduce hesitation in decision-making. On one hand, this highlights the potential risk that robots, if misused, could manipulate users for unethical purposes. On the other hand, it reinforces the idea that social robots could encourage reflection in ambiguous situations and help users avoid scams.</p></details> | Pre-print version |

We present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning training framework built on diffusion visuomotor policies trained by supervised learning. RL-100 introduces a three-stage pipeline. First, imitation learning leverages human priors. Second, iterative offline reinforcement learning uses an Offline Policy Evaluation procedure, abbreviated OPE, to gate PPO-style updates that are applied in the denoising process for conservative and reliable improvement. Third, online reinforcement learning eliminates residual failure modes. An additional lightweight consistency distillation head compresses the multi-step sampling process in diffusion into a single-step policy, enabling high-frequency control with an order-of-magnitude reduction in latency while preserving task performance. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and representation-agnostic and supports both 3D point clouds and 2D RGB inputs, a variety of robot platforms, and both single-step and action-chunk policies. We evaluate RL-100 on seven real-robot tasks spanning dynamic rigid-body control, such as Push-T and Agile Bowling, fluids and granular pouring, deformable cloth folding, precise dexterous unscrewing, and multi-stage orange juicing. RL-100 attains 100\% success across evaluated trials for a total of 900 out of 900 episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task. The method achieves near-human teleoperation or better time efficiency and demonstrates multi-hour robustness with uninterrupted operation lasting up to two hours.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://lei-kun.github.io/RL-100/</p></details> |

We introduce MARS - a Multi-Agent Robotic System powered by MLLMs for assistive intelligence and designed for smart home robots supporting people with disabilities. The system integrates four agents: a visual perception agent for extracting semantic and spatial features from environment images, a risk assessment agent for identifying and prioritizing hazards, a planning agent for generating executable action sequences, and an evaluation agent for iterative optimization. By combining multimodal perception with hierarchical multi-agent decision-making, the framework enables adaptive, risk-aware, and personalized assistance in dynamic indoor environments. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior overall performance of the proposed system in risk-aware planning and coordinated multi-agent execution compared with state-of-the-art multimodal models. The proposed approach also highlights the potential of collaborative AI for practical assistive scenarios and provides a generalizable methodology for deploying MLLM-enabled multi-agent systems in real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 fig...</summary><p>3 figures, 1 table; under review at Multimedia Systems (Springer)</p></details> |
| **[SE(3)-PoseFlow: Estimating 6D Pose Distributions for Uncertainty-Aware Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01501v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object pose estimation is a fundamental problem in robotics and computer vision, yet it remains challenging due to partial observability, occlusions, and object symmetries, which inevitably lead to pose ambiguity and multiple hypotheses consistent with the same observation. While deterministic deep networks achieve impressive performance under well-constrained conditions, they are often overconfident and fail to capture the multi-modality of the underlying pose distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel probabilistic framework that leverages flow matching on the SE(3) manifold for estimating 6D object pose distributions. Unlike existing methods that regress a single deterministic output, our approach models the full pose distribution with a sample-based estimate and enables reasoning about uncertainty in ambiguous cases such as symmetric objects or severe occlusions. We achieve state-of-the-art results on Real275, YCB-V, and LM-O, and demonstrate how our sample-based pose estimates can be leveraged in downstream robotic manipulation tasks such as active perception for disambiguating uncertain viewpoints or guiding grasp synthesis in an uncertainty-aware manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[VO-DP: Semantic-Geometric Adaptive Diffusion Policy for Vision-Only Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15530v4)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of imitation learning, visuomotor-based diffusion policy learning is one of the main directions in robotic manipulation. Most of these approaches rely on point clouds as observation inputs and construct scene representations through point clouds feature learning, which enables them to achieve remarkable accuracy. However, the existing literature lacks an in-depth exploration of vision-only solutions that have significant potential. In this paper, we propose a Vision-Only and single-view Diffusion Policy learning method (VO-DP) that leverages pretrained visual foundation models to achieve effective fusion of semantic and geometric features. We utilize intermediate features from VGGT incorporating semantic features from DINOv2 and geometric features from Alternating Attention blocks. Features are fused via cross-attention and spatially compressed with a CNN to form the input to the policy head. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VO-DP not only outperforms the vision-only baseline DP significantly but also exhibits distinct performance trends against the point cloud-based method DP3: in simulation tasks, VO-DP achieves an average success rate of 64.6% on par with DP3 64.0% and far higher than DP 34.8%, while in real-world tasks, it reaches 87.9%, outperforming both DP3 67.5% and DP 11.2% by a notable margin. Further robustness evaluations confirm that VO-DP remains highly stable under varying conditions including color, size, background, and lighting. Lastly, we open-source a training library for robotic manipulation. Built on Accelerate, this library supports multi-machine and multi-GPU parallel training, as well as mixed precision training. It is compatible with visuomotor policies such as DP, DP3 and VO-DP, and also supports the RoboTwin simulator.</p></details> |  |

Among bioinspired designs, earthworm locomotion has been extensively studied for its efficient peristaltic motion, enabling movement in confined and unstructured environments. Existing earthworm-inspired robots primarily utilize pneumatic actuation due to its high force-to-weight ratio and ease of implementation. However, these systems often rely on bulky, power-intensive electronic control units, limiting their practicality. In this work, we present an electronics-free, earthworm-inspired pneumatic robot utilizing a modified Pneumatic Logic Gate (PLG) design. By integrating preconfigured PLG units with bellow actuators, we achieved a plug-and-play style modular system capable of peristaltic locomotion without external electronic components. The proposed design reduces system complexity while maintaining efficient actuation. We characterize the bellow actuators under different operating conditions and evaluate the robots locomotion performance. Our findings demonstrate that the modified PLG-based control system effectively generates peristaltic wave propagation, achieving autonomous motion with minimal deviation. This study serves as a proof of concept for the development of electronics-free, peristaltic soft robots. The proposed system has potential for applications in hazardous environments, where untethered, adaptable locomotion is critical. Future work will focus on further optimizing the robot design and exploring untethered operation using onboard compressed air sources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference Proceedings Paper Living Machines 2025</p></details> |

However, achieving both structural integrity and compliance for comfort remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a novel fabrication and design method that combines the advantages of origami structures with the material programmability and wearability of knitted fabrics. We introduce a general design method that translates origami patterns into knit designs by programming both stitch and material patterns. The method creates folds in preferred directions while suppressing unintended buckling and bending by selectively incorporating heat fusible yarn to create rigid panels around compliant creases. We experimentally quantify folding moments and show that stitch patterning enhances folding directionality while the heat fusible yarn (1) keeps geometry consistent by reducing edge curl and (2) prevents out-of-plane deformations by stiffening panels. We demonstrate the framework through the successful reproduction of complex origami tessellations, including Miura-ori, Yoshimura, and Kresling patterns, and present a wearable knitted Kaleidocycle robot capable of locomotion. The combination of structural reconfigurability, material programmability, and potential for manufacturing scalability highlights knitted origami as a promising platform for next-generation wearable robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Don't Just Search, Understand: Semantic Path Planning Agent for Spherical Tensegrity Robots in Unknown Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01236v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Endowed with inherent dynamical properties that grant them remarkable ruggedness and adaptability, spherical tensegrity robots stand as prototypical examples of hybrid softrigid designs and excellent mobile platforms. However, path planning for these robots in unknown environments presents a significant challenge, requiring a delicate balance between efficient exploration and robust planning. Traditional path planners, which treat the environment as a geometric grid, often suffer from redundant searches and are prone to failure in complex scenarios due to their lack of semantic understanding. To overcome these limitations, we reframe path planning in unknown environments as a semantic reasoning task. We introduce a Semantic Agent for Tensegrity robots (SATPlanner) driven by a Large Language Model (LLM). SATPlanner leverages high-level environmental comprehension to generate efficient and reliable planning strategies.At the core of SATPlanner is an Adaptive Observation Window mechanism, inspired by the "fast" and "slow" thinking paradigms of LLMs. This mechanism dynamically adjusts the perceptual field of the agent: it narrows for rapid traversal of open spaces and expands to reason about complex obstacle configurations. This allows the agent to construct a semantic belief of the environment, enabling the search space to grow only linearly with the path length (O(L)) while maintaining path quality. We extensively evaluate SATPlanner in 1,000 simulation trials, where it achieves a 100% success rate, outperforming other real-time planning algorithms. Critically, SATPlanner reduces the search space by 37.2% compared to the A* algorithm while achieving comparable, near-optimal path lengths. Finally, the practical feasibility of SATPlanner is validated on a physical spherical tensegrity robot prototype.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

A new robotic system that focuses on improving tooltip accuracy, tracking performance, and smooth instrument exchange mechanism is therefore designed and manufactured. Its tooltip accuracy, precision, and mechanical capability of maintaining small incision through remote center of motion were externally evaluated using an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system. Through robot calibration and precise coordinate registration, the accuracy of tooltip positioning was measured to be 0.053$\pm$0.031 mm, and the overall performance was demonstrated on an OCT-guided automated cataract lens extraction procedure with deep learning-based pre-operative anatomical modeling and real-time supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tackling the Kidnapped Robot Problem via Sparse Feasible Hypothesis Sampling and Reliable Batched Multi-Stage Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01219v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the Kidnapped Robot Problem (KRP), a core localization challenge of relocalizing a robot in a known map without prior pose estimate when localization loss or at SLAM initialization. For this purpose, a passive 2-D global relocalization framework is proposed. It estimates the global pose efficiently and reliably from a single LiDAR scan and an occupancy grid map while the robot remains stationary, thereby enhancing the long-term autonomy of mobile robots. The proposed framework casts global relocalization as a non-convex problem and solves it via the multi-hypothesis scheme with batched multi-stage inference and early termination, balancing completeness and efficiency. The Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), under traversability constraints, asymptotically covers the reachable space to generate sparse, uniformly distributed feasible positional hypotheses, fundamentally reducing the sampling space. The hypotheses are preliminarily ordered by the proposed Scan Mean Absolute Difference (SMAD), a coarse beam-error level metric that facilitates the early termination by prioritizing high-likelihood candidates. The SMAD computation is optimized for non-panoramic scans. And the Translation-Affinity Scan-to-Map Alignment Metric (TAM) is proposed for reliable orientation selection at hypothesized positions and accurate final pose evaluation to mitigate degradation in conventional likelihood-field metrics under translational uncertainty induced by sparse hypotheses, as well as non-panoramic LiDAR scan and environmental changes. Real-world experiments on a resource-constrained mobile robot with non-panoramic LiDAR scan demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in both global relocalization success rate and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures.

Common imaging modalities, such as fluoroscopy and ultrasound, have limitations that can be overcome using cardioscopy, i.e., direct optical visualization inside the beating heart. We present a cardioscope designed as a steerable balloon. As a balloon, it can be collapsed to pass through the vasculature and subsequently inflated inside the heart for visualization and tool delivery through an integrated working channel. Through careful design of balloon wall thickness, a single input, balloon inflation pressure, is used to independently control two outputs, balloon diameter (corresponding to field of view diameter) and balloon bending angle (enabling precise working channel positioning). This balloon technology can be tuned to produce cardioscopes designed for a range of intracardiac tasks. To illustrate this approach, a balloon design is presented for the specific task of aortic leaflet laceration. Image-based closed-loop control of bending angle is also demonstrated as a means of enabling stable orientation control during tool insertion and removal.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures |

This paper examines three paradigms for building robotic systems: end-to-end vision-language-action (VLA) models that implicitly integrate perception and planning, and modular pipelines incorporating either vision-language models (VLMs) or multimodal large language models (LLMs). We evaluate these paradigms through two focused case studies: a complex instruction grounding task assessing fine-grained instruction understanding and cross-modal disambiguation, and an object manipulation task targeting skill transfer via VLA finetuning. Our experiments in zero-shot and few-shot settings reveal trade-offs in generalization and data efficiency. By exploring performance limits, we distill design implications for developing language-driven physical agents and outline emerging challenges and opportunities for FM-powered robotics in real-world conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 camera ready</p></details> |

By integrating inertial measurement units (IMUs) with complementary bend sensors, IMU drift is mitigated, enabling reliable long-term proprioception. A Kalman filter fuses segment tip orientations from both sensors in a mutually compensatory manner, improving shape estimation over single-sensor methods. A piecewise constant curvature model estimates the tip location from the fused orientation data and reconstructs the robot's deformation. Experiments under no loading, external forces, and passive obstacle interactions during 45 minutes of continuous operation showed a root mean square error of 16.96 mm (2.91% of total length), a 56% reduction compared to IMU-only benchmarks. These results demonstrate that our approach not only enables long-duration proprioception in soft robots but also maintains high accuracy and robustness across these diverse conditions.</p></details> |  |

We pursue a road less traveled: building generalist policies directly around VLMs by augmenting their general capabilities with specific robot capabilities encapsulated in a carefully curated set of perception, planning, and control modules. In Maestro, a VLM coding agent dynamically composes these modules into a programmatic policy for the current task and scenario. Maestro's architecture benefits from a streamlined closed-loop interface without many manually imposed structural constraints, and a comprehensive and diverse tool repertoire. As a result, it largely surpasses today's VLA models for zero-shot performance on challenging manipulation skills. Further, Maestro is easily extensible to incorporate new modules, easily editable to suit new embodiments such as a quadruped-mounted arm, and even easily adapts from minimal real-world experiences through local code edits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://maestro-robot.github.io</p></details> |

This design steers autonomously the unicycle dynamic system towards the extremum point of an objective function or physical/scaler signal that is unknown expression-wise, but accessible via measurements. A key contribution of this paper is that the introduced design converges exponentially to the extremum point of objective functions (or scaler signals) that behave locally like a higher-degree power functions (e.g., fourth degree polynomial function) as opposed to locally quadratic objective functions, the usual case in literature. We provide theoretical and simulation results to support out theoretical results. Also, for the first time in the literature, we provide experimental robotic results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design and its exponential convergence ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboOmni: Proactive Robot Manipulation in Omni-modal Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23763v3)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have driven rapid progress in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation. Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue, environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition, while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640 backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and proactive assistance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Uncanny Valley: A Mixed-Method Investigation of Anthropomorphism in Protective Responses to Robot Abuse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26082v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots with anthropomorphic features are increasingly shaping how humans perceive and morally engage with them. Our research investigates how different levels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse, extending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories into a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view videos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot), or high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we triangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and uncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and qualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not linear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in eeriness and "spine-tingling" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley, elicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and guilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots compared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as anthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments of property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance proposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader societal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not dampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering critical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knolling Bot: Teaching Robots the Human Notion of Tidiness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04566v3)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For robots to truly collaborate and assist humans, they must understand not only logic and instructions, but also the subtle emotions, aesthetics, and feelings that define our humanity. Human art and aesthetics are among the most elusive concepts-often difficult even for people to articulate-and without grasping these fundamentals, robots will be unable to help in many spheres of daily life. Consider the long-promised robotic butler: automating domestic chores demands more than motion planning. It requires an internal model of cleanliness and tidiness-a challenge largely unexplored by AI. To bridge this gap, we propose an approach that equips domestic robots to perform simple tidying tasks via knolling, the practice of arranging scattered items into neat, space-efficient layouts. Unlike the uniformity of industrial settings, household environments feature diverse objects and highly subjective notions of tidiness. Drawing inspiration from NLP, we treat knolling as a sequential prediction problem and employ a transformer based model to forecast each object's placement. Our method learns a generalizable concept of tidiness, generates diverse solutions adaptable to varying object sets, and incorporates human preferences for personalized arrangements. This work represents a step forward in building robots that internalize human aesthetic sense and can genuinely co-create in our living spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Creative AI Track</p></details> |

We tested whether proprioceptively-tailored robotic training improves hand function and neural processing in stroke survivors. Using a robotic finger exoskeleton, we tested two proprioceptively-tailored approaches: Propriopixel Training, which uses robot-facilitated, gamified movements to enhance proprioceptive processing, and Virtual Assistance Training, which reduces robotic aid to increase reliance on self-generated feedback. In a randomized controlled trial, forty-six chronic stroke survivors completed nine 2-hour sessions of Standard, Propriopixel or Virtual training. Among participants with proprioceptive deficits, Propriopixel ((Box and Block Test: 7 +/- 4.2, p=0.002) and Virtual Assistance (4.5 +/- 4.4 , p=0.068) yielded greater gains in hand function (Standard: 0.8 +/- 2.3 blocks). Proprioceptive gains correlated with improvements in hand function. Tailored training enhanced neural sensitivity to proprioceptive cues, evidenced by a novel EEG biomarker, the proprioceptive Contingent Negative Variation. These findings support proprioceptively-tailored training as a pathway to precision neurorehabilitation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main manuscript: 38 pages (double spaced, with references), 6 figures, 2 tables and collated supplemental materials (17 pages, double spaced)</p></details> |

We evaluate whether time-series foundation models can replace unrecorded trials from an early subset of reaches while preserving the reliability of standard Kinarm parameters. Methods: We analyzed VGR speed signals from 461 stroke and 599 control participants across 4- and 8-target reaching protocols. We withheld all but the first 8 or 16 reaching trials and used ARIMA, MOMENT, and Chronos models, fine-tuned on 70 percent of subjects, to forecast synthetic trials. We recomputed four kinematic features of reaching (reaction time, movement time, posture speed, maximum speed) on combined recorded plus forecasted trials and compared them to full-length references using ICC(2,1). Results: Chronos forecasts restored ICC >= 0.90 for all parameters with only 8 recorded trials plus forecasts, matching the reliability of 24-28 recorded reaches (Delta ICC <= 0.07). MOMENT yielded intermediate gains, while ARIMA improvements were minimal. Across cohorts and protocols, synthetic trials replaced reaches without materially compromising feature reliability. Conclusion: Foundation-model forecasting can greatly shorten Kinarm VGR assessment time. For the most impaired stroke survivors, sessions drop from 4-5 minutes to about 1 minute while preserving kinematic precision. This forecast-augmented paradigm promises efficient robotic evaluations for assessing motor impairments following stroke.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-Based Online Key Point Estimation of Deformable Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05222v3)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The precise control of soft and continuum robots requires knowledge of their shape, which has, in contrast to classical rigid robots, infinite degrees of freedom. To partially reconstruct the shape, proprioceptive techniques use built-in sensors resulting in inaccurate results and increased fabrication complexity. Exteroceptive methods so far rely on expensive tracking systems with reflective markers placed on all components, which are infeasible for deformable robots interacting with the environment due to marker occlusion and damage. Here, a regression approach is presented for 3D key point estimation using a convolutional neural network. The proposed approach takes advantage of data-driven supervised learning and is capable of online marker-less estimation during inference. Two images of a robotic system are taken simultaneously at 25 Hz from two different perspectives, and are fed to the network, which returns for each pair the parameterized key point or PCC shape representations. The proposed approach outperforms marker-less state-of-the-art methods by a maximum of 4.5% in estimation accuracy while at the same time being more robust and requiring no prior knowledge of the shape. Online evaluations on two types of soft robotic arms and a soft robotic fish demonstrate our method's accuracy and versatility on highly deformable systems.</p></details> |  |

Enabling a robotic system to perform diverse sequential tasks with a broad range of manipulation skills is an active area of research. In this work, we present a Hybrid Hierarchical Learning framework, the Robotic Manipulation Network (ROMAN), to address the challenge of solving multiple complex tasks over long time horizons in robotic manipulation. ROMAN achieves task versatility and robust failure recovery by integrating behavioural cloning, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning. It consists of a central manipulation network that coordinates an ensemble of various neural networks, each specialising in distinct re-combinable sub-tasks to generate their correct in-sequence actions for solving complex long-horizon manipulation tasks. Experimental results show that by orchestrating and activating these specialised manipulation experts, ROMAN generates correct sequential activations for accomplishing long sequences of sophisticated manipulation tasks and achieving adaptive behaviours beyond demonstrations, while exhibiting robustness to various sensory noises. These results demonstrate the significance and versatility of ROMAN's dynamic adaptability featuring autonomous failure recovery capabilities, and highlight its potential for various autonomous manipulation tasks that demand adaptive motor skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Nature Machine Intelligence.

This has motivated research on methods to automatically create control policies. However, these methods require iterative processes of manually crafting and refining objective functions, thereby prolonging the development cycle. This work introduces \textit{GenSwarm}, an end-to-end system that leverages large language models to automatically generate and deploy control policies for multi-robot tasks based on simple user instructions in natural language. As a multi-language-agent system, GenSwarm achieves zero-shot learning, enabling rapid adaptation to altered or unseen tasks.

The behaviors and their intensities are realized on an arm robot. Results illustrate a coherent pipeline from internal state parameters to graded endurance motions and, once a limit is crossed, to avoidance actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on Socially Aware and Cooperative Intelligent Systems in HAI 2025</p></details> |

Existing data-driven approaches often fail to generalize, constrained by narrowly focused task demonstrations or inefficient random exploration. We introduce SoftAE, an uncertainty-aware active exploration framework that autonomously learns task-agnostic and generalizable dynamics models of soft robotic systems. SoftAE employs probabilistic ensemble models to estimate epistemic uncertainty and actively guides exploration toward underrepresented regions of the state-action space, achieving efficient coverage of diverse behaviors without task-specific supervision. We evaluate SoftAE on three simulated soft robotic platforms -- a continuum arm, an articulated fish in fluid, and a musculoskeletal leg with hybrid actuation -- and on a pneumatically actuated continuum soft arm in the real world. Compared with random exploration and task-specific model-based reinforcement learning, SoftAE produces more accurate dynamics models, enables superior zero-shot control on unseen tasks, and maintains robustness under sensing noise, actuation delays, and nonlinear material effects. These results demonstrate that uncertainty-driven active exploration can yield scalable, reusable dynamics models across diverse soft robotic morphologies, representing a step toward more autonomous, adaptable, and data-efficient control in compliant robots.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, this study proposes MobiDock, a modular self-reconfigurable mobile manipulator system that allows two independent robots to physically connect and form a unified mobile bimanual platform. This process helps transform a complex multi-robot control problem into the management of a simpler, single system. The system utilizes an autonomous docking strategy based on computer vision with AprilTag markers and a new threaded screw-lock mechanism. Experimental results show that the docked configuration demonstrates better performance in dynamic stability and operational efficiency compared to two independently cooperating robots. Specifically, the unified system has lower Root Mean Square (RMS) Acceleration and Jerk values, higher angular precision, and completes tasks significantly faster. These findings confirm that physical reconfiguration is a powerful design principle that simplifies cooperative control, improving stability and performance for complex tasks in real-world environments.</p></details> | ICRA2026 submited |

Existing systems are mostly designed for large, open-water environments and struggle in industrial settings due to poor coverage, reliance on external infrastructure, and the need for feature-rich surroundings. Multipath effects from continuous sound reflections further degrade signal quality, reducing accuracy and reliability. Accurate and easily deployable positioning is essential for repeatable autonomous missions; however, this requirement has created a technological bottleneck limiting underwater robotic deployment. This paper presents the Collaborative Aquatic Positioning (CAP) system, which integrates collaborative robotics and sensor fusion to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the "mother-ship" concept, the surface vehicle acts as a mobile leader to assist in positioning a submerged robot, enabling localization even in GPS-denied and highly constrained environments. The system is validated in a large test tank through repeatable autonomous missions using CAP's position estimates for real-time trajectory control. Experimental results demonstrate a mean Euclidean distance (MED) error of 70 mm, achieved in real time without requiring fixed infrastructure, extensive calibration, or environmental features. CAP leverages advances in mobile robot sensing and leader-follower control to deliver a step change in accurate, practical, and infrastructure-free underwater localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages including appendix, 24 figures</p></details> |

Achieving these capabilities requires agents to understand the underlying mechanisms and dynamics of the world, moving beyond purely reactive control or simple replication of observed states. This motivates the development of world models as internal representations that encode environmental states, capture dynamics, and enable prediction, planning, and reasoning. Despite growing interest, the definition, scope, architectures, and essential capabilities of world models remain ambiguous. In this survey, rather than directly imposing a fixed definition and limiting our scope to methods explicitly labeled as world models, we examine approaches that exhibit the core capabilities of world models through a review of methods in robotic manipulation. We analyze their roles across perception, prediction, and control, identify key challenges and solutions, and distill the core components, capabilities, and functions that a real world model should possess. Building on this analysis, we aim to outline a roadmap for developing generalizable and practical world models for robotics.</p></details> | 24 pages, 5 figures |

Existing vision_language models (VLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with fine-grained spatial reasoning due to their implicit, correlation-driven reasoning and reliance solely on images. We propose a novel neuro_symbolic framework that integrates both panoramic-image and 3D point cloud information, combining neural perception with symbolic reasoning to explicitly model spatial and logical relationships. Our framework consists of a perception module for detecting entities and extracting attributes, and a reasoning module that constructs a structured scene graph to support precise, interpretable queries. Evaluated on the JRDB-Reasoning dataset, our approach demonstrates superior performance and reliability in crowded, human_built environments while maintaining a lightweight design suitable for robotics and embodied AI applications.</p></details> |  |

Soft growing vine robot systems are particularly promising for navigating confined, sinuous paths such as in pipes, but are currently limited by complex subsystems and a lack of validation in real-world industrial settings. In this paper, we introduce the concept and implementation of a hermetic and transparent vine robot system for visual condition assessment and mapping within non-branching pipes. This design encloses all mechanical and electrical components within the vine robot's soft, airtight, and transparent body, protecting them from environmental interference while enabling visual sensing. Because this approach requires an enclosed mechanism for transporting sensors, we developed, modeled, and tested a passively adapting enclosed tip mount.

| **[Understanding the Application of Utility Theory in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09445v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a unifying concept in economics, game theory, and operations research, even in the Robotics and AI field, the utility is used to evaluate the level of individual needs, preferences, and interests. Especially for decision-making and learning in multi-agent/robot systems (MAS/MRS), a suitable utility model can guide agents in choosing reasonable strategies to achieve their current needs and learning to cooperate and organize their behaviors, optimizing the system's utility, building stable and reliable relationships, and guaranteeing each group member's sustainable development, similar to the human society. Although these systems' complex, large-scale, and long-term behaviors are strongly determined by the fundamental characteristics of the underlying relationships, there has been less discussion on the theoretical aspects of mechanisms and the fields of applications in Robotics and AI. This paper introduces a utility-orient needs paradigm to describe and evaluate inter and outer relationships among agents' interactions. Then, we survey existing literature in relevant fields to support it and propose several promising research directions along with some open problems deemed necessary for further investigations.</p></details> | <details><summary>I am ...</summary><p>I am not sure whether withdrawing this paper is suitable.

| **[Object-Centric Kinodynamic Planning for Nonprehensile Robot Rearrangement Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00261v4)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonprehensile actions such as pushing are crucial for addressing multi-object rearrangement problems. Many traditional methods generate robot-centric actions, which differ from intuitive human strategies and are typically inefficient. To this end, we adopt an object-centric planning paradigm and propose a unified framework for addressing a range of large-scale, physics-intensive nonprehensile rearrangement problems challenged by modeling inaccuracies and real-world uncertainties. By assuming each object can actively move without being driven by robot interactions, our planner first computes desired object motions, which are then realized through robot actions generated online via a closed-loop pushing strategy. Through extensive experiments and in comparison with state-of-the-art baselines in both simulation and on a physical robot, we show that our object-centric planning framework can generate more intuitive and task-effective robot actions with significantly improved efficiency. In addition, we propose a benchmarking protocol to standardize and facilitate future research in nonprehensile rearrangement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Robot Collaboration in Unstructured Environments with Grounded Generative Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26915v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heterogeneous robot teams operating in realistic settings often must accomplish complex missions requiring collaboration and adaptation to information acquired online. Because robot teams frequently operate in unstructured environments -- uncertain, open-world settings without prior maps -- subtasks must be grounded in robot capabilities and the physical world. While heterogeneous teams have typically been designed for fixed specifications, generative intelligence opens the possibility of teams that can accomplish a wide range of missions described in natural language. However, current large language model (LLM)-enabled teaming methods typically assume well-structured and known environments, limiting deployment in unstructured environments. We present SPINE-HT, a framework that addresses these limitations by grounding the reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of a heterogeneous robot team through a three-stage process. Given language specifications describing mission goals and team capabilities, an LLM generates grounded subtasks which are validated for feasibility. Subtasks are then assigned to robots based on capabilities such as traversability or perception and refined given feedback collected during online operation. In simulation experiments with closed-loop perception and control, our framework achieves nearly twice the success rate compared to prior LLM-enabled heterogeneous teaming approaches. In real-world experiments with a Clearpath Jackal, a Clearpath Husky, a Boston Dynamics Spot, and a high-altitude UAV, our method achieves an 87\% success rate in missions requiring reasoning about robot capabilities and refining subtasks with online feedback.

| **[Hybrid Consistency Policy: Decoupling Multi-Modal Diversity and Real-Time Efficiency in Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26670v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In visuomotor policy learning, diffusion-based imitation learning has become widely adopted for its ability to capture diverse behaviors. However, approaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to jointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these challenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short stochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step consistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump generation, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a trajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a denoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and on a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step DDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing latency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow inference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed. It yields a practical accuracy efficiency trade-off for robot policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Sliding-Window Filter for Online Continuous-Time Continuum Robot State Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26623v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic state estimation methods for continuum robots (CRs) often struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. While several recent works have explored sliding-window formulations for CRs, these methods are limited to simplified, discrete-time approximations and do not provide stochastic representations. In contrast, current stochastic filter methods must run at the speed of measurements, limiting their full potential. Recent works in continuous-time estimation techniques for CRs show a principled approach to addressing this runtime constraint, but are currently restricted to offline operation. In this work, we present a sliding-window filter (SWF) for continuous-time state estimation of CRs that improves upon the accuracy of a filter approach while enabling continuous-time methods to operate online, all while running at faster-than-real-time speeds. This represents the first stochastic SWF specifically designed for CRs, providing a promising direction for future research in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

At its core, PoseDiff maps raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy. This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between perception, planning, and control in embodied AI. The video visualization results can be found on the project page: https://haozhuo-zhang.github.io/PoseDiff-project-page/.</p></details> | <details><summary>The e...</summary><p>The experimental setup and metrics lacks rigor, affecting the fairness of the comparisons</p></details> |

Driven by the essential components of tool usage - grasping the desired outcome, selecting the most suitable tool, determining optimal tool orientation, and executing precise manipulations - we introduce a pioneering framework. Our novel approach expands the capabilities of the robot's inverse kinematics solver, empowering it to acquire a sequential repertoire of actions using tools of varying lengths. By integrating a simulation-learned action trajectory with the tool, we showcase the practicality of transferring acquired skills from simulation to real-world scenarios through comprehensive experimentation. Remarkably, our extended inverse kinematics solver demonstrates an impressive error rate of less than 1 cm. Furthermore, our trained policy achieves a mean error of 8 cm in simulation. Noteworthy, our model achieves virtually indistinguishable performance when employing two distinct tools of different lengths. This research provides an indication of potential advances in the exploration of all four fundamental aspects of tool usage, enabling robots to master the intricate art of tool manipulation across diverse tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

Existing approaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical frameworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent memory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long horizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting the need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we introduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable, and robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel Spatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene geometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared representation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a brain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global planning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute actions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution enables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent state synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex coordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results demonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous embodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and robust multi-robot collaboration.

| **[Human-in-the-loop Online Rejection Sampling for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26406v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to produce robust robotic manipulation policies, but fine-tuning vision-language-action (VLA) models with RL can be unstable due to inaccurate value estimates and sparse supervision at intermediate steps. In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but often underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose Hi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection sampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS stabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during online fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective to provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we develop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible online human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for learning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two embodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich manipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL baselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency. Notably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by reliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better performance.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, their effective operation in dynamic settings - such as smart cities and precision farming - is challenged by continuously evolving topographies and environmental conditions. Traditional control systems often struggle to adapt quickly, leading to inefficiencies or operational failures. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework for autonomous and dynamic reconfiguration of robotic controllers using Digital Twin technology. Our approach leverages a virtual replica of the robot's operational environment to simulate and optimize movement trajectories in response to real-world changes. By recalculating paths and control parameters in the Digital Twin and deploying the updated code to the physical robot, our method ensures rapid and reliable adaptation without manual intervention. This work advances the integration of Digital Twins in robotics, offering a scalable solution for enhancing autonomy in smart, dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation to 11th IEEE International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Human-assisted Robotic Policy Refinement via Action Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07127v3)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Establishing a reliable and iteratively refined robotic system is essential for deploying real-world applications. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are widely recognized as the foundation model for such robotic deployment, their reliance on offline expert demonstrations critically limits their capacity for post-deployment refinement. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce Action Preference Optimization (APO), a method designed to refine VLA models by human-assisted preference alignment gathered through interaction with environments. This method begins with a human-robot collaboration framework for reliable failure correction and interaction trajectory collection through human intervention. However, directly leveraging these interaction trajectories for preference optimization is non-trivial due to the challenges of irreversible robotic actions and token distribution mismatch. To solve this, APO proposes an adaptive reweighting algorithm with binary desirability signals derived from interaction, empowering VLA models effectively suppress failure-prone actions while enhancing corrective action adaptation. Ultimately, APO equips VLA models with the crucial capability to learn from failure, paving the way for their iterative refinement and reliable deployment in dynamic environments. The experiments conducted in simulation and real-world scenarios prove superior generalization and robustness of our human-assisted framework across a variety of manipulation tasks. We believe this work could bring insights for efficient and stable optimization of VLA models through human-robot collaboration. The code and dataset are released at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/Action-Preference-Optimization</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted By NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[I don't Want You to Die: A Shared Responsibility Framework for Safeguarding Child-Robot Companionship](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26080v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social robots like Moxie are designed to form strong emotional bonds with children, but their abrupt discontinuation can cause significant struggles and distress to children. When these services end, the resulting harm raises complex questions of who bears responsibility when children's emotional bonds are broken. Using the Moxie shutdown as a case study through a qualitative survey of 72 U.S. participants, our findings show that the responsibility is viewed as a shared duty across the robot company, parents, developers, and government. However, these attributions varied by political ideology and parental status of whether they have children. Participants' perceptions of whether the robot service should continue are highly polarized; supporters propose technical, financial, and governmental pathways for continuity, while opponents cite business realities and risks of unhealthy emotional dependency. Ultimately, this research contributes an empirically grounded shared responsibility framework for safeguarding child-robot companionship by detailing how accountability is distributed and contested, informing concrete design and policy implications to mitigate the emotional harm of robot discontinuation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Morphology-Aware Graph Reinforcement Learning for Tensegrity Robot Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26067v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensegrity robots combine rigid rods and elastic cables, offering high resilience and deployability but posing major challenges for locomotion control due to their underactuated and highly coupled dynamics. This paper introduces a morphology-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph neural network (GNN) into the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. By representing the robot's physical topology as a graph, the proposed GNN-based policy captures coupling among components, enabling faster and more stable learning than conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies. The method is validated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion primitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning. It shows superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations, and improved trajectory accuracy. Notably, the learned policies transfer directly from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning, achieving stable real-world locomotion. These results demonstrate the advantages of incorporating structural priors into reinforcement learning for tensegrity robot control.</p></details> |  |
