| **[MoK-RAG: Mixture of Knowledge Paths Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Embodied AI Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13882v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While human cognition inherently retrieves information from diverse and specialized knowledge sources during decision-making processes, current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically operate through single-source knowledge retrieval, leading to a cognitive-algorithmic discrepancy. To bridge this gap, we introduce MoK-RAG, a novel multi-source RAG framework that implements a mixture of knowledge paths enhanced retrieval mechanism through functional partitioning of a large language model (LLM) corpus into distinct sections, enabling retrieval from multiple specialized knowledge paths. Applied to the generation of 3D simulated environments, our proposed MoK-RAG3D enhances this paradigm by partitioning 3D assets into distinct sections and organizing them based on a hierarchical knowledge tree structure. Different from previous methods that only use manual evaluation, we pioneered the introduction of automated evaluation methods for 3D scenes. Both automatic and human evaluations in our experiments demonstrate that MoK-RAG3D can assist Embodied AI agents in generating diverse scenes.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods for creating articulated objects are either data-driven or simulation based, which are limited by the scale and quality of the training data or the fidelity and heavy labour of the simulation. In this paper, we propose Infinite Mobility, a novel method for synthesizing high-fidelity articulated objects through procedural generation. User study and quantitative evaluation demonstrate that our method can produce results that excel current state-of-the-art methods and are comparable to human-annotated datasets in both physics property and mesh quality. Furthermore, we show that our synthetic data can be used as training data for generative models, enabling next-step scaling up.

| **[Exploring 3D Activity Reasoning and Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D activity reasoning and planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advance in multimodal learning. However, most existing works share two constraints: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. To bridge the gaps, we propose 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans, and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[HIS-GPT: Towards 3D Human-In-Scene Multimodal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12955v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new task to benchmark human-in-scene understanding for embodied agents: Human-In-Scene Question Answering (HIS-QA). Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning in visual navigation of end-to-end trained agents: a dynamical systems approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08306v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Progress in Embodied AI has made it possible for end-to-end-trained agents to navigate in photo-realistic environments with high-level reasoning and zero-shot or language-conditioned behavior, but benchmarks are still dominated by simulation. In this work, we focus on the fine-grained behavior of fast-moving real robots and present a large-scale experimental study involving \numepisodes{} navigation episodes in a real environment with a physical robot, where we analyze the type of reasoning emerging from end-to-end training. In particular, we study the presence of realistic dynamics which the agent learned for open-loop forecasting, and their interplay with sensing. We analyze the way the agent uses latent memory to hold elements of the scene structure and information gathered during exploration. We probe the planning capabilities of the agent, and find in its memory evidence for somewhat precise plans over a limited horizon. Furthermore, we show in a post-hoc analysis that the value function learned by the agent relates to long-term planning. Put together, our experiments paint a new picture on how using tools from computer vision and sequential decision making have led to new capabilities in robotics and control. An interactive tool is available at europe.naverlabs.com/research/publications/reasoning-in-visual-navigation-of-end-to-end-trained-agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[S2O: Static to Openable Enhancement for Articulated 3D Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18896v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite much progress in large 3D datasets there are currently few interactive 3D object datasets, and their scale is limited due to the manual effort required in their construction. We introduce the static to openable (S2O) task which creates interactive articulated 3D objects from static counterparts through openable part detection, motion prediction, and interior geometry completion. We formulate a unified framework to tackle this task, and curate a challenging dataset of openable 3D objects that serves as a test bed for systematic evaluation. Our experiments benchmark methods from prior work, extended and improved methods, and simple yet effective heuristics for the S2O task. We find that turning static 3D objects into interactively openable counterparts is possible but that all methods struggle to generalize to realistic settings of the task, and we highlight promising future work directions. Our work enables efficient creation of interactive 3D objects for robotic manipulation and embodied AI tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoMa-Kitchen: A 100K+ Benchmark for Affordance-Grounded Last-Mile Navigation in Mobile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11081v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mobile manipulation, navigation and manipulation are often treated as separate problems, resulting in a significant gap between merely approaching an object and engaging with it effectively. Many navigation approaches primarily define success by proximity to the target, often overlooking the necessity for optimal positioning that facilitates subsequent manipulation. To address this, we introduce MoMa-Kitchen, a benchmark dataset comprising over 100k samples that provide training data for models to learn optimal final navigation positions for seamless transition to manipulation. Our dataset includes affordance-grounded floor labels collected from diverse kitchen environments, in which robotic mobile manipulators of different models attempt to grasp target objects amidst clutter. Using a fully automated pipeline, we simulate diverse real-world scenarios and generate affordance labels for optimal manipulation positions. Visual data are collected from RGB-D inputs captured by a first-person view camera mounted on the robotic arm, ensuring consistency in viewpoint during data collection. We also develop a lightweight baseline model, NavAff, for navigation affordance grounding that demonstrates promising performance on the MoMa-Kitchen benchmark. Our approach enables models to learn affordance-based final positioning that accommodates different arm types and platform heights, thereby paving the way for more robust and generalizable integration of navigation and manipulation in embodied AI.

| **[Making Every Frame Matter: Continuous Activity Recognition in Streaming Video via Adaptive Video Context Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14993v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video activity recognition has become increasingly important in robots and embodied AI. Recognizing continuous video activities poses considerable challenges due to the fast expansion of streaming video, which contains multi-scale and untrimmed activities. We introduce a novel system, CARS, to overcome these issues through adaptive video context modeling. Adaptive video context modeling refers to selectively maintaining activity-related features in temporal and spatial dimensions. CARS has two key designs. The first is an activity spatial feature extraction by eliminating irrelevant visual features while maintaining recognition accuracy. The second is an activity-aware state update introducing dynamic adaptability to better preserve the video context for multi-scale activity recognition. Our CARS runs at speeds $>$30 FPS on typical edge devices and outperforms all baselines by 1.2\% to 79.7\% in accuracy. Moreover, we explore applying CARS to a large video model as a video encoder. Experimental results show that our CARS can result in a 0.46-point enhancement (on a 5-point scale) on the in-distribution video activity dataset, and an improvement ranging from 1.19\% to 4\% on zero-shot video activity datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[6D Object Pose Tracking in Internet Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10307v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek to extract a temporally consistent 6D pose trajectory of a manipulated object from an Internet instructional video. This is a challenging set-up for current 6D pose estimation methods due to uncontrolled capturing conditions, subtle but dynamic object motions, and the fact that the exact mesh of the manipulated object is not known. To address these challenges, we present the following contributions. First, we develop a new method that estimates the 6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object itself. The method proceeds by (i) retrieving a CAD model similar to the depicted object from a large-scale model database, (ii) 6D aligning the retrieved CAD model with the input image, and (iii) grounding the absolute scale of the object with respect to the scene. Second, we extract smooth 6D object trajectories from Internet videos by carefully tracking the detected objects across video frames. The extracted object trajectories are then retargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a robotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose estimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of instructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object trajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art RGB 6D pose estimation methods. Finally, we show that the 6D object motion estimated from Internet videos can be transferred to a 7-axis robotic manipulator both in a virtual simulator as well as in a real world set-up. We also successfully apply our method to egocentric videos taken from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset, demonstrating potential for Embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[Long-horizon Embodied Planning with Implicit Logical Inference and Hallucination Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15658v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon embodied planning underpins embodied AI. To accomplish long-horizon tasks, one of the most feasible ways is to decompose abstract instructions into a sequence of actionable steps. Foundation models still face logical errors and hallucinations in long-horizon planning, unless provided with highly relevant examples to the tasks. However, providing highly relevant examples for any random task is unpractical. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a novel framework for Real-time Long-horizon Embodied Planning. ReLEP can complete a wide range of long-horizon tasks without in-context examples by learning implicit logical inference through fine-tuning. The fine-tuned large vision-language model formulates plans as sequences of skill functions. These functions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also equipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot Configuration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we propose a data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. When constructing the dataset, we considered the implicit logical relationships, enabling the model to learn implicit logical relationships and dispel hallucinations. Through comprehensive evaluations across various long-horizon tasks, ReLEP demonstrates high success rates and compliance to execution even on unseen tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[AhaRobot: A Low-Cost Open-Source Bimanual Mobile Manipulator for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10070v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation and manipulation in open-world environments remain unsolved challenges in the Embodied AI. The high cost of commercial mobile manipulation robots significantly limits research in real-world scenes. To address this issue, we propose AhaRobot, a low-cost and fully open-source dual-arm mobile manipulation robot system with a hardware cost of only $1,000 (excluding optional computational resources), which is less than 1/15 of the cost of popular mobile robots. The AhaRobot system consists of three components: (1) a novel low-cost hardware architecture primarily composed of off-the-shelf components, (2) an optimized control solution to enhance operational precision integrating dual-motor backlash control and static friction compensation, and (3) a simple remote teleoperation method RoboPilot. We use handles to control the dual arms and pedals for whole-body movement. The teleoperation process is low-burden and easy to operate, much like piloting. RoboPilot is designed for remote data collection in embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboPilot significantly enhances data collection efficiency in complex manipulation tasks, achieving a 30% increase compared to methods using 3D mouse and leader-follower systems. It also excels at completing extremely long-horizon tasks in one go. Furthermore, AhaRobot can be used to learn end-to-end policies and autonomously perform complex manipulation tasks, such as pen insertion and cleaning up the floor. We aim to build an affordable yet powerful platform to promote the development of embodied tasks on real devices, advancing more robust and reliable embodied AI.

| **[EmBARDiment: an Embodied AI Agent for Productivity in XR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08158v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>XR devices running chat-bots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have the to become always-on agents that enable much better productivity scenarios. Current screen based chat-bots do not take advantage of the the full-suite of natural inputs available in XR, including inward facing sensor data, instead they over-rely on explicit voice or text prompts, sometimes paired with multi-modal data dropped as part of the query. We propose a solution that leverages an attention framework that derives context implicitly from user actions, eye-gaze, and contextual memory within the XR environment. Our work minimizes the need for engineered explicit prompts, fostering grounded and intuitive interactions that glean user insights for the chat-bot.</p></details> |  |
| **[HO-Cap: A Capture System and Dataset for 3D Reconstruction and Pose Tracking of Hand-Object Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06843v4)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a data capture system and a new dataset, HO-Cap, for 3D reconstruction and pose tracking of hands and objects in videos. The system leverages multiple RGBD cameras and a HoloLens headset for data collection, avoiding the use of expensive 3D scanners or mocap systems. We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied AI, requiring an agent to locate a target object in previously unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the Effectiveness of a Socratic Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning Method for Task Planning in Robotics, A Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08174v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in reasoning with natural language. Coupled with this development is the emergence of embodied AI in robotics. Despite showing promise for verbal and written reasoning tasks, it remains unknown whether LLMs are capable of navigating complex spatial tasks with physical actions in the real world. To this end, it is of interest to investigate applying LLMs to robotics in zero-shot learning scenarios, and in the absence of fine-tuning - a feat which could significantly improve human-robot interaction, alleviate compute cost, and eliminate low-level programming tasks associated with robot tasks. To explore this question, we apply GPT-4(Omni) with a simulated Tiago robot in Webots engine for an object search task. We evaluate the effectiveness of three reasoning strategies based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sub-task list generation with the Socratic method (SocraCoT) (in order of increasing rigor): (1) Non-CoT/Non-SocraCoT, (2) CoT only, and (3) SocraCoT. Performance was measured in terms of the proportion of tasks successfully completed and execution time (N = 20). Our preliminary results show that when combined with chain-of-thought reasoning, the Socratic method can be used for code generation for robotic tasks that require spatial awareness. In extension of this finding, we propose EVINCE-LoC; a modified EVINCE method that could further enhance performance in highly complex and or dynamic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenFly: A Versatile Toolchain and Large-scale Benchmark for Aerial Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18041v4)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to guide agents through an environment by leveraging both language instructions and visual cues, playing a pivotal role in embodied AI. Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Dynamic Hand-Object Interactions with Applications to Human-Robot Handovers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04879v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans frequently grasp, manipulate, and move objects. Interactive systems assist humans in these tasks, enabling applications in Embodied AI, human-robot interaction, and virtual reality. However, current methods in hand-object synthesis often neglect dynamics and focus on generating static grasps. The first part of this dissertation introduces dynamic grasp synthesis, where a hand grasps and moves an object to a target pose. We approach this task using physical simulation and reinforcement learning. We then extend this to bimanual manipulation and articulated objects, requiring fine-grained coordination between hands. In the second part of this dissertation, we study human-to-robot handovers. We integrate captured human motion into simulation and introduce a student-teacher framework that adapts to human behavior and transfers from sim to real. To overcome data scarcity, we generate synthetic interactions, increasing training diversity by 100x. Our user study finds no difference between policies trained on synthetic vs. real motions.</p></details> | PhD Thesis |
| **[SonicSim: A customizable simulation platform for speech processing in moving sound source scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01481v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Systematic evaluation of speech separation and enhancement models under moving sound source conditions requires extensive and diverse data. However, real-world datasets often lack sufficient data for training and evaluation, and synthetic datasets, while larger, lack acoustic realism. Consequently, neither effectively meets practical needs. To address this issue, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit based on the embodied AI simulation platform Habitat-sim, designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim supports multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level adjustments, enabling the creation of more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a benchmark dataset called SonicSet, utilizing LibriSpeech, Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K), Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to investigate the differences between synthetic and real-world data, we selected 5 hours of raw, non-reverberant data from the SonicSet validation set and recorded a real-world speech separation dataset, providing a reference for comparing SonicSet with other synthetic datasets. For speech enhancement, we utilized the real-world dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between SonicSet and existing synthetic datasets. The results indicate that models trained on SonicSet generalize better to real-world scenarios compared to other synthetic datasets. The code is publicly available at https://cslikai.cn/SonicSim/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Vision-Language-Action Models for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14093v4)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI is widely recognized as a key element of artificial general intelligence because it involves controlling embodied agents to perform tasks in the physical world. Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. We have created a project associated with this survey, which is available at https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA</p></details> |
| **[WMNav: Integrating Vision-Language Models into World Models for Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02247v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object Goal Navigation-requiring an agent to locate a specific object in an unseen environment-remains a core challenge in embodied AI. Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

Powered by modern AI technologies such as multimodal large language models and world models, Embodied AI (EmAI) represents a transformative frontier, offering enhanced autonomy and the ability to interact with the physical world to address these challenges. As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research. Despite its promise, the development of EmAI for healthcare is hindered by critical challenges such as safety concerns, gaps between simulation platforms and real-world applications, the absence of standardized benchmarks, and uneven progress across interdisciplinary domains. We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development. By providing systematic insights, this work aims to inspire innovation and practical applications, paving the way for a new era of intelligent, patient-centered healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 11 figures, manuscript accepted by Information Fusion</p></details> |
| **[AffordGrasp: In-Context Affordance Reasoning for Open-Vocabulary Task-Oriented Grasping in Clutter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00778v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring the affordance of an object and grasping it in a task-oriented manner is crucial for robots to successfully complete manipulation tasks. Affordance indicates where and how to grasp an object by taking its functionality into account, serving as the foundation for effective task-oriented grasping. However, current task-oriented methods often depend on extensive training data that is confined to specific tasks and objects, making it difficult to generalize to novel objects and complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce AffordGrasp, a novel open-vocabulary grasping framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) for in-context affordance reasoning. Unlike existing methods that rely on explicit task and object specifications, our approach infers tasks directly from implicit user instructions, enabling more intuitive and seamless human-robot interaction in everyday scenarios. Building on the reasoning outcomes, our framework identifies task-relevant objects and grounds their part-level affordances using a visual grounding module. This allows us to generate task-oriented grasp poses precisely within the affordance regions of the object, ensuring both functional and context-aware robotic manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordGrasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of our method. We believe our approach advances robotic manipulation techniques and contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://eqcy.github.io/affordgrasp/.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPA: 3D Spatial-Awareness Enables Effective Embodied Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08208v3)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce SPA, a novel representation learning framework that emphasizes the importance of 3D spatial awareness in embodied AI. Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios.

Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, as frontier tasks in robotics get more advanced, they require faster simulation speed, more intricate test environments, and larger demonstration datasets. To this end, we present MS-HAB, a holistic benchmark for low-level manipulation and in-home object rearrangement. First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of prior magical grasp implementations at a fraction of the GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Code and data are available at https://github.com/wz0919/VLN-SRDF</p></details> |

These vulnerabilities manifest through sensor spoofing, adversarial attacks, and failures in task and motion planning, posing significant challenges to robustness and safety. Despite the growing body of research, existing reviews rarely focus specifically on the unique safety and security challenges of embodied AI systems. Most prior work either addresses general AI vulnerabilities or focuses on isolated aspects, lacking a dedicated and unified framework tailored to embodied AI. This survey fills this critical gap by: (1) categorizing vulnerabilities specific to embodied AI into exogenous (e.g., physical attacks, cybersecurity threats) and endogenous (e.g., sensor failures, software flaws) origins; (2) systematically analyzing adversarial attack paradigms unique to embodied AI, with a focus on their impact on perception, decision-making, and embodied interaction; (3) investigating attack vectors targeting large vision-language models (LVLMs) and large language models (LLMs) within embodied systems, such as jailbreak attacks and instruction misinterpretation; (4) evaluating robustness challenges in algorithms for embodied perception, decision-making, and task planning; and (5) proposing targeted strategies to enhance the safety and reliability of embodied AI systems. By integrating these dimensions, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between vulnerabilities and safety in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, the one-to-many nature of the image-to-3D problem limits their use due to inconsistent content and quality across views. Previous models optimize a 3D model by sampling views from a view-conditioned diffusion prior, but diffusion models cannot guarantee view consistency. Instead, we present ConsistentDreamer, where we first generate a set of fixed multi-view prior images and sample random views between them with another diffusion model through a score distillation sampling (SDS) loss. Thereby, we limit the discrepancies between the views guided by the SDS loss and ensure a consistent rough shape. In each iteration, we also use our generated multi-view prior images for fine-detail reconstruction. To balance between the rough shape and the fine-detail optimizations, we introduce dynamic task-dependent weights based on homoscedastic uncertainty, updated automatically in each iteration. Additionally, we employ opacity, depth distortion, and normal alignment losses to refine the surface for mesh extraction. Our method ensures better view consistency and visual quality compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Pattern Recognition Letters.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

To advance Spatial Artificial Intelligence, we pioneer a psychometric framework defining five Basic Spatial Abilities (BSAs) in Visual Language Models (VLMs): Spatial Perception, Spatial Relation, Spatial Orientation, Mental Rotation, and Spatial Visualization. Benchmarking 13 mainstream VLMs through nine validated psychometric experiments reveals significant gaps versus humans (average score 24.95 vs. 68.38), with three key findings: 1) VLMs mirror human hierarchies (strongest in 2D orientation, weakest in 3D rotation) with independent BSAs (Pearson's r<0.4); 2) Smaller models such as Qwen2-VL-7B surpass larger counterparts, with Qwen leading (30.82) and InternVL2 lagging (19.6); 3) Interventions like chain-of-thought (0.100 accuracy gain) and 5-shot training (0.259 improvement) show limits from architectural constraints. Identified barriers include weak geometry encoding and missing dynamic simulation. By linking psychometric BSAs to VLM capabilities, we provide a diagnostic toolkit for spatial intelligence evaluation, methodological foundations for embodied AI development, and a cognitive science-informed roadmap for achieving human-like spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, when powered by open LLMs, they struggle with basic tasks even after domain-specific fine-tuning. We present MindForge, a generative-agent framework for collaborative lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural interagent communication; and (3) a multicomponent memory system. In Minecraft experiments, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks where traditional Voyager fails without GPT-4, collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items and achieving $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones, advancing from basic wood tools to advanced iron equipment. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated collaborative experiences. MindForge advances the democratization of embodied AI development through open-ended social learning, enabling peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.</p></details> |  |

Despite successes in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for high-level traffic scene semantic understanding, it remains challenging to effectively translate these conceptual semantics understandings into low-level motion control commands and achieve generalization and consensus in cross-scene driving. We introduce Sce2DriveX, a human-like driving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning MLLM framework. Sce2DriveX utilizes multimodal joint learning from local scene videos and global BEV maps to deeply understand long-range spatiotemporal relationships and road topology, enhancing its comprehensive perception and reasoning capabilities in 3D dynamic/static scenes and achieving driving generalization across scenes. Building on this, it reconstructs the implicit cognitive chain inherent in human driving, covering scene understanding, meta-action reasoning, behavior interpretation analysis, motion planning and control, thereby further bridging the gap between autonomous driving and human thought processes. To elevate model performance, we have developed the first extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) driving instruction dataset tailored for 3D spatial understanding and long-axis task reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sce2DriveX achieves state-of-the-art performance from scene understanding to end-to-end driving, as well as robust generalization on the CARLA Bench2Drive benchmark.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances have enhanced the ability of VLMs to perceive object locations and positional relationships, they still lack the capability to precisely understand object orientations-a key requirement for tasks involving fine-grained manipulations. Addressing this limitation not only requires geometric reasoning but also an expressive and intuitive way to represent orientation. In this context, we propose that natural language offers a more flexible representation space than canonical frames, making it particularly suitable for instruction-following robotic systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic orientation, which defines object orientations using natural language in a reference-frame-free manner (e.g., the ''plug-in'' direction of a USB or the ''handle'' direction of a knife). To support this, we construct OrienText300K, a large-scale dataset of 3D models annotated with semantic orientations that link geometric understanding to functional semantics. By integrating semantic orientation into a VLM system, we enable robots to generate manipulation actions with both positional and orientational constraints. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances robotic manipulation capabilities, e.g., 48.7% accuracy on Open6DOR and 74.9% accuracy on SIMPLER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://qizekun.github.io/sofar/</p></details> |

Recent advances in foundation models pave the way for generative agents capable of richer communication and adaptive problem-solving. This survey provides a systematic examination of how EMAS can benefit from these generative capabilities. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes EMAS by system architectures and embodiment modalities, emphasizing how collaboration spans both physical and virtual contexts. Central building blocks, perception, planning, communication, and feedback, are then analyzed to illustrate how generative techniques bolster system robustness and flexibility. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate the transformative effects of integrating foundation models into embodied, multi-agent frameworks. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions, underlining the significant promise of EMAS to reshape the landscape of AI-driven collaboration.</p></details> | 18 pages |

We propose a novel object-centric latent action learning approach, based on VideoSaur and LAPO, that employs self-supervised decomposition of scenes into object representations and annotates video data with proxy-action labels. This method effectively disentangles causal agent-object interactions from irrelevant background noise and reduces the performance degradation of latent action learning approaches caused by distractors. Our preliminary experiments with the Distracting Control Suite show that latent action pretraining based on object decompositions improve the quality of inferred latent actions by x2.7 and efficiency of downstream fine-tuning with a small set of labeled actions, increasing return by x2.6 on average.</p></details> | Preprint.

| **[POEX: Understanding and Mitigating Policy Executable Jailbreak Attacks against Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16633v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems are rapidly evolving due to the integration of LLMs as planning modules, which transform complex instructions into executable policies. However, LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can generate malicious content. This paper investigates the feasibility and rationale behind applying traditional LLM jailbreak attacks to EAI systems. We aim to answer three questions: (1) Do traditional LLM jailbreak attacks apply to EAI systems? (2) What challenges arise if they do not? and (3) How can we defend against EAI jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first measure existing LLM-based EAI systems using a newly constructed dataset, i.e., the Harmful-RLbench. Our study confirms that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are not directly applicable to EAI systems and identifies two unique challenges. First, the harmful text does not necessarily constitute harmful policies. Second, even if harmful policies can be generated, they are not necessarily executable by the EAI systems, which limits the potential risk. To facilitate a more comprehensive security analysis, we refine and introduce POEX, a novel red teaming framework that optimizes adversarial suffixes to induce harmful yet executable policies against EAI systems. The design of POEX employs adversarial constraints, policy evaluators, and suffix optimization to ensure successful policy execution while evading safety detection inside an EAI system. Experiments on the real-world robotic arm and simulator using Harmful-RLbench demonstrate the efficacy, highlighting severe safety vulnerabilities and high transferability across models. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses, achieving an 85% success rate in mitigating attacks and enhancing safety awareness in EAI systems. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust security measures to ensure the safe deployment of EAI in critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://poex-eai-jailbreak.github.io/</p></details> |

These advancements have led to an explosive increase in the demand for computational power, challenging the limits of Moore's Law. Optical lithography, a critical technology in semiconductor manufacturing, faces significant challenges due to its high costs. To address this, various lithography simulators have been developed.

Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Due to the high density of visual features, especially in large 3D scenes, accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objects and consider their features as scene representations. However, these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems, we propose LSceneLLM, an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks, followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically, a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs, we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark, XR-Scene, which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA, XR-EmbodiedPlanning, and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.</p></details> |  |

Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) enables drones to locate objects based on natural language expressions, a crucial capability for Embodied AI. Despite advances in REC for ground-level scenes, aerial views introduce unique challenges including varying viewpoints, occlusions and scale variations. To address this gap, we introduce RefDrone, a REC benchmark for drone scenes. RefDrone reveals three key challenges in REC: 1) multi-scale and small-scale target detection; 2) multi-target and no-target samples; 3) complex environment with rich contextual expressions. To efficiently construct this dataset, we develop RDAgent (referring drone annotation framework with multi-agent system), a semi-automated annotation tool for REC tasks. RDAgent ensures high-quality contextual expressions and reduces annotation cost. Furthermore, we propose Number GroundingDINO (NGDINO), a novel method designed to handle multi-target and no-target cases. NGDINO explicitly learns and utilizes the number of objects referred to in the expression. Comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art REC methods demonstrate that NGDINO achieves superior performance on both the proposed RefDrone and the existing gRefCOCO datasets.

However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | Preprint.

We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |

This enhancement has reduced errors in mathematical and logical tasks while improving accuracy. These developments have facilitated LLMs' use as agents that can interact with tools and adapt their responses based on new information. Our study examines DeepSeek R1, a model trained to output reasoning tokens similar to OpenAI's o1. Testing revealed concerning behaviors: the model exhibited deceptive tendencies and demonstrated self-preservation instincts, including attempts of self-replication, despite these traits not being explicitly programmed (or prompted). These findings raise concerns about LLMs potentially masking their true objectives behind a facade of alignment. When integrating such LLMs into robotic systems, the risks become tangible - a physically embodied AI exhibiting deceptive behaviors and self-preservation instincts could pursue its hidden objectives through real-world actions.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 10,002 entries of interleaved video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world -- likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of embedded physical priors. To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4\% improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can help embodied agents such as MOKA.

Nevertheless, the rapid development of MEANETs is accompanied by challenges in trustworthiness and operational efficiency. Fortunately, blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable characteristics, offers promising solutions for MEANETs. However, existing block propagation mechanisms suffer from challenges such as low propagation efficiency and weak security for block propagation, which results in delayed transmission of vehicular messages or vulnerability to malicious tampering, potentially causing severe traffic accidents in blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Moreover, current block propagation strategies cannot effectively adapt to real-time changes of dynamic topology in MEANETs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a graph Resfusion model-based trustworthy block propagation optimization framework for consortium blockchain-enabled MEANETs. Specifically, we propose an innovative trust calculation mechanism based on the trust cloud model, which comprehensively accounts for randomness and fuzziness in the miner trust evaluation. Furthermore, by leveraging the strengths of graph neural networks and diffusion models, we develop a graph Resfusion model to effectively and adaptively generate the optimal block propagation trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other routing mechanisms in terms of block propagation efficiency and trustworthiness. Additionally, the results highlight its strong adaptability to dynamic environments, making it particularly suitable for rapidly changing MEANETs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |

Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development. We open-source all evaluation data and simulation framework at https://github.com/thunlp/EmbodiedEval.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. In summary, we demonstrate that GenEx provides a transformative platform for advancing embodied AI in imaginative spaces and brings potential for extending these capabilities to real-world exploration.</p></details> | Website: GenEx.world |

While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics which break down evaluation into various types of errors, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, various types of planning errors, etc. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems, and providing insights for effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at NeurIPS 2024 in the Datasets and Benchmarks track.

However, a standardized, closed-loop benchmark for evaluating their spatial reasoning and sequential decision-making capabilities is lacking. To address this, we present MetaVQA: a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess and enhance VLMs' understanding of spatial relationships and scene dynamics through Visual Question Answering (VQA) and closed-loop simulations. MetaVQA leverages Set-of-Mark prompting and top-down view ground-truth annotations from nuScenes and Waymo datasets to automatically generate extensive question-answer pairs based on diverse real-world traffic scenarios, ensuring object-centric and context-rich instructions. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with the MetaVQA dataset significantly improves their spatial reasoning and embodied scene comprehension in safety-critical simulations, evident not only in improved VQA accuracies but also in emerging safety-aware driving maneuvers. In addition, the learning demonstrates strong transferability from simulation to real-world observation.

However, many sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, demand AI systems capable of extending their intelligence into the physical world, interacting directly with objects, environments, and dynamic conditions. This need has led to the emergence of Physical AI Agents--systems that integrate cognitive reasoning, powered by specialized LLMs, with precise physical actions to perform real-world tasks. This work introduces Physical AI Agents as an evolution of shared principles with Vertical AI Agents, tailored for physical interaction. We propose a modular architecture with three core blocks--perception, cognition, and actuation--offering a scalable framework for diverse industries. Additionally, we present the Physical Retrieval Augmented Generation (Ph-RAG) design pattern, which connects physical intelligence to industry-specific LLMs for real-time decision-making and reporting informed by physical context. Through case studies, we demonstrate how Physical AI Agents and the Ph-RAG framework are transforming industries like autonomous vehicles, warehouse robotics, healthcare, and manufacturing, offering businesses a pathway to integrate embodied AI for operational efficiency and innovation.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |

Detection and Localization of Instruction Errors in Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10700v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is one of the most intuitive yet challenging embodied AI tasks. Agents are tasked to navigate towards a target goal by executing a set of low-level actions, following a series of natural language instructions. All VLN-CE methods in the literature assume that language instructions are exact. However, in practice, instructions given by humans can contain errors when describing a spatial environment due to inaccurate memory or confusion. Current VLN-CE benchmarks do not address this scenario, making the state-of-the-art methods in VLN-CE fragile in the presence of erroneous instructions from human users. For the first time, we propose a novel benchmark dataset that introduces various types of instruction errors considering potential human causes. This benchmark provides valuable insight into the robustness of VLN systems in continuous environments. We observe a noticeable performance drop (up to -25%) in Success Rate when evaluating the state-of-the-art VLN-CE methods on our benchmark. Moreover, we formally define the task of Instruction Error Detection and Localization, and establish an evaluation protocol on top of our benchmark dataset. We also propose an effective method, based on a cross-modal transformer architecture, that achieves the best performance in error detection and localization, compared to baselines. Surprisingly, our proposed method has revealed errors in the validation set of the two commonly used datasets for VLN-CE, i.e., R2R-CE and RxR-CE, demonstrating the utility of our technique in other tasks.

However, tasks such as object search have largely focused on efficient policy learning. In this work, we identify several gaps in current search methods: They largely focus on dated perception models, neglect temporal aggregation, and transfer from ground truth directly to noisy perception at test time, without accounting for the resulting overconfidence in the perceived state. We address the identified problems through calibrated perception probabilities and uncertainty across aggregation and found decisions, thereby adapting the models for sequential tasks. The resulting methods can be directly integrated with pretrained models across a wide family of existing search approaches at no additional training cost. We perform extensive evaluations of aggregation methods across both different semantic perception models and policies, confirming the importance of calibrated uncertainties in both the aggregation and found decisions. We make the code and trained models available at https://semantic-search.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior studies that explored this as long-form video understanding and utilized egocentric video only, we instead propose an LLM-based agent, Embodied VideoAgent, which constructs scene memory from both egocentric video and embodied sensory inputs (e.g. depth and pose sensing). We further introduce a VLM-based approach to automatically update the memory when actions or activities over objects are perceived. Embodied VideoAgent attains significant advantages over counterparts in challenging reasoning and planning tasks in 3D scenes, achieving gains of 4.9% on Ego4D-VQ3D, 5.8% on OpenEQA, and 11.7% on EnvQA.

Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p></details> | accepted to AAAI2025 |

Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages with 5 figures and 11 tables</p></details> |

The proposed framework aims to optimize both data transmission efficiency and decision accuracy by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates the Weber-Fechner law, serving as a metric for balancing bandwidth utilization and quality of experience (QoE). Specifically, we employ the large language and vision assistant (LLAVA) model to extract critical semantic information from raw image data captured by embodied AI agents (i.e., vehicles), reducing transmission data size by approximately more than 90\% while retaining essential content for vehicular communication and decision-making. In the dynamic vehicular environment, we employ a generalized advantage estimation-based proximal policy optimization (GAE-PPO) method to stabilize decision-making under uncertainty. Simulation results show that attention maps from LLAVA highlight the model's focus on relevant image regions, enhancing semantic representation accuracy. Additionally, our proposed transmission strategy improves QoE by up to 36\% compared to DDPG and accelerates convergence by reducing required steps by up to 47\% compared to pure PPO. Further analysis indicates that adapting semantic symbol length provides an effective trade-off between transmission quality and bandwidth, achieving up to a 61.4\% improvement in QoE when scaling from 4 to 8 vehicles.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

However, for robot-generated content (RGC), will its image quality be consistent with the Moravec paradox and counter to human common sense? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we first propose an embodied image quality assessment (EIQA) frameworks. We establish assessment metrics for input images based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, we construct an Embodied Preference Database (EPD) containing 5,000 reference and distorted image annotations. The performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is finally verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment.

However, LAE also faces challenges in data collection and processing efficiency, flight control precision, and network performance. The challenges could be solved by realizing an integration of sensing, communications, computation, and control (ISC3) for LAE. In this regard, embodied artificial intelligence (EAI), with its unique perception, planning, and decision-making capabilities, offers a promising solution to realize ISC3. Specifically, this paper investigates an application of EAI into ISC3 to support LAE, exploring potential research focuses, solutions, and case study. We begin by outlining rationales and benefits of introducing EAI into LAE, followed by reviewing research directions and solutions for EAI in ISC3. We then propose a framework of an EAI-enabled ISC3 for LAE. The framework's effectiveness is evaluated through a case study of express delivery utilizing an EAI-enabled UAV. Finally, we discuss several future research directions for advancing EAI-enabled LAE.</p></details> |  |

While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve-1), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods. We will release our code and demos on the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/mr-steve.</p></details> |  |

Our GameFi ecosystem aims to fundamentally transform this landscape by integrating advanced embodied AI agents into GameFi platforms. These AI agents, developed using cutting-edge large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Claude AI, are capable of proactive, adaptive, and contextually rich interactions with players. By going beyond traditional scripted responses, these agents become integral participants in the game's narrative and economic systems, directly influencing player strategies and in-game economies. We address the limitations of current GameFi platforms, which often lack immersive AI interactions and mechanisms for community engagement or creator monetization. Through the deep integration of AI agents with blockchain technology, we establish a consensus-driven, decentralized GameFi ecosystem. This ecosystem empowers creators to monetize their contributions and fosters democratic collaboration among players and creators. Furthermore, by embedding DeFi mechanisms into the gaming experience, we enhance economic participation and provide new opportunities for financial interactions within the game. Our approach enhances player immersion and retention and advances the GameFi ecosystem by bridging traditional gaming with Web3 technologies. By integrating sophisticated AI and DeFi elements, we contribute to the development of more engaging, economically robust, and community-centric gaming environments.

While existing methods can synthesize realistic human motions in 3D scenes and generate plausible human-object interactions, they heavily rely on datasets containing paired 3D scene and motion capture data, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect across diverse environments and interactions. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis by integrating video generation and neural human rendering. Our key insight is to leverage the rich motion priors learned by state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/</p></details> |

Despite significant progress in handling complex environments using deep reinforcement learning, current PGN methods are designed for single-robot systems, limiting their generalizability to multi-robot scenarios with diverse platforms. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a knowledge transfer framework for PGN, allowing a teacher robot to transfer its learned navigation model to student robots, including those with unknown or black-box platforms. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework that transfers first-person-view (FPV) representations (view images, turning/forward actions) to universally applicable third-person-view (TPV) representations (local maps, subgoals). The state is redefined as reconstructed local maps using SLAM, while actions are mapped to subgoals on a predefined grid. To enhance training efficiency, we propose a sampling-efficient KD approach that aligns training episodes via a noise-robust local map descriptor (LMD). Although validated on 2D wheeled robots, this method can be extended to 3D action spaces, such as drones. Experiments conducted in Habitat-Sim demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, requiring minimal implementation effort. This study highlights the potential for scalable and cross-platform PGN solutions, expanding the applicability of embodied AI systems in multi-robot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper: 5 pages with 2 figures</p></details> |

However, due to the lack of comprehensive 3D benchmarks, the capabilities of 3D models in real-world scenes, particularly those that are challenging with subtly distinguished objects, remain insufficiently investigated. To facilitate a more thorough evaluation of 3D models' capabilities, we propose a scheme, ObjVariantEnsemble, to systematically introduce more scenes with specified object classes, colors, shapes, quantities, and spatial relationships to meet model evaluation needs. More importantly, we intentionally construct scenes with similar objects to a certain degree and design an LLM-VLM-cooperated annotator to capture key distinctions as annotations. The resultant benchmark can better challenge 3D models, reveal their shortcomings in understanding, and potentially aid in the further development of 3D models.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |

The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</p></details> |  |

However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |

However, current robots struggle to fully and accurately interpret human intentions from voice commands alone. Traditional gripper and suction systems often fail to interact naturally with humans, lack advanced manipulation capabilities, and are not adaptable to diverse tasks, especially in unstructured environments. This paper introduces the Embodied Dexterous Grasping System (EDGS), designed to tackle object grasping in cluttered environments for human-robot interaction. We propose a novel approach to semantic-object alignment using a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that fuses voice commands and visual information, significantly enhancing the alignment of multi-dimensional attributes of target objects in complex scenarios. Inspired by human hand-object interactions, we develop a robust, precise, and efficient grasping strategy, incorporating principles like the thumb-object axis, multi-finger wrapping, and fingertip interaction with an object's contact mechanics. We also design experiments to assess Referring Expression Representation Enrichment (RERE) in referring expression segmentation, demonstrating that our system accurately detects and matches referring expressions. Extensive experiments confirm that EDGS can effectively handle complex grasping tasks, achieving stability and high success rates, highlighting its potential for further development in the field of Embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, our focus lies in areas such as Embodied AI, Games, UI Control, and Planning. To this end, we introduce a process of adapting an MLLM to a Generalist Embodied Agent (GEA). GEA is a single unified model capable of grounding itself across these varied domains through a multi-embodiment action tokenizer. GEA is trained with supervised learning on a large dataset of embodied experiences and with online RL in interactive simulators. We explore the data and algorithmic choices necessary to develop such a model. Our findings reveal the importance of training with cross-domain data and online RL for building generalist agents. The final GEA model achieves strong generalization performance to unseen tasks across diverse benchmarks compared to other generalist models and benchmark-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |

The central case study is Jess+ an intelligent digital score system for shared creativity with a mixed ensemble of non-disabled and disabled musicians. The overarching aim is that the digital score enables disabled musicians to thrive in a live music conversation with other musicians regardless of the potential barriers of disability and music-making. After defining what we mean by embodied AI and how this approach supports the aims of the Jess+ project, we outline the main design features of the system. This includes several novel approaches such as its modular design, an AI Factory based on an embodied musicking dataset, and an embedded belief system. Our findings showed that the implemented design decisions and embodied-AI approach led to rich experiences for the musicians which in turn transformed their practice as an inclusive ensemble.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models in Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07904v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated a wide range of capabilities across many domains, including Embodied AI. In this work, we study how to best ground a MLLM into different embodiments and their associated action spaces, with the goal of leveraging the multimodal world knowledge of the MLLM. We first generalize a number of methods through a unified architecture and the lens of action space adaptors. For continuous actions, we show that a learned tokenization allows for sufficient modeling precision, yielding the best performance on downstream tasks. For discrete actions, we demonstrate that semantically aligning these actions with the native output token space of the MLLM leads to the strongest performance. We arrive at these lessons via a thorough study of seven action space adapters on five different environments, encompassing over 114 embodied tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, previous work has been scattered across diverse simulation platforms, with assets and models lacking unified interfaces, which has led to inefficiencies in research. To address this, we introduce InfiniteWorld, a unified and scalable simulator for general vision-language robot interaction built on Nvidia Isaac Sim. InfiniteWorld encompasses a comprehensive set of physics asset construction methods and generalized free robot interaction benchmarks. Specifically, we first built a unified and scalable simulation framework for embodied learning that integrates a series of improvements in generation-driven 3D asset construction, Real2Sim, automated annotation framework, and unified 3D asset processing. This framework provides a unified and scalable platform for robot interaction and learning. In addition, to simulate realistic robot interaction, we build four new general benchmarks, including scene graph collaborative exploration and open-world social mobile manipulation. The former is often overlooked as an important task for robots to explore the environment and build scene knowledge, while the latter simulates robot interaction tasks with different levels of knowledge agents based on the former. They can more comprehensively evaluate the embodied agent's capabilities in environmental understanding, task planning and execution, and intelligent interaction. We hope that this work can provide the community with a systematic asset interface, alleviate the dilemma of the lack of high-quality assets, and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of robot interactions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

This study finds that state-of-the-art embodied AI agents compete for higher navigation quality, but often compromise the computational efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce "Skip-SCAR," an optimization framework that builds computationally and memory-efficient embodied AI agents to accomplish high-quality visual navigation tasks. Skip-SCAR opportunistically skips the redundant step computations during semantic segmentation and local re-planning without hurting the navigation quality. Skip-SCAR also adopts a novel hybrid sparse and dense network for object prediction, optimizing both the computation and memory footprint. Tested on the HM3D ObjectNav datasets and real-world physical hardware systems, Skip-SCAR not only minimizes hardware resources but also sets new performance benchmarks, demonstrating the benefits of optimizing both navigation quality and computational efficiency for robotics.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Privacy Risks in Reinforcement Learning for Household Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09273v3)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prominence of embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI), which empowers robots to navigate, perceive, and engage within virtual environments, has attracted significant attention, owing to the remarkable advances in computer vision and large language models. Privacy emerges as a pivotal concern within the realm of embodied AI, as the robot accesses substantial personal information. However, the issue of privacy leakage in embodied AI tasks, particularly concerning reinforcement learning algorithms, has not received adequate consideration in research. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing an attack on the training process of the value-based algorithm and the gradient-based algorithm, utilizing gradient inversion to reconstruct states, actions, and supervisory signals. The choice of using gradients for the attack is motivated by the fact that commonly employed federated learning techniques solely utilize gradients computed based on private user data to optimize models, without storing or transmitting the data to public servers. Nevertheless, these gradients contain sufficient information to potentially expose private data. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on the AI2THOR simulator and evaluated our algorithm on active perception, a prevalent task in embodied AI. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in successfully reconstructing all information from the data in 120 room layouts.

In this paper, we propose TANGO, an approach that extends the program composition via LLMs already observed for images, aiming to integrate those capabilities into embodied agents capable of observing and acting in the world. Specifically, by employing a simple PointGoal Navigation model combined with a memory-based exploration policy as a foundational primitive for guiding an agent through the world, we show how a single model can address diverse tasks without additional training. We task an LLM with composing the provided primitives to solve a specific task, using only a few in-context examples in the prompt. We evaluate our approach on three key Embodied AI tasks: Open-Set ObjectGoal Navigation, Multi-Modal Lifelong Navigation, and Open Embodied Question Answering, achieving state-of-the-art results without any specific fine-tuning in challenging zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functionality understanding and segmentation in 3D scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16310v3)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding functionalities in 3D scenes involves interpreting natural language descriptions to locate functional interactive objects, such as handles and buttons, in a 3D environment. Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

Despite recent advancements in Neural Implicit Representations (NIR), existing methods often lack editability and compositional flexibility, limiting their use in scenarios requiring high interactivity and object-level manipulation. In this paper, we introduce the Gaussian Object Carver (GOC), a novel, efficient, and scalable framework for object-compositional 3D scene reconstruction. GOC leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), enriched with monocular geometry priors and multi-view geometry regularization, to achieve high-quality and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a zero-shot Object Surface Completion (OSC) model, which uses 3D priors from 3d object data to reconstruct unobserved surfaces, ensuring object completeness even in occluded areas. Experimental results demonstrate that GOC improves reconstruction efficiency and geometric fidelity. It holds promise for advancing the practical application of digital twins in embodied AI, AR/VR, and interactive simulation environments.</p></details> |  |

Many LLM-based planners are inefficient due to their large number of parameters and prone to inaccuracies because they operate in open-loop systems. We think the reason is that only applying LLMs as planners is insufficient. In this work, we propose DaDu-E, a robust closed-loop planning framework for embodied AI robots. Specifically, DaDu-E is equipped with a relatively lightweight LLM, a set of encapsulated robot skill instructions, a robust feedback system, and memory augmentation. Together, these components enable DaDu-E to (i) actively perceive and adapt to dynamic environments, (ii) optimize computational costs while maintaining high performance, and (iii) recover from execution failures using its memory and feedback mechanisms. Extensive experiments on real-world and simulated tasks show that DaDu-E achieves task success rates comparable to embodied AI robots with larger models as planners like COME-Robot, while reducing computational requirements by $6.6 \times$.

Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered by current works. In this work, we address this shortcoming and introduce (1) an expertly curated dataset in the Universal Scene Description (USD) format, featuring high-quality manual annotations, for instance, segmentation and articulation on 280 indoor scenes; (2) a learning-based model together with a novel baseline capable of predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes, including motion type, articulated and interactable parts, and motion parameters; (3) a benchmark serving to compare upcoming methods for the task at hand. Overall, our dataset provides 8 types of annotations - object and part segmentations, motion types, movable and interactable parts, motion parameters, connectivity, and object mass annotations. With its broad and high-quality annotations, the data provides the basis for holistic 3D scene understanding models. All data is provided in the USD format, allowing interoperability and easy integration with downstream tasks. We provide open access to our dataset, benchmark, and method's source code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Reward and Policy Jointly from Demonstration and Preference Improves Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06874v3)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for building contemporary foundation models and embodied AI. However, popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) break down the task into successive stages, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling (RM), and reinforcement learning (RL), each performing one specific learning task. Such a sequential approach results in serious issues such as significant under-utilization of data and distribution mismatch between the learned reward model and generated policy, which eventually lead to poor alignment performance. We develop a single stage approach named Alignment with Integrated Human Feedback (AIHF), capable of integrating both human preference and demonstration to train reward models and the policy. The proposed approach admits a suite of efficient algorithms, which can easily reduce to, and leverage, popular alignment algorithms such as RLHF and Directly Policy Optimization (DPO), and only requires minor changes to the existing alignment pipelines. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solutions with extensive experiments involving alignment problems in LLMs and robotic control problems in MuJoCo. We observe that the proposed solutions outperform the existing alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO by large margins, especially when the amount of high-quality preference data is relatively limited.</p></details> |  |
| **[EARBench: Towards Evaluating Physical Risk Awareness for Task Planning of Foundation Model-based Embodied AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04449v5)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied artificial intelligence (EAI) integrates advanced AI models into physical entities for real-world interaction. The emergence of foundation models as the "brain" of EAI agents for high-level task planning has shown promising results. However, the deployment of these agents in physical environments presents significant safety challenges. For instance, a housekeeping robot lacking sufficient risk awareness might place a metal container in a microwave, potentially causing a fire. To address these critical safety concerns, comprehensive pre-deployment risk assessments are imperative. This study introduces EARBench, a novel framework for automated physical risk assessment in EAI scenarios. EAIRiskBench employs a multi-agent cooperative system that leverages various foundation models to generate safety guidelines, create risk-prone scenarios, make task planning, and evaluate safety systematically. Utilizing this framework, we construct EARDataset, comprising diverse test cases across various domains, encompassing both textual and visual scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art foundation models reveals alarming results: all models exhibit high task risk rates (TRR), with an average of 95.75% across all evaluated models. To address these challenges, we further propose two prompting-based risk mitigation strategies. While these strategies demonstrate some efficacy in reducing TRR, the improvements are limited, still indicating substantial safety concerns. This study provides the first large-scale assessment of physical risk awareness in EAI agents. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced safety measures in EAI systems and provide valuable insights for future research directions in developing safer embodied artificial intelligence system.

However, for sequential decision-making problems, such as robotics, action-labelled data is often scarce and therefore scaling-up foundation models for decision-making remains a challenge. A potential solution lies in leveraging widely-available unlabelled videos to train world models that simulate the consequences of actions. If the world model is accurate, it can be used to optimize decision-making in downstream tasks. Image-to-video diffusion models are already capable of generating highly realistic synthetic videos. However, these models are not action-conditioned, and the most powerful models are closed-source which means they cannot be finetuned. In this work, we propose to adapt pretrained video diffusion models to action-conditioned world models, without access to the parameters of the pretrained model. Our approach, AVID, trains an adapter on a small domain-specific dataset of action-labelled videos. AVID uses a learned mask to modify the intermediate outputs of the pretrained model and generate accurate action-conditioned videos. We evaluate AVID on video game and real-world robotics data, and show that it outperforms existing baselines for diffusion model adaptation.1 Our results demonstrate that if utilized correctly, pretrained video models have the potential to be powerful tools for embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/avid-world-model-adapters/home</p></details> |

In this study, we introduce ROOT, a VLM-based system designed to enhance the analysis of indoor scenes. Specifically, we first develop an iterative object perception algorithm using GPT-4V to detect object entities within indoor scenes. This is followed by employing vision foundation models to acquire additional meta-information about the scene, such as bounding boxes. Building on this foundational data, we propose a specialized VLM, SceneVLM, which is capable of generating spatial hierarchical scene graphs and providing distance information for objects within indoor environments. This information enhances our understanding of the spatial arrangement of indoor scenes. To train our SceneVLM, we collect over 610,000 images from various public indoor datasets and implement a scene data generation pipeline with a semi-automated technique to establish relationships and estimate distances among indoor objects. By utilizing this enriched data, we conduct various training recipes and finish SceneVLM. Our experiments demonstrate that \rootname facilitates indoor scene understanding and proves effective in diverse downstream applications, such as 3D scene generation and embodied AI. The code will be released at \url{https://github.com/harrytea/ROOT}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs and 3D segmentation masks. In addition, we design MORE3D, a simple yet effective method that enables multi-object 3D reasoning segmentation with user questions and textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation.

A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |

However, existing datasets and benchmarks for situated understanding are limited in data modality, diversity, scale, and task scope. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-modal Situated Question Answering (MSQA), a large-scale multi-modal situated reasoning dataset, scalably collected leveraging 3D scene graphs and vision-language models (VLMs) across a diverse range of real-world 3D scenes. MSQA includes 251K situated question-answering pairs across 9 distinct question categories, covering complex scenarios within 3D scenes. We introduce a novel interleaved multi-modal input setting in our benchmark to provide text, image, and point cloud for situation and question description, resolving ambiguity in previous single-modality convention (e.g., text). Additionally, we devise the Multi-modal Situated Next-step Navigation (MSNN) benchmark to evaluate models' situated reasoning for navigation. Comprehensive evaluations on MSQA and MSNN highlight the limitations of existing vision-language models and underscore the importance of handling multi-modal interleaved inputs and situation modeling. Experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer further demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging MSQA as a pre-training dataset for developing more powerful situated reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame-basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes Corki, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI robot control. Our idea is to decouple LLM inference, robotic control and data communication in the embodied AI robots compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, Corki predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. Corki largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to 8.0x, resulting in up to 3.6x speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 17.3%. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/hyy0613/Corki</p></details> |  |

Generated models frequently fail to maintain balance when placed in physics-based simulations or 3D printed. This balance is crucial for satisfying user design intentions in interactive gaming, embodied AI, and robotics, where stable models are needed for reliable interaction. Additionally, stable models ensure that 3D-printed objects, such as figurines for home decoration, can stand on their own without requiring additional supports. To fill this gap, we introduce Atlas3D, an automatic and easy-to-implement method that enhances existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based text-to-3D tools. Atlas3D ensures the generation of self-supporting 3D models that adhere to physical laws of stability under gravity, contact, and friction. Our approach combines a novel differentiable simulation-based loss function with physically inspired regularization, serving as either a refinement or a post-processing module for existing frameworks. We verify Atlas3D's efficacy through extensive generation tasks and validate the resulting 3D models in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yunuoch.github.io/Atlas3D/</p></details> |

Current methods, including manual design, procedural generation, diffusion-based scene generation, and large language model (LLM) guided scene design, are hindered by limitations such as excessive human effort, reliance on predefined rules or training datasets, and limited 3D spatial reasoning ability. Since pre-trained 2D image generative models better capture scene and object configuration than LLMs, we address these challenges by introducing Architect, a generative framework that creates complex and realistic 3D embodied environments leveraging diffusion-based 2D image inpainting. In detail, we utilize foundation visual perception models to obtain each generated object from the image and leverage pre-trained depth estimation models to lift the generated 2D image to 3D space. Our pipeline is further extended to a hierarchical and iterative inpainting process to continuously generate placement of large furniture and small objects to enrich the scene. This iterative structure brings the flexibility for our method to generate or refine scenes from various starting points, such as text, floor plans, or pre-arranged environments.</p></details> |  |

Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, \textit{i.e.}, pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the strategy of representation. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multi-faceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multi-modal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions. We have also set up a Github repository to organize the papers included in this survey at: \url{https://github.com/ChaofanTao/Autoregressive-Models-in-Vision-Survey}.</p></details> |  |

Scene Retrieval with Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14565v2)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language interfaces to embodied AI are becoming more ubiquitous in our daily lives. This opens up further opportunities for language-based interaction with embodied agents, such as a user verbally instructing an agent to execute some task in a specific location. For example, "put the bowls back in the cupboard next to the fridge" or "meet me at the intersection under the red sign." As such, we need methods that interface between natural language and map representations of the environment. To this end, we explore the question of whether we can use an open-set natural language query to identify a scene represented by a 3D scene graph. We define this task as "language-based scene-retrieval" and it is closely related to "coarse-localization," but we are instead searching for a match from a collection of disjoint scenes and not necessarily a large-scale continuous map.

| **[Unified Human-Scene Interaction via Prompted Chain-of-Contacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07918v5)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) is a vital component of fields like embodied AI and virtual reality. Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes.

| **[3D Audio-Visual Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02236v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing the sounding objects in scenes is a longstanding objective in embodied AI, with diverse applications in robotics and AR/VR/MR. To that end, Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS), taking as condition an audio signal to identify the masks of the target sounding objects in an input image with synchronous camera and microphone sensors, has been recently advanced. However, this paradigm is still insufficient for real-world operation, as the mapping from 2D images to 3D scenes is missing. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel research problem, 3D Audio-Visual Segmentation, extending the existing AVS to the 3D output space. This problem poses more challenges due to variations in camera extrinsics, audio scattering, occlusions, and diverse acoustics across sounding object categories. To facilitate this research, we create the very first simulation based benchmark, 3DAVS-S34-O7, providing photorealistic 3D scene environments with grounded spatial audio under single-instance and multi-instance settings, across 34 scenes and 7 object categories. This is made possible by re-purposing the Habitat simulator to generate comprehensive annotations of sounding object locations and corresponding 3D masks. Subsequently, we propose a new approach, EchoSegnet, characterized by integrating the ready-to-use knowledge from pretrained 2D audio-visual foundation models synergistically with 3D visual scene representation through spatial audio-aware mask alignment and refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoSegnet can effectively segment sounding objects in 3D space on our new benchmark, representing a significant advancement in the field of embodied AI.

However, current VLN frameworks often rely on static environments and optimal expert supervision, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we introduce Human-Aware Vision-and-Language Navigation (HA-VLN), extending traditional VLN by incorporating dynamic human activities and relaxing key assumptions. We propose the Human-Aware 3D (HA3D) simulator, which combines dynamic human activities with the Matterport3D dataset, and the Human-Aware Room-to-Room (HA-R2R) dataset, extending R2R with human activity descriptions. To tackle HA-VLN challenges, we present the Expert-Supervised Cross-Modal (VLN-CM) and Non-Expert-Supervised Decision Transformer (VLN-DT) agents, utilizing cross-modal fusion and diverse training strategies for effective navigation in dynamic human environments. A comprehensive evaluation, including metrics considering human activities, and systematic analysis of HA-VLN's unique challenges, underscores the need for further research to enhance HA-VLN agents' real-world robustness and adaptability. Ultimately, this work provides benchmarks and insights for future research on embodied AI and Sim2Real transfer, paving the way for more realistic and applicable VLN systems in human-populated environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spotl...</summary><p>Spotlight at NeurIPS 2024 D&B Track. 32 pages, 18 figures, Project Page: https://lpercc.github.io/HA3D_simulator/</p></details> |

Our system is modular: it deploys state of the art Large Language Models for task planning,Vision-Language models for semantic perception, and Point Cloud transformers for grasping. With semantic and physical safety in mind, these modules are interfaced with a real-time trajectory optimizer and a compliant tracking controller to enable human-robot proximity. We demonstrate performance for the following tasks: bi-arm sorting, bottle opening, and trash disposal tasks. These are done zero-shot where the models used have not been trained with any real world data from this bi-arm robot, scenes or workspace. Composing both learning- and non-learning-based components in a modular fashion with interpretable inputs and outputs allows the user to easily debug points of failures and fragilities. One may also in-place swap modules to improve the robustness of the overall platform, for instance with imitation-learned policies.

At present, many evaluation platforms with rich scenes, high visual fidelity and various application scenarios have been developed. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework named NeuronsGym that can be used for policy learning of robot tasks, covering a simulation platform for training policy, and a physical system for studying sim2real problems. Unlike most current single-task, slow-moving robotic platforms, our framework provides agile physical robots with a wider range of speeds, and can be employed to train robotic navigation and confrontation policies. At the same time, in order to evaluate the safety of robot navigation, we propose a safety-weighted path length (SFPL) to improve the safety evaluation in the current mobile robot navigation. Based on this platform, we build a new benchmark for navigation and confrontation tasks under this platform by comparing the current mainstream sim2real methods, and hold the 2022 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG) RoboMaster sim2real challenge. We release the codes of this framework\footnote{\url{https://github.com/DRL-CASIA/NeuronsGym}} and hope that this platform can promote the development of more flexible and agile general mobile agent algorithms.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[EnvBridge: Bridging Diverse Environments with Cross-Environment Knowledge Transfer for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16919v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated high reasoning capabilities, drawing attention for their applications as agents in various decision-making processes. One notably promising application of LLM agents is robotic manipulation. Recent research has shown that LLMs can generate text planning or control code for robots, providing substantial flexibility and interaction capabilities. However, these methods still face challenges in terms of flexibility and applicability across different environments, limiting their ability to adapt autonomously. Current approaches typically fall into two categories: those relying on environment-specific policy training, which restricts their transferability, and those generating code actions based on fixed prompts, which leads to diminished performance when confronted with new environments. These limitations significantly constrain the generalizability of agents in robotic manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called EnvBridge. This approach involves the retention and transfer of successful robot control codes from source environments to target environments. EnvBridge enhances the agent's adaptability and performance across diverse settings by leveraging insights from multiple environments. Notably, our approach alleviates environmental constraints, offering a more flexible and generalizable solution for robotic manipulation tasks. We validated the effectiveness of our method using robotic manipulation benchmarks: RLBench, MetaWorld, and CALVIN. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM agents can successfully leverage diverse knowledge sources to solve complex tasks. Consequently, our approach significantly enhances the adaptability and robustness of robotic manipulation agents in planning across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

However, key technical details of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are concealed (such as in OpenAI o1 blog and DeepSeek R1 technical report), thus the community still struggles to reproduce their RL training results. We propose the $\textbf{D}$ecoupled Clip and $\textbf{D}$ynamic s$\textbf{A}$mpling $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{DAPO}$) algorithm, and fully open-source a state-of-the-art large-scale RL system that achieves 50 points on AIME 2024 using Qwen2.5-32B base model. Unlike previous works that withhold training details, we introduce four key techniques of our algorithm that make large-scale LLM RL a success. In addition, we open-source our training code, which is built on the verl framework, along with a carefully curated and processed dataset. These components of our open-source system enhance reproducibility and support future research in large-scale LLM RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://dapo-sia.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Pauli Network Circuit Synthesis with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14448v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based method for re-synthesis of quantum circuits containing arbitrary Pauli rotations alongside Clifford operations. By collapsing each sub-block to a compact representation and then synthesizing it step-by-step through a learned heuristic, we obtain circuits that are both shorter and compliant with hardware connectivity constraints. We find that the method is fast enough and good enough to work as an optimization procedure: in direct comparisons on 6-qubit random Pauli Networks against state-of-the-art heuristic methods, our RL approach yields over 2x reduction in two-qubit gate count, while executing in under 10 milliseconds per circuit. We further integrate the method into a collect-and-re-synthesize pipeline, applied as a Qiskit transpiler pass, where we observe average improvements of 20% in two-qubit gate count and depth, reaching up to 60% for many instances, across the Benchpress benchmark. These results highlight the potential of RL-driven synthesis to significantly improve circuit quality in realistic, large-scale quantum transpilation workloads.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsynchronized Decentralized Q-Learning: Two Timescale Analysis By Persistence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03239v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-stationarity is a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where agents update their behaviour as they learn. Many theoretical advances in MARL avoid the challenge of non-stationarity by coordinating the policy updates of agents in various ways, including synchronizing times at which agents are allowed to revise their policies. Synchronization enables analysis of many MARL algorithms via multi-timescale methods, but such synchronization is infeasible in many decentralized applications. In this paper, we study an unsynchronized variant of the decentralized Q-learning algorithm, a recent MARL algorithm for stochastic games. We provide sufficient conditions under which the unsynchronized algorithm drives play to equilibrium with high probability. Our solution utilizes constant learning rates in the Q-factor update, which we show to be critical for relaxing the synchronization assumptions of earlier work. Our analysis also applies to unsynchronized generalizations of a number of other algorithms from the regret testing tradition, whose performance is analyzed by multi-timescale methods that study Markov chains obtained via policy update dynamics. This work extends the applicability of the decentralized Q-learning algorithm and its relatives to settings in which parameters are selected in an independent manner, and tames non-stationarity without imposing the coordination assumptions of prior work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization</p></details> |
| **[A Graph-Enhanced Deep-Reinforcement Learning Framework for the Aircraft Landing Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12617v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Aircraft Landing Problem (ALP) is one of the challenging problems in aircraft transportation and management. The challenge is to schedule the arriving aircraft in a sequence so that the cost and delays are optimized. There are various solution approaches to solving this problem, most of which are based on operations research algorithms and meta-heuristics. Although traditional methods perform better on one or the other factors, there remains a problem of solving real-time rescheduling and computational scalability altogether. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines graph neural networks with actor-critic architectures to address the ALP. This paper introduces three key contributions: A graph-based state representation that efficiently captures temporal and spatial relationships between aircraft, a specialized actor-critic architecture designed to handle multiple competing objectives in landing scheduling, and a runway balance strategy that ensures efficient resource utilization while maintaining safety constraints. The results show that the trained algorithm can be tested on different problem sets and the results are competitive to operation research algorithms. The experimental results on standard benchmark data sets demonstrate a 99.95% reduction in computational time compared to Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) and 38% higher runway throughput over First Come First Serve (FCFS) approaches. Therefore, the proposed solution is competitive to traditional approaches and achieves substantial advancements. Notably, it does not require retraining, making it particularly suitable for industrial deployment. The frameworks capability to generate solutions within 1 second enables real-time rescheduling, addressing critical requirements of air traffic management.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, submitted to ESWA, comments are welcome</p></details> |

However, acquiring diverse food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g., color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance. We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition. Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy based on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular, liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies based on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations, including zero-shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves improvement up to $35\%$ in success rate compared with the best-performing baseline. More details can be found on our website https://ruiiu.github.io/imrl.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flying in Highly Dynamic Environments with End-to-end Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14352v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obstacle avoidance for unmanned aerial vehicles like quadrotors is a popular research topic. Most existing research focuses only on static environments, and obstacle avoidance in environments with multiple dynamic obstacles remains challenging. This paper proposes a novel deep-reinforcement learning-based approach for the quadrotors to navigate through highly dynamic environments. We propose a lidar data encoder to extract obstacle information from the massive point cloud data from the lidar. Multi frames of historical scans will be compressed into a 2-dimension obstacle map while maintaining the obstacle features required. An end-to-end deep neural network is trained to extract the kinematics of dynamic and static obstacles from the obstacle map, and it will generate acceleration commands to the quadrotor to control it to avoid these obstacles. Our approach contains perception and navigating functions in a single neural network, which can change from a navigating state into a hovering state without mode switching. We also present simulations and real-world experiments to show the effectiveness of our approach while navigating in highly dynamic cluttered environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Offline Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning via Inverse Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07933v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical policies enable strong performance in many sequential decision-making problems, such as those with high-dimensional action spaces, those requiring long-horizon planning, and settings with sparse rewards. However, learning hierarchical policies from static offline datasets presents a significant challenge. Crucially, actions taken by higher-level policies may not be directly observable within hierarchical controllers, and the offline dataset might have been generated using a different policy structure, hindering the use of standard offline learning algorithms. In this work, we propose OHIO: a framework for offline reinforcement learning (RL) of hierarchical policies. Our framework leverages knowledge of the policy structure to solve the \textit{inverse problem}, recovering the unobservable high-level actions that likely generated the observed data under our hierarchical policy. This approach constructs a dataset suitable for off-the-shelf offline training. We demonstrate our framework on robotic and network optimization problems and show that it substantially outperforms end-to-end RL methods and improves robustness. We investigate a variety of instantiations of our framework, both in direct deployment of policies trained offline and when online fine-tuning is performed. Code and data are available at https://ohio-offline-hierarchical-rl.github.io</p></details> |  |
| **[MANTRA: Enhancing Automated Method-Level Refactoring with Contextual RAG and Multi-Agent LLM Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14340v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining and scaling software systems relies heavily on effective code refactoring, yet this process remains labor-intensive, requiring developers to carefully analyze existing codebases and prevent the introduction of new defects. Although recent advancements have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate refactoring tasks, current solutions are constrained in scope and lack mechanisms to guarantee code compilability and successful test execution. In this work, we introduce MANTRA, a comprehensive LLM agent-based framework that automates method-level refactoring. MANTRA integrates Context-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation, coordinated Multi-Agent Collaboration, and Verbal Reinforcement Learning to emulate human decision-making during refactoring while preserving code correctness and readability. Our empirical study, conducted on 703 instances of "pure refactorings" (i.e., code changes exclusively involving structural improvements), drawn from 10 representative Java projects, covers the six most prevalent refactoring operations. Experimental results demonstrate that MANTRA substantially surpasses a baseline LLM model (RawGPT ), achieving an 82.8% success rate (582/703) in producing code that compiles and passes all tests, compared to just 8.7% (61/703) with RawGPT. Moreover, in comparison to IntelliJ's LLM-powered refactoring tool (EM-Assist), MANTRA exhibits a 50% improvement in generating Extract Method transformations. A usability study involving 37 professional developers further shows that refactorings performed by MANTRA are perceived to be as readable and reusable as human-written code, and in certain cases, even more favorable. These results highlight the practical advantages of MANTRA and emphasize the growing potential of LLM-based systems in advancing the automation of software refactoring tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Revealing higher-order neural representations with generative artificial intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14333v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studies often aim to reveal how neural representations encode aspects of an observer's environment, such as its contents or structure. These are ``first-order" representations (FORs), because they're ``about" the external world. A less-common target is ``higher-order" representations (HORs), which are ``about" FORs -- their contents, stability, or uncertainty. HORs of uncertainty appear critically involved in adaptive behaviors including learning under uncertainty, influencing learning rates and internal model updating based on environmental feedback. However, HORs about uncertainty are unlikely to be direct ``read-outs" of FOR characteristics, instead reflecting estimation processes which may be lossy, bias-prone, or distortive and which may also incorporate estimates of distributions of uncertainty the observer is likely to experience. While some research has targeted neural representations of ``instantaneously" estimated uncertainty, how the brain represents \textit{distributions} of expected uncertainty remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based generative artificial intelligence (genAI) approach to explore neural representations of uncertainty distributions. We use existing functional magnetic resonance imaging data, where humans learned to `de-noise' their brain states to achieve target neural patterns, to train denoising diffusion genAI models with RL algorithms to learn noise distributions similar to how humans might learn to do the same. We then explore these models' learned noise-distribution HORs compared to control models trained with traditional backpropagation. Results reveal model-dependent differences in noise distribution representations -- with the RL-based model offering much higher explanatory power for human behavior -- offering an exciting path towards using genAI to explore neural noise-distribution HORs.</p></details> |  |

We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an RL algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one, and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N^{\frac{3}{4}})$ up to a logarithmic factor, where $N$ is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. We also perform numerical comparisons between our method and those of the recent model-based stochastic LQ RL studies adapted to the state- and control-dependent volatility setting, demonstrating a better performance of the former in terms of regret bounds.</p></details> | 49 pages, 4 figures |

Tapered Off-Policy REINFORCE (TOPR) uses an asymmetric, tapered variant of importance sampling to speed up learning while maintaining stable learning dynamics, even without the use of KL regularization. TOPR can be applied in a fully offline fashion, allows the handling of positive and negative examples in a unified framework, and benefits from the implementational simplicity that is typical of Monte Carlo algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a series of experiments on the GSM8K and MATH reasoning benchmarks, finding performance gains for training both a model for solution generation and as a generative verifier. We show that properly leveraging positive and negative examples alike in the off-policy regime simultaneously increases test-time accuracy and training data efficiency, all the while avoiding the ``wasted inference'' that comes with discarding negative examples. We find that this advantage persists over multiple iterations of training and can be amplified by dataset curation techniques, enabling us to match 70B-parameter model performance with 8B language models. As a corollary to this work, we find that REINFORCE's baseline parameter plays an important and unexpected role in defining dataset composition in the presence of negative examples, and is consequently critical in driving off-policy performance.</p></details> |  |

An example of a task that is often laborious is the alignment of a high-finesse optical resonator, which is highly sensitive to the mode of the input beam. In this work, we demonstrate how machine learning can be used to achieve autonomous mode-matching of a free-space optical resonator with minimal supervision. Our approach leverages sample-efficient algorithms to reduce data requirements while maintaining a simple architecture for easy deployment. The reinforcement learning scheme that we have developed shows that automation is feasible even in systems prone to drift in experimental parameters, as may well be the case in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, current RL-based exploration algorithms often face limited environmental reasoning capabilities, slow convergence rates, and substantial challenges in Sim-To-Real (S2R) transfer. To address these issues, we propose a Curriculum Learning-based Transformer Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (CTSAC) aimed at improving both exploration efficiency and transfer performance. To enhance the robot's reasoning ability, a Transformer is integrated into the perception network of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework, leveraging historical information to improve the farsightedness of the strategy. A periodic review-based curriculum learning is proposed, which enhances training efficiency while mitigating catastrophic forgetting during curriculum transitions. Training is conducted on the ROS-Gazebo continuous robotic simulation platform, with LiDAR clustering optimization to further reduce the S2R gap. Experimental results demonstrate the CTSAC algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art non-learning and learning-based algorithms in terms of success rate and success rate-weighted exploration time. Moreover, real-world experiments validate the strong S2R transfer capabilities of CTSAC.</p></details> | <details><summary>7page...</summary><p>7pages,7 figures,Thesis received by 2025 ICRA</p></details> |

A common approach to achieving this is imitation learning, where agents are trained to mimic human expert demonstrations collected from real-world driving scenarios. However, discrepancies between human perception and the self-driving car's sensors can introduce an $\textit{imitation}$ gap, leading to imitation learning failures. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{IGDrivSim}$, a benchmark built on top of the Waymax simulator, designed to investigate the effects of the imitation gap in learning autonomous driving policy from human expert demonstrations. Our experiments show that this perception gap between human experts and self-driving agents can hinder the learning of safe and effective driving behaviors. We further show that combining imitation with reinforcement learning, using a simple penalty reward for prohibited behaviors, effectively mitigates these failures.

The burgeoning field of intelligent transportation systems, bolstered by artificial intelligence techniques and extensive data availability, offers new prospects for the implementation of ATSC. In this study, we introduce a parallel hybrid action space reinforcement learning model (PH-DDPG) that optimizes traffic signal phase and duration of traffic signals simultaneously, eliminating the need for sequential decision-making seen in traditional two-stage models. Our model features a task-specific parallel hybrid action space tailored for adaptive traffic control, which directly outputs discrete phase selections and their associated continuous duration parameters concurrently, thereby inherently addressing dynamic traffic adaptation through unified parametric optimization. %Our model features a unique parallel hybrid action space that allows for the simultaneous output of each action and its optimal parameters, streamlining the decision-making process. Furthermore, to ascertain the robustness and effectiveness of this approach, we executed ablation studies focusing on the utilization of a random action parameter mask within the critic network, which decouples the parameter space for individual actions, facilitating the use of preferable parameters for each action. The results from these studies confirm the efficacy of this method, distinctly enhancing real-world applicability</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, Reinforcement Learning</p></details> |

First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

We propose Offline Stabilization Phases for Efficient Q-Learning (SPEQ), an RL algorithm that combines low-UTD online training with periodic offline stabilization phases. During these phases, Q-functions are fine-tuned with high UTD ratios on a fixed replay buffer, reducing redundant updates on suboptimal data. This structured training schedule optimally balances computational and sample efficiency, addressing the limitations of both high and low UTD ratio approaches. We empirically demonstrate that SPEQ requires from 40% to 99% fewer gradient updates and 27% to 78% less training time compared to state-of-the-art high UTD ratio methods while maintaining or surpassing their performance on the MuJoCo continuous control benchmark. Our findings highlight the potential of periodic stabilization phases as an effective alternative to conventional training schedules, paving the way for more scalable reinforcement learning solutions in real-world applications where computational resources are constrained.</p></details> |  |

However, multimodal reasoning, which requires integrating visual and textual information, remains a significant challenge. Existing visual-language models often struggle to effectively analyze and reason visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on complex reasoning tasks. Moreover, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks hinders the accurate assessment of multimodal reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce R1-Onevision, a multimodal reasoning model designed to bridge the gap between visual perception and deep reasoning. To achieve this, we propose a cross-modal reasoning pipeline that transforms images into formal textural representations, enabling precise language-based reasoning. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct the R1-Onevision dataset which provides detailed, step-by-step multimodal reasoning annotations across diverse domains. We further develop the R1-Onevision model through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to cultivate advanced reasoning and robust generalization abilities. To comprehensively evaluate multimodal reasoning performance across different grades, we introduce R1-Onevision-Bench, a benchmark aligned with human educational stages, covering exams from junior high school to university and beyond. Experimental results show that R1-Onevision achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming models such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL on multiple challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and Model: https://github.com/Fancy-MLLM/R1-onevision</p></details> |

While they achieve remarkable performance on challenging tasks such as mathematics and coding, they often rely on their internal knowledge to solve problems, which can be inadequate for time-sensitive or knowledge-intensive questions, leading to inaccuracies and hallucinations. To address this, we propose \textbf{R1-Searcher}, a novel two-stage outcome-based RL approach designed to enhance the search capabilities of LLMs. This method allows LLMs to autonomously invoke external search systems to access additional knowledge during the reasoning process. Our framework relies exclusively on RL, without requiring process rewards or distillation for a cold start. % effectively generalizing to out-of-domain datasets and supporting both Base and Instruct models.

This paper introduces a novel Real-Sim-Real (RSR) loop framework leveraging differentiable simulation to address this gap by iteratively refining simulation parameters, aligning them with real-world conditions, and enabling robust and efficient policy transfer. A key contribution of our work is the design of an informative cost function that encourages the collection of diverse and representative real-world data, minimizing bias and maximizing the utility of each data point for simulation refinement. This cost function integrates seamlessly into existing reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC) and ensures a balanced exploration of critical regions in the real domain. Furthermore, our approach is implemented on the versatile Mujoco MJX platform, and our framework is compatible with a wide range of robotic systems. Experimental results on several robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the sim-to-real gap, achieving high task performance and generalizability across diverse scenarios of both explicit and implicit environmental uncertainties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing and Bridging the Gap between Maximizing Total Reward and Discounted Reward in Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13279v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The optimal objective is a fundamental aspect of reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines how policies are evaluated and optimized. While total return maximization is the ideal objective in RL, discounted return maximization is the practical objective due to its stability. This can lead to a misalignment of objectives. To better understand the problem, we theoretically analyze the performance gap between the policy maximizes the total return and the policy maximizes the discounted return. Our analysis reveals that increasing the discount factor can be ineffective at eliminating this gap when environment contains cyclic states,a frequent scenario. To address this issue, we propose two alternative approaches to align the objectives. The first approach achieves alignment by modifying the terminal state value, treating it as a tunable hyper-parameter with its suitable range defined through theoretical analysis. The second approach focuses on calibrating the reward data in trajectories, enabling alignment in practical Deep RL applications using off-policy algorithms. This method enhances robustness to the discount factor and improve performance when the trajectory length is large. Our proposed methods demonstrate that adjusting reward data can achieve alignment, providing an insight that can be leveraged to design new optimization objectives to fundamentally enhance the performance of RL algorithms.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional deep learning and Transformer models often struggle to process data with inherent symmetries and invariances, typically relying on large datasets or extensive data augmentation. Equivariant neural networks overcome these limitations by explicitly integrating symmetry and invariance into their architectures, leading to improved efficiency and generalization. This tutorial survey reviews a wide range of equivariant deep learning and control methods for robotics, from classic to state-of-the-art, with a focus on SE(3)-equivariant models that leverage the natural 3D rotational and translational symmetries in visual robotic manipulation and control design. Using unified mathematical notation, we begin by reviewing key concepts from group theory, along with matrix Lie groups and Lie algebras. We then introduce foundational group-equivariant neural network design and show how the group-equivariance can be obtained through their structure. Next, we discuss the applications of SE(3)-equivariant neural networks in robotics in terms of imitation learning and reinforcement learning. The SE(3)-equivariant control design is also reviewed from the perspective of geometric control. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions of equivariant methods in developing more robust, sample-efficient, and multi-modal real-world robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to International Journcal of Control, Automation and Systems (IJCAS), Under Review</p></details> |

Medical reasoning tasks demand robust image analysis and well-justified answers, posing challenges due to the complexity of medical images. Transparency and trustworthiness are essential for clinical adoption and regulatory compliance. We introduce Med-R1, a framework exploring reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance VLMs' generalizability and trustworthiness in medical reasoning. Leveraging the DeepSeek strategy, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to guide reasoning paths via reward signals. Unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often overfits and lacks generalization, RL fosters robust and diverse reasoning. Med-R1 is evaluated across eight medical imaging modalities: CT, MRI, Ultrasound, Dermoscopy, Fundus Photography, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Microscopy, and X-ray Imaging. Compared to its base model, Qwen2-VL-2B, Med-R1 achieves a 29.94% accuracy improvement and outperforms Qwen2-VL-72B, which has 36 times more parameters. Testing across five question types-modality recognition, anatomy identification, disease diagnosis, lesion grading, and biological attribute analysis Med-R1 demonstrates superior generalization, exceeding Qwen2-VL-2B by 32.06% and surpassing Qwen2-VL-72B in question-type generalization. These findings show that RL improves medical reasoning and enables parameter-efficient models to outperform significantly larger ones. With interpretable reasoning outputs, Med-R1 represents a promising step toward generalizable, trustworthy, and clinically viable medical VLMs.</p></details> |  |

Recently, deep reinforcement learning-based methods have been actively studied and have outperformed traditional rule-based approaches owing to their optimization capabilities. Among these, methods that assume a continuous action space typically rely on a Gaussian distribution assumption, which limits the flexibility of generated actions. Meanwhile, the application of diffusion models to reinforcement learning has advanced, allowing for more flexible action distributions compared with Gaussian distribution-based approaches. In this study, we applied a diffusion-based reinforcement learning approach to social navigation and validated its effectiveness. Furthermore, by leveraging the characteristics of diffusion models, we propose an extension that enables post-training action smoothing and adaptation to static obstacle scenarios not considered during the training steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IROS 2025 for possible publication</p></details> |

Despite possessing vast expert-level knowledge, MLLMs struggle to integrate reasoning into visual perception, often generating direct responses without deeper analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce knowledge-intensive visual grounding (KVG), a novel visual grounding task that requires both fine-grained perception and domain-specific knowledge integration. To address the challenges of KVG, we propose DeepPerception, an MLLM enhanced with cognitive visual perception capabilities. Our approach consists of (1) an automated data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality, knowledge-aligned training samples, and (2) a two-stage training framework combining supervised fine-tuning for cognitive reasoning scaffolding and reinforcement learning to optimize perception-cognition synergy. To benchmark performance, we introduce KVG-Bench a comprehensive dataset spanning 10 domains with 1.3K manually curated test cases. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepPerception significantly outperforms direct fine-tuning, achieving +8.08\% accuracy improvements on KVG-Bench and exhibiting +4.60\% superior cross-domain generalization over baseline approaches. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating cognitive processes into MLLMs for human-like visual perception and open new directions for multimodal reasoning research.

However, their potential in the decision-making domain, particularly in model-based reinforcement learning, remains underexplored. The difficulty lies in the need for spiking neurons with long-term temporal memory capabilities, as well as network optimization that can integrate and learn information for accurate predictions. The dynamic dendritic information integration mechanism of biological neurons brings us valuable insights for addressing these challenges. In this study, we propose a multi-compartment neuron model capable of nonlinearly integrating information from multiple dendritic sources to dynamically process long sequential inputs. Based on this model, we construct a Spiking World Model (Spiking-WM), to enable model-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with SNNs. We evaluated our model using the DeepMind Control Suite, demonstrating that Spiking-WM outperforms existing SNN-based models and achieves performance comparable to artificial neural network (ANN)-based world models employing Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Furthermore, we assess the long-term memory capabilities of the proposed model in speech datasets, including SHD, TIMIT, and LibriSpeech 100h, showing that our multi-compartment neuron model surpasses other SNN-based architectures in processing long sequences. Our findings underscore the critical role of dendritic information integration in shaping neuronal function, emphasizing the importance of cooperative dendritic processing in enhancing neural computation.</p></details> |  |

While model-based reinforcement learning enhances the agent's reasoning and planning capabilities by constructing virtual environments, training such virtual environments can be very complex. In order to build an efficient inference model and enhance the representativeness of learning data, we propose the Counterfactual Experience Augmentation (CEA) algorithm. CEA leverages variational autoencoders to model the dynamic patterns of state transitions and introduces randomness to model non-stationarity. This approach focuses on expanding the learning data in the experience pool through counterfactual inference and performs exceptionally well in environments that follow the bisimulation assumption. Environments with bisimulation properties are usually represented by discrete observation and action spaces, we propose a sampling method based on maximum kernel density estimation entropy to extend CEA to various environments. By providing reward signals for counterfactual state transitions based on real information, CEA constructs a complete counterfactual experience to alleviate the out-of-distribution problem of the learning data, and outperforms general SOTA algorithms in environments with difference properties. Finally, we discuss the similarities, differences and properties of generated counterfactual experiences and real experiences.

For instance, a trained dog can track and catch a flying frisbee before it touches the ground, while a cat left alone at home may leap to grasp the door handle. Successfully grasping an object during high-dynamic locomotion requires highly precise perception and control. However, due to hardware limitations, agility and precision are usually a trade-off in robotics problems. In this work, we employ a perception-control decoupled system based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), aiming to explore the level of precision a quadrupedal robot can achieve while interacting with objects during high-dynamic locomotion. Our experiments show that our quadrupedal robot, mounted with a passive gripper in front of the robot's chassis, can perform both tracking and catching tasks similar to a real trained dog. The robot can follow a mid-air ball moving at speeds of up to 3m/s and it can leap and successfully catch a small object hanging above it at a height of 1.05m in simulation and 0.8m in the real world.</p></details> |  |

Preference-based RL mitigates some of these pitfalls by learning rewards from comparative feedback rather than hand-crafted signals, yet scaling human annotations remains challenging. Recent work uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automate preference labeling, but a single final-state image generally fails to capture the agent's full motion. In this paper, we present a two-part solution that both improves feedback accuracy and better aligns reward learning with the agent's policy. First, we overlay trajectory sketches on final observations to reveal the path taken, allowing VLMs to provide more reliable preferences-improving preference accuracy by approximately 15-20% in metaworld tasks. Second, we regularize reward learning by incorporating the agent's performance, ensuring that the reward model is optimized based on data generated by the current policy; this addition boosts episode returns by 20-30% in locomotion tasks. Empirical studies on metaworld demonstrate that our method achieves, for instance, around 70-80% success rate in all tasks, compared to below 50% for standard approaches. These results underscore the efficacy of combining richer visual representations with agent-aware reward regularization.</p></details> | 8 pages |

This paper addresses the estimation of the Bayesian posterior to generate diverse samples by approximating the gradient flow of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and the cross entropy of the target approximation under the metric induced by the Stein Operator.

Manual or random hyperparameter tuning methods can lead to different results in the reinforcement learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new method called QF-tuner for automatic hyperparameter tuning in the Q learning algorithm using the FOX optimization algorithm (FOX). Furthermore, a new objective function has been employed within FOX that prioritizes reward over learning error and time. QF tuner starts by running the FOX and tries to minimize the fitness value derived from observations at each iteration by executing the Q-learning algorithm. The proposed method has been evaluated using two control tasks from the OpenAI Gym: CartPole and FrozenLake. The empirical results indicate that the QF-tuner outperforms other optimization algorithms, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), bees algorithm (BA), genetic algorithms (GA), and the random method. However, on the FrozenLake task, the QF-tuner increased rewards by 36% and reduced learning time by 26%, while on the CartPole task, it increased rewards by 57% and reduced learning time by 20%. Thus, the QF-tuner is an essential method for hyperparameter tuning in Q-learning algorithms, enabling more effective solutions to control task problems.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers adaptive solutions, but online MARL requires extensive interactions with the environment, making it costly and impractical. Offline MARL mitigates these challenges by using historical traffic data for training but faces significant difficulties with heterogeneous behavior policies in real-world datasets, where mixed-quality data complicates learning. We introduce OffLight, a novel offline MARL framework designed to handle heterogeneous behavior policies in TSC datasets. To improve learning efficiency, OffLight incorporates Importance Sampling (IS) to correct for distributional shifts and Return-Based Prioritized Sampling (RBPS) to focus on high-quality experiences. OffLight utilizes a Gaussian Mixture Variational Graph Autoencoder (GMM-VGAE) to capture the diverse distribution of behavior policies from local observations. Extensive experiments across real-world urban traffic scenarios show that OffLight outperforms existing offline RL methods, achieving up to a 7.8% reduction in average travel time and 11.2% decrease in queue length. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of OffLight's components in handling heterogeneous data and improving policy performance. These results highlight OffLight's scalability and potential to improve urban traffic management without the risks of online learning.</p></details> |  |

However, a key bottleneck in many domains is that RL methods cannot accommodate large, combinatorially structured action spaces. In such settings, even representing the set of feasible actions at a single step may require a complex discrete optimization formulation. We leverage recent advances in embedding trained neural networks into optimization problems to propose SEQUOIA, an RL algorithm that directly optimizes for long-term reward over the feasible action space. Our approach embeds a Q-network into a mixed-integer program to select a combinatorial action in each timestep. Here, we focus on planning over restless bandits, a class of planning problems which capture many real-world examples of sequential decision making. We introduce coRMAB, a broader class of restless bandits with combinatorial actions that cannot be decoupled across the arms of the restless bandit, requiring direct solving over the joint, exponentially large action space. We empirically validate SEQUOIA on four novel restless bandit problems with combinatorial constraints: multiple interventions, path constraints, bipartite matching, and capacity constraints. Our approach significantly outperforms existing methods -- which cannot address sequential planning and combinatorial selection simultaneously -- by an average of 24.8\% on these difficult instances.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ICLR 2025.

In this work, we introduce Sable, a performant, memory efficient and scalable sequence modeling approach to MARL. Sable works by adapting the retention mechanism in Retentive Networks (Sun et al., 2023) to achieve computationally efficient processing of multi-agent observations with long context memory for temporal reasoning. Through extensive evaluations across six diverse environments, we demonstrate how Sable is able to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in a large number of diverse tasks (34 out of 45 tested). Furthermore, Sable maintains performance as we scale the number of agents, handling environments with more than a thousand agents while exhibiting a linear increase in memory usage. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to isolate the source of Sable's performance gains and confirm its efficient computational memory usage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncovering Utility Functions from Observed Outcomes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13432v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining consumer preferences and utility is a foundational challenge in economics. They are central in determining consumer behaviour through the utility-maximising consumer decision-making process. However, preferences and utilities are not observable and may not even be known to the individual making the choice; only the outcome is observed in the form of demand. Without the ability to observe the decision-making mechanism, demand estimation becomes a challenging task and current methods fall short due to lack of scalability or ability to identify causal effects. Estimating these effects is critical when considering changes in policy, such as pricing, the impact of taxes and subsidies, and the effect of a tariff. To address the shortcomings of existing methods, we combine revealed preference theory and inverse reinforcement learning to present a novel algorithm, Preference Extraction and Reward Learning (PEARL) which, to the best of our knowledge, is the only algorithm that can uncover a representation of the utility function that best rationalises observed consumer choice data given a specified functional form. We introduce a flexible utility function, the Input-Concave Neural Network which captures complex relationships across goods, including cross-price elasticities. Results show PEARL outperforms the benchmark on both noise-free and noisy synthetic data.</p></details> | Working paper |

Traditional methods, such as robot-centric reinforcement learning (RL), imitation learning, and hybrid techniques, require massive training and often struggle to generalize across different objects and robot platforms. We propose a novel framework for learning object-centric manipulation policies in force space, decoupling the robot from the object. By directly applying forces to selected regions of the object, our method simplifies the action space, reduces unnecessary exploration, and decreases simulation overhead. This approach, trained in simulation on a small set of representative objects, captures object dynamics -- such as joint configurations -- allowing policies to generalize effectively to new, unseen objects. Decoupling these policies from robot-specific dynamics enables direct transfer to different robotic platforms (e.g., Kinova, Panda, UR5) without retraining. Our evaluations demonstrate that the method significantly outperforms baselines, achieving over an order of magnitude improvement in training efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, operating in force space enhances policy transferability across diverse robot platforms and object types.

| **[A Comprehensive Survey on Multi-Agent Cooperative Decision-Making: Scenarios, Approaches, Challenges and Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13415v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, intelligent decision-making techniques have gradually surpassed human levels in various human-machine competitions, especially in complex multi-agent cooperative task scenarios. Multi-agent cooperative decision-making involves multiple agents working together to complete established tasks and achieve specific objectives. These techniques are widely applicable in real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving, drone navigation, disaster rescue, and simulated military confrontations. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of the leading simulation environments and platforms used for multi-agent cooperative decision-making. Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis for these simulation environments from various perspectives, including task formats, reward allocation, and the underlying technologies employed. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive overview of the mainstream intelligent decision-making approaches, algorithms and models for multi-agent systems (MAS). Theseapproaches can be broadly categorized into five types: rule-based (primarily fuzzy logic), game theory-based, evolutionary algorithms-based, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based, and large language models(LLMs)reasoning-based. Given the significant advantages of MARL andLLMs-baseddecision-making methods over the traditional rule, game theory, and evolutionary algorithms, this paper focuses on these multi-agent methods utilizing MARL and LLMs-based techniques. We provide an in-depth discussion of these approaches, highlighting their methodology taxonomies, advantages, and drawbacks. Further, several prominent research directions in the future and potential challenges of multi-agent cooperative decision-making are also detailed.</p></details> | 54 pages, 24 figures |

| **[Fine-Tuning Discrete Diffusion Models via Reward Optimization with Applications to DNA and Protein Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13643v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the strong empirical performance of diffusion models on discrete sequences across domains from natural language to biological sequence generation. For example, in the protein inverse folding task, conditional diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generating natural-like sequences that fold back into the original structure. However, practical design tasks often require not only modeling a conditional distribution but also optimizing specific task objectives. For instance, we may prefer protein sequences with high stability. To address this, we consider the scenario where we have pre-trained discrete diffusion models that can generate natural-like sequences, as well as reward models that map sequences to task objectives. We then formulate the reward maximization problem within discrete diffusion models, analogous to reinforcement learning (RL), while minimizing the KL divergence against pretrained diffusion models to preserve naturalness. To solve this RL problem, we propose a novel algorithm, DRAKES, that enables direct backpropagation of rewards through entire trajectories generated by diffusion models, by making the originally non-differentiable trajectories differentiable using the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our theoretical analysis indicates that our approach can generate sequences that are both natural-like and yield high rewards. While similar tasks have been recently explored in diffusion models for continuous domains, our work addresses unique algorithmic and theoretical challenges specific to discrete diffusion models, which arise from their foundation in continuous-time Markov chains rather than Brownian motion. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DRAKES in generating DNA and protein sequences that optimize enhancer activity and protein stability, respectively, important tasks for gene therapies and protein-based therapeutics.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Agents Play Thousands of 3D Video Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13356v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present PORTAL, a novel framework for developing artificial intelligence agents capable of playing thousands of 3D video games through language-guided policy generation. By transforming decision-making problems into language modeling tasks, our approach leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate behavior trees represented in domain-specific language (DSL). This method eliminates the computational burden associated with traditional reinforcement learning approaches while preserving strategic depth and rapid adaptability. Our framework introduces a hybrid policy structure that combines rule-based nodes with neural network components, enabling both high-level strategic reasoning and precise low-level control. A dual-feedback mechanism incorporating quantitative game metrics and vision-language model analysis facilitates iterative policy improvement at both tactical and strategic levels. The resulting policies are instantaneously deployable, human-interpretable, and capable of generalizing across diverse gaming environments. Experimental results demonstrate PORTAL's effectiveness across thousands of first-person shooter (FPS) games, showcasing significant improvements in development efficiency, policy generalization, and behavior diversity compared to traditional approaches. PORTAL represents a significant advancement in game AI development, offering a practical solution for creating sophisticated agents that can operate across thousands of commercial video games with minimal development overhead.

| **[Local-Global Learning of Interpretable Control Policies: The Interface between MPC and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13289v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Making optimal decisions under uncertainty is a shared problem among distinct fields. While optimal control is commonly studied in the framework of dynamic programming, it is approached with differing perspectives of the Bellman optimality condition. In one perspective, the Bellman equation is used to derive a global optimality condition useful for iterative learning of control policies through interactions with an environment. Alternatively, the Bellman equation is also widely adopted to derive tractable optimization-based control policies that satisfy a local notion of optimality. By leveraging ideas from the two perspectives, we present a local-global paradigm for optimal control suited for learning interpretable local decision makers that approximately satisfy the global Bellman equation. The benefits and practical complications in local-global learning are discussed. These aspects are exemplified through case studies, which give an overview of two distinct strategies for unifying reinforcement learning and model predictive control. We discuss the challenges and trade-offs in these local-global strategies, towards highlighting future research opportunities for safe and optimal decision-making under uncertainty.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint for ACC 2025 tutorial</p></details> |
| **[Environment as Policy: Learning to Race in Unseen Tracks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22308v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved outstanding success in complex robot control tasks, such as drone racing, where the RL agents have outperformed human champions in a known racing track. However, these agents fail in unseen track configurations, always requiring complete retraining when presented with new track layouts. This work aims to develop RL agents that generalize effectively to novel track configurations without retraining. The naive solution of training directly on a diverse set of track layouts can overburden the agent, resulting in suboptimal policy learning as the increased complexity of the environment impairs the agent's ability to learn to fly. To enhance the generalizability of the RL agent, we propose an adaptive environment-shaping framework that dynamically adjusts the training environment based on the agent's performance. We achieve this by leveraging a secondary RL policy to design environments that strike a balance between being challenging and achievable, allowing the agent to adapt and improve progressively. Using our adaptive environment shaping, one single racing policy efficiently learns to race in diverse challenging tracks. Experimental results validated in both simulation and the real world show that our method enables drones to successfully fly complex and unseen race tracks, outperforming existing environment-shaping techniques.

| **[Timing the Match: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Ride-Hailing and Ride-Pooling Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13200v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient timing in ride-matching is crucial for improving the performance of ride-hailing and ride-pooling services, as it determines the number of drivers and passengers considered in each matching process. Traditional batched matching methods often use fixed time intervals to accumulate ride requests before assigning matches. While this approach increases the number of available drivers and passengers for matching, it fails to adapt to real-time supply-demand fluctuations, often leading to longer passenger wait times and driver idle periods. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive ride-matching strategy using deep reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically determine when to perform matches based on real-time system conditions. Unlike fixed-interval approaches, our method continuously evaluates system states and executes matching at moments that minimize total passenger wait time. Additionally, we incorporate a potential-based reward shaping (PBRS) mechanism to mitigate sparse rewards, accelerating RL training and improving decision quality. Extensive empirical evaluations using a realistic simulator trained on real-world data demonstrate that our approach outperforms fixed-interval matching strategies, significantly reducing passenger waiting times and detour delays, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of ride-hailing and ride-pooling systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Life-inspired Interoceptive Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous and Adaptive Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05999v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building autonomous -- i.e., choosing goals based on one's needs -- and adaptive -- i.e., surviving in ever-changing environments -- agents has been a holy grail of artificial intelligence (AI). A living organism is a prime example of such an agent, offering important lessons about adaptive autonomy. Here, we focus on interoception, a process of monitoring one's internal environment to keep it within certain bounds, which underwrites the survival of an organism. To develop AI with interoception, we need to factorize the state variables representing internal environments from external environments and adopt life-inspired mathematical properties of internal environment states. This paper offers a new perspective on how interoception can help build autonomous and adaptive agents by integrating the legacy of cybernetics with recent advances in theories of life, reinforcement learning, and neuroscience.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 3 figures, 2 boxes</p></details> |
| **[A representational framework for learning and encoding structurally enriched trajectories in complex agent environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13194v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of artificial intelligence agents to make optimal decisions and generalise them to different domains and tasks is compromised in complex scenarios. One way to address this issue has focused on learning efficient representations of the world and on how the actions of agents affect them, such as disentangled representations that exploit symmetries. Whereas such representations are procedurally efficient, they are based on the compression of low-level state-action transitions, which lack structural richness. To address this problem, we propose to enrich the agent's ontology and extend the traditional conceptualisation of trajectories to provide a more nuanced view of task execution. Structurally Enriched Trajectories (SETs) extend the encoding of sequences of states and their transitions by incorporating hierarchical relations between objects, interactions and affordances. SETs are built as multi-level graphs, providing a detailed representation of the agent dynamics and a transferable functional abstraction of the task. SETs are integrated into an architecture, Structurally Enriched Trajectory Learning and Encoding (SETLE), that employs a heterogeneous graph-based memory structure of multi-level relational dependencies essential for generalisation. Using reinforcement learning as a data generation tool, we demonstrate that SETLE can support downstream tasks, enabling agents to recognise task-relevant structural patterns across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Better Sample Efficiency in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13077v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning has shown promise in learning cooperative behaviors in team-based environments. However, such methods often demand extensive training time. For instance, the state-of-the-art method TiZero takes 40 days to train high-quality policies for a football environment. In this paper, we hypothesize that better exploration mechanisms can improve the sample efficiency of multi-agent methods. We propose two different approaches for better exploration in TiZero: a self-supervised intrinsic reward and a random network distillation bonus. Additionally, we introduce architectural modifications to the original algorithm to enhance TiZero's computational efficiency. We evaluate the sample efficiency of these approaches through extensive experiments. Our results show that random network distillation improves training sample efficiency by 18.8% compared to the original TiZero. Furthermore, we evaluate the qualitative behavior of the models produced by both variants against a heuristic AI, with the self-supervised reward encouraging possession and random network distillation leading to a more offensive performance. Our results highlights the applicability of our random network distillation variant in practical settings. Lastly, due to the nature of the proposed method, we acknowledge its use beyond football simulation, especially in environments with strong multi-agent and strategic aspects.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[On the Convergence of Monte Carlo UCB for Random-Length Episodic MDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02864v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reinforcement learning, Monte Carlo algorithms update the Q function by averaging the episodic returns. In the Monte Carlo UCB (MC-UCB) algorithm, the action taken in each state is the action that maximizes the Q function plus an Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) exploration term, which biases the choice of actions to those that have been chosen less frequently. Although there has been significant work on establishing regret bounds for MC-UCB, most of that work has been focused on finite-horizon versions of the problem, for which each episode terminates after a constant number of steps. For such finite-horizon problems, the optimal policy depends both on the current state and the time within the episode. However, for many natural episodic problems, such as games like Go and Chess and robotic tasks, the episode is of random length and the optimal policy is stationary. For such environments, it is an open question whether the Q-function in MC-UCB will converge to the optimal Q function; we conjecture that, unlike Q-learning, it does not converge for all MDPs. We nevertheless show that for a large class of MDPs, which includes stochastic MDPs such as blackjack and deterministic MDPs such as Go, the Q function in MC-UCB converges almost surely to the optimal Q function. An immediate corollary of this result is that it also converges almost surely for all finite-horizon MDPs. We also provide numerical experiments, providing further insights into MC-UCB.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, preliminary work</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Shielding for Safe Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07671v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-life scenarios, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent aiming to maximise their reward, must often also behave in a safe manner, including at training time. Thus, much attention in recent years has been given to Safe RL, where an agent aims to learn an optimal policy among all policies that satisfy a given safety constraint. However, strict safety guarantees are often provided through approaches based on linear programming, and thus have limited scaling. In this paper we present a new, scalable method, which enjoys strict formal guarantees for Safe RL, in the case where the safety dynamics of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) are known, and safety is defined as an undiscounted probabilistic avoidance property. Our approach is based on state-augmentation of the MDP, and on the design of a shield that restricts the actions available to the agent. We show that our approach provides a strict formal safety guarantee that the agent stays safe at training and test time. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach is viable in practice through experimental evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, Conference: AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Its impact spans across various domains, including speech recognition, healthcare, autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, predictive analytics, and more. However, the complexity and dynamic nature of real-world problems present challenges in designing effective deep learning models. Consequently, several deep learning models have been developed to address different problems and applications. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey of various deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Transformer, Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN), Generative Models, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and Deep Transfer Learning. We examine the structure, applications, benefits, and limitations of each model. Furthermore, we perform an analysis using three publicly available datasets: IMDB, ARAS, and Fruit-360. We compared the performance of six renowned deep learning models: CNN, RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bidirectional GRU alongside two newer models, TCN and Transformer, using the IMDB and ARAS datasets. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of eight CNN-based models, including VGG (Visual Geometry Group), Inception, ResNet (Residual Network), InceptionResNet, Xception (Extreme Inception), MobileNet, DenseNet (Dense Convolutional Network), and NASNet (Neural Architecture Search Network), for image classification tasks using the Fruit-360 dataset.</p></details> | 62 pages, 37 figures |

Despite significant interest from operations research and machine learning communities over the years, a comprehensive platform for testing and comparing solution methods has been notably lacking. To fill this gap, we introduce a unified implementation of job shop scheduling problems and their solution methods, addressing the long-standing need for a standardized benchmarking platform in this domain. Our platform supports classic Job Shop (JSP), Flow Shop (FSP), Flexible Job Shop (FJSP), and Assembly Job Shop (AJSP), as well as variants featuring Sequence-Dependent Setup Times (SDST), variants with online arrivals of jobs, and combinations of these problems (e.g., FJSP-SDST and FAJSP). The platfrom provides a wide range of scheduling solution methods, from heuristics, metaheuristics, and exact optimization to deep reinforcement learning. The implementation is available as an open-source GitHub repository, serving as a collaborative hub for researchers, practitioners, and those new to the field. Beyond enabling direct comparisons with existing methods on widely studied benchmark problems, this resource serves as a robust starting point for addressing constrained and complex problem variants. By establishing a comprehensive and unified foundation, this platform is designed to consolidate existing knowledge and to inspire the development of next-generation algorithms in job shop scheduling research.</p></details> |  |

Empowering LLMs with advanced prompting strategies such as reasoning and acting (ReAct) (Yao et al., 2022) has shown promise in solving complex tasks traditionally requiring reinforcement learning. In this work, we apply the ReAct strategy to guide LLMs performing task-oriented dialogue (TOD). We evaluate ReAct-based LLMs (ReAct-LLMs) both in simulation and with real users. While ReAct-LLMs severely underperform state-of-the-art approaches on success rate in simulation, this difference becomes less pronounced in human evaluation. Moreover, compared to the baseline, humans report higher subjective satisfaction with ReAct-LLM despite its lower success rate, most likely thanks to its natural and confidently phrased responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robot Policy Transfer with Online Demonstrations: An Active Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12993v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer Learning (TL) is a powerful tool that enables robots to transfer learned policies across different environments, tasks, or embodiments. To further facilitate this process, efforts have been made to combine it with Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) for more flexible and efficient policy transfer. However, these approaches are almost exclusively limited to offline demonstrations collected before policy transfer starts, which may suffer from the intrinsic issue of covariance shift brought by LfD and harm the performance of policy transfer. Meanwhile, extensive work in the learning-from-scratch setting has shown that online demonstrations can effectively alleviate covariance shift and lead to better policy performance with improved sample efficiency. This work combines these insights to introduce online demonstrations into a policy transfer setting. We present Policy Transfer with Online Demonstrations, an active LfD algorithm for policy transfer that can optimize the timing and content of queries for online episodic expert demonstrations under a limited demonstration budget. We evaluate our method in eight robotic scenarios, involving policy transfer across diverse environment characteristics, task objectives, and robotic embodiments, with the aim to transfer a trained policy from a source task to a related but different target task. The results show that our method significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of average success rate and sample efficiency, compared to two canonical LfD methods with offline demonstrations and one active LfD method with online demonstrations. Additionally, we conduct preliminary sim-to-real tests of the transferred policy on three transfer scenarios in the real-world environment, demonstrating the policy effectiveness on a real robot manipulator.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we aim to enhance the MLLMs' reasoning ability beyond passively imitating positive reasoning paths. To this end, we design Step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (StepGRPO), a new online reinforcement learning framework that enables MLLMs to self-improve reasoning ability via simple, effective and dense step-wise rewarding. Specifically, StepGRPO introduces two novel rule-based reasoning rewards: Step-wise Reasoning Accuracy Reward (StepRAR) and Step-wise Reasoning Validity Reward (StepRVR). StepRAR rewards the reasoning paths that contain necessary intermediate reasoning steps via a soft key-step matching technique, while StepRAR rewards reasoning paths that follow a well-structured and logically consistent reasoning process through a reasoning completeness and logic evaluation strategy. With the proposed StepGRPO, we introduce R1-VL, a series of MLLMs with outstanding capabilities in step-by-step reasoning. Extensive experiments over 8 benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Action-Constrained Reinforcement Learning via Acceptance-Rejection Method and Augmented MDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12932v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action-constrained reinforcement learning (ACRL) is a generic framework for learning control policies with zero action constraint violation, which is required by various safety-critical and resource-constrained applications. The existing ACRL methods can typically achieve favorable constraint satisfaction but at the cost of either high computational burden incurred by the quadratic programs (QP) or increased architectural complexity due to the use of sophisticated generative models. In this paper, we propose a generic and computationally efficient framework that can adapt a standard unconstrained RL method to ACRL through two modifications: (i) To enforce the action constraints, we leverage the classic acceptance-rejection method, where we treat the unconstrained policy as the proposal distribution and derive a modified policy with feasible actions. (ii) To improve the acceptance rate of the proposal distribution, we construct an augmented two-objective Markov decision process (MDP), which include additional self-loop state transitions and a penalty signal for the rejected actions. This augmented MDP incentives the learned policy to stay close to the feasible action sets. Through extensive experiments in both robot control and resource allocation domains, we demonstrate that the proposed framework enjoys faster training progress, better constraint satisfaction, and a lower action inference time simultaneously than the state-of-the-art ACRL methods. We have made the source code publicly available to encourage further research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 14 figures.

| **[Lifelong Reinforcement Learning with Similarity-Driven Weighting by Large Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12923v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lifelong Reinforcement Learning (LRL) holds significant potential for addressing sequential tasks, but it still faces considerable challenges. A key difficulty lies in effectively preventing catastrophic forgetting and facilitating knowledge transfer while maintaining reliable decision-making performance across subsequent tasks in dynamic environments. To tackle this, we propose a novel framework, SDW (Similarity-Driven Weighting Framework), which leverages large-language-model-generated dynamic functions to precisely control the training process. The core of SDW lies in two functions pre-generated by large models: the task similarity function and the weight computation function. The task similarity function extracts multidimensional features from task descriptions to quantify the similarities and differences between tasks in terms of states, actions, and rewards. The weight computation function dynamically generates critical training parameters based on the similarity information, including the proportion of old task data stored in the Replay Buffer and the strategy consistency weight in the loss function, enabling an adaptive balance between learning new tasks and transferring knowledge from previous tasks. By generating function code offline prior to training, rather than relying on large-model inference during the training process, the SDW framework reduces computational overhead while maintaining efficiency in sequential task scenarios. Experimental results on Atari and MiniHack sequential tasks demonstrate that SDW significantly outperforms existing lifelong reinforcement learning methods.</p></details> |  |

However, there are few explorations for these foundation models used in quadruped robot navigation through terrains in 3D environments. In this work, we introduce SARO (Space Aware Robot System for Terrain Crossing), an innovative system composed of a high-level reasoning module, a closed-loop sub-task execution module, and a low-level control policy. It enables the robot to navigate across 3D terrains and reach the goal position. For high-level reasoning and execution, we propose a novel algorithmic system taking advantage of a VLM, with a design of task decomposition and a closed-loop sub-task execution mechanism. For low-level locomotion control, we utilize the Probability Annealing Selection (PAS) method to effectively train a control policy by reinforcement learning. Numerous experiments show that our whole system can accurately and robustly navigate across several 3D terrains, and its generalization ability ensures the applications in diverse indoor and outdoor scenarios and terrains.

Online reinforcement learning is often adopted to train the RL models so the models can directly adapt to real network environments. However, its trail-and-error manner can also cause catastrophic degradation of the quality of experience (QoE) of RTC application at run time. Thus, safeguard strategies such as falling back to hand-crafted heuristics can be used to run along with RL models to guarantee the actions explored in the training sensible, despite that these safeguard strategies interrupt the learning process and make it more challenging to discover optimal RL policies. The recent emergence of loss-tolerant neural video codecs (NVC) naturally provides a layer of protection for the online learning of RL-based congestion control because of its resilience to packet losses, but such packet loss resilience have not been fully exploited in prior works yet. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) based congestion control which can be aware of and takes advantage of packet loss tolerance characteristic of NVCs via reward in online RL learning. Through extensive evaluation on various videos and network traces in a simulated environment, we demonstrate that our NVC-aware CC running with the loss-tolerant NVC reduces the training time by 41\% compared to other prior RL-based CCs. It also boosts the mean video quality by 0.3 to 1.6dB, lower the tail frame delay by 3 to 200ms, and reduces the video stalls by 20\% to 77\% in comparison with other baseline RTC CCs.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, a joint antenna positioning and transmit power optimization problem is formulated to maximize the total communication data rate while meeting the target sensing requirements and the system energy constraint. To address the complex non-convex optimization problem, we propose a maximum entropy-based reinforcement learning (MERL) solution. By maximizing cumulative reward and policy entropy, this approach effectively balances exploration and exploitation to enhance robustness. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MERL algorithm surpasses other benchmark schemes in cumulative reward, total data rate, sensing signal-to-noise ratio, and stability.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

However, the substantial computational costs associated with RL-based approaches have led to growing interest in alternative paradigms, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of DPO in facilitating self-improvement for LLMs through iterative preference-based learning. We demonstrate that a single round of DPO with coarse filtering significantly enhances mathematical reasoning performance, particularly for strong base model. Furthermore, we design an iterative enhancement framework for both the generator and the reward model (RM), enabling their mutual improvement through online interaction across multiple rounds of DPO. Finally, with simple verifiable rewards, our model DPO-VP achieves RL-level performance with significantly lower computational overhead. These findings highlight DPO as a scalable and cost-effective alternative to RL, offering a practical solution for enhancing LLM reasoning in resource-constrained situations.</p></details> |  |
| **[ACL-QL: Adaptive Conservative Level in Q-Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16848v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL), which operates solely on static datasets without further interactions with the environment, provides an appealing alternative to learning a safe and promising control policy. The prevailing methods typically learn a conservative policy to mitigate the problem of Q-value overestimation, but it is prone to overdo it, leading to an overly conservative policy. Moreover, they optimize all samples equally with fixed constraints, lacking the nuanced ability to control conservative levels in a fine-grained manner. Consequently, this limitation results in a performance decline. To address the above two challenges in a united way, we propose a framework, Adaptive Conservative Level in Q-Learning (ACL-QL), which limits the Q-values in a mild range and enables adaptive control on the conservative level over each state-action pair, i.e., lifting the Q-values more for good transitions and less for bad transitions. We theoretically analyze the conditions under which the conservative level of the learned Q-function can be limited in a mild range and how to optimize each transition adaptively. Motivated by the theoretical analysis, we propose a novel algorithm, ACL-QL, which uses two learnable adaptive weight functions to control the conservative level over each transition. Subsequently, we design a monotonicity loss and surrogate losses to train the adaptive weight functions, Q-function, and policy network alternatively. We evaluate ACL-QL on the commonly used D4RL benchmark and conduct extensive ablation studies to illustrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance compared to existing offline DRL baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 4 figures, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (2024)</p></details> |
| **[Learning from Imperfect Demonstrations with Self-Supervision for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08957v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving data utilization, especially for imperfect data from task failures, is crucial for robotic manipulation due to the challenging, time-consuming, and expensive data collection process in the real world. Current imitation learning (IL) typically discards imperfect data, focusing solely on successful expert data. While reinforcement learning (RL) can learn from explorations and failures, the sim2real gap and its reliance on dense reward and online exploration make it difficult to apply effectively in real-world scenarios. In this work, we aim to conquer the challenge of leveraging imperfect data without the need for reward information to improve the model performance for robotic manipulation in an offline manner. Specifically, we introduce a Self-Supervised Data Filtering framework (SSDF) that combines expert and imperfect data to compute quality scores for failed trajectory segments. High-quality segments from the failed data are used to expand the training dataset. Then, the enhanced dataset can be used with any downstream policy learning method for robotic manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on the ManiSkill2 benchmark built on the high-fidelity Sapien simulator and real-world robotic manipulation tasks using the Franka robot arm demonstrated that the SSDF can accurately expand the training dataset with high-quality imperfect data and improve the success rates for all robotic manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

There is a research gap on how to comprehensively evaluate and optimize the security performance of semantic communication. In order to fill this gap, a unified semantic security metric, the cross-layer semantic secure rate (CLSSR), is defined to estimate cross-layer security requirements at both the physical layer and the application layer. Then, we formulate the maximization problem of the CLSSR with the mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). We propose a hierarchical AI-native semantic secure communication network with a reinforcement learning (RL)-based semantic resource allocation scheme, aiming to ensure the cross-layer semantic security (CL-SS). Finally, we prove the convergence of our proposed intelligent resource allocation, and the simulation results demonstrate that our proposed CLSS method outperforms the traditional physical layer semantic security (PL-SS) method in terms of both task reliability and CLSSR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning: A Case Study on Audio Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11197v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to greatly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), and RL-based approaches have been progressively applied to visual multimodal tasks. However, the audio modality has largely been overlooked in these developments. Thus, we conduct a series of RL explorations in audio understanding and reasoning, specifically focusing on the audio question answering (AQA) task. We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct, and our experiments demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the MMAU Test-mini benchmark, achieving an accuracy rate of 64.5%. The main findings in this technical report are as follows: 1) The GRPO algorithm can be effectively applied to large audio language models (LALMs), even when the model has only 8.2B parameters; 2) With only 38k post-training samples, RL significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning (SFT), indicating that RL-based approaches can be effective without large datasets; 3) The explicit reasoning process has not shown significant benefits for AQA tasks, and how to efficiently utilize deep thinking remains an open question for further research; 4) LALMs still lag far behind humans auditory-language reasoning, suggesting that the RL-based approaches warrant further exploration.

| **[A Reinforcement Learning-Driven Transformer GAN for Molecular Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12796v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating molecules with desired chemical properties presents a critical challenge in fields such as chemical synthesis and drug discovery. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have significantly contributed to data-driven molecular generation. However, challenges persist due to the inherent sensitivity of simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) representations and the difficulties in applying generative adversarial networks (GANs) to discrete data. This study introduces RL-MolGAN, a novel Transformer-based discrete GAN framework designed to address these challenges. Unlike traditional Transformer architectures, RL-MolGAN utilizes a first-decoder-then-encoder structure, facilitating the generation of drug-like molecules from both $de~novo$ and scaffold-based designs. In addition, RL-MolGAN integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) techniques to enhance the stability of GAN training and optimize the chemical properties of the generated molecules. To further improve the model's performance, RL-MolWGAN, an extension of RL-MolGAN, incorporates Wasserstein distance and mini-batch discrimination, which together enhance the stability of the GAN. Experimental results on two widely used molecular datasets, QM9 and ZINC, validate the effectiveness of our models in generating high-quality molecular structures with diverse and desirable chemical properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing sequential activity and travel decisions with interpretable deep inverse reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12761v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Travel demand modeling has shifted from aggregated trip-based models to behavior-oriented activity-based models because daily trips are essentially driven by human activities. To analyze the sequential activity-travel decisions, deep inverse reinforcement learning (DIRL) has proven effective in learning the decision mechanisms by approximating a reward function to represent preferences and a policy function to replicate observed behavior using deep neural networks (DNNs). However, most existing research has focused on using DIRL to enhance only prediction accuracy, with limited exploration into interpreting the underlying decision mechanisms guiding sequential decision-making. To address this gap, we introduce an interpretable DIRL framework for analyzing activity-travel decision processes, bridging the gap between data-driven machine learning and theory-driven behavioral models. Our proposed framework adapts an adversarial IRL approach to infer the reward and policy functions of activity-travel behavior. The policy function is interpreted through a surrogate interpretable model based on choice probabilities from the policy function, while the reward function is interpreted by deriving both short-term rewards and long-term returns for various activity-travel patterns. Our analysis of real-world travel survey data reveals promising results in two key areas: (i) behavioral pattern insights from the policy function, highlighting critical factors in decision-making and variations among socio-demographic groups, and (ii) behavioral preference insights from the reward function, indicating the utility individuals gain from specific activity sequences.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce RAG-RL, the first reasoning language model (RLM) specifically trained for RAG. RAG-RL demonstrates that stronger answer generation models can identify relevant contexts within larger sets of retrieved information -- thereby alleviating the burden on retrievers -- while also being able to utilize those contexts more effectively. Moreover, we show that curriculum design in the reinforcement learning (RL) post-training process is a powerful approach to enhancing model performance. We benchmark our method on two open-domain question-answering datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous SOTA generative reader models. In addition, we offers empirical insights into various curriculum learning strategies, providing a deeper understanding of their impact on model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 Pa...</summary><p>11 Pages, 3 Figures, Preprint</p></details> |
| **[SafeSlice: Enabling SLA-Compliant O-RAN Slicing via Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12753v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based slicing policies have shown significant success in simulated environments but face challenges in physical systems such as open radio access networks (O-RANs) due to simulation-to-reality gaps. These policies often lack safety guarantees to ensure compliance with service level agreements (SLAs), such as the strict latency requirements of immersive applications. As a result, a deployed DRL slicing agent may make resource allocation (RA) decisions that degrade system performance, particularly in previously unseen scenarios. Real-world immersive applications require maintaining SLA constraints throughout deployment to prevent risky DRL exploration. In this paper, we propose SafeSlice to address both the cumulative (trajectory-wise) and instantaneous (state-wise) latency constraints of O-RAN slices. We incorporate the cumulative constraints by designing a sigmoid-based risk-sensitive reward function that reflects the slices' latency requirements. Moreover, we build a supervised learning cost model as part of a safety layer that projects the slicing agent's RA actions to the nearest safe actions, fulfilling instantaneous constraints. We conduct an exhaustive experiment that supports multiple services, including real virtual reality (VR) gaming traffic, to investigate the performance of SafeSlice under extreme and changing deployment conditions. SafeSlice achieves reductions of up to 83.23% in average cumulative latency, 93.24% in instantaneous latency violations, and 22.13% in resource consumption compared to the baselines. The results also indicate SafeSlice's robustness to changing the threshold configurations of latency constraints, a vital deployment scenario that will be realized by the O-RAN paradigm to empower mobile network operators (MNOs).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for presentation in the IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning for Communication and Networking (ICMLCN) 2025</p></details> |

While previous research has primarily foucus on the classification of image and reinforcement learning. In our paper, we put forward novel diffusion policy model based on Spiking Transformer Neural Networks and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM): Spiking Transformer Modulate Diffusion Policy Model (STMDP), a new brain-inspired model for generating robot action trajectories. In order to improve the performance of this model, we develop a novel decoder module: Spiking Modulate De coder (SMD), which replaces the traditional Decoder module within the Transformer architecture. Additionally, we explored the substitution of DDPM with Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) in our frame work. We conducted experiments across four robotic manipulation tasks and performed ablation studies on the modulate block. Our model consistently outperforms existing Transformer-based diffusion policy method. Especially in Can task, we achieved an improvement of 8%. The proposed STMDP method integrates SNNs, dffusion model and Transformer architecture, which offers new perspectives and promising directions for exploration in brain-inspired robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures and 2 tables, conference submission</p></details> |
| **[APF+: Boosting adaptive-potential function reinforcement learning methods with a W-shaped network for high-dimensional games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13557v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studies in reward shaping for reinforcement learning (RL) have flourished in recent years due to its ability to speed up training. Our previous work proposed an adaptive potential function (APF) and showed that APF can accelerate the Q-learning with a Multi-layer Perceptron algorithm in the low-dimensional domain. This paper proposes to extend APF with an encoder (APF+) for RL state representation, allowing applying APF to the pixel-based Atari games using a state-encoding method that projects high-dimensional game's pixel frames to low-dimensional embeddings. We approach by designing the state-representation encoder as a W-shaped network (W-Net), by using which we are able to encode both the background as well as the moving entities in the game frames. Specifically, the embeddings derived from the pre-trained W-Net consist of two latent vectors: One represents the input state, and the other represents the deviation of the input state's representation from itself. We then incorporate W-Net into APF to train a downstream Dueling Deep Q-Network (DDQN), obtain the APF-WNet-DDQN, and demonstrate its effectiveness in Atari game-playing tasks. To evaluate the APF+W-Net module in such high-dimensional tasks, we compare with two types of baseline methods: (i) the basic DDQN; and (ii) two encoder-replaced APF-DDQN methods where we replace W-Net by (a) an unsupervised state representation method called Spatiotemporal Deep Infomax (ST-DIM) and (b) a ground truth state representation provided by the Atari Annotated RAM Interface (ARI). The experiment results show that out of 20 Atari games, APF-WNet-DDQN outperforms DDQN (14/20 games) and APF-STDIM-DDQN (13/20 games) significantly. In comparison against the APF-ARI-DDQN which employs embeddings directly of the detailed game-internal state information, the APF-WNet-DDQN achieves a comparable performance.</p></details> | 46 pages |

Sparse-angle tomography plays a significant role in this by reducing the required number of projections, thereby accelerating processing and conserving resources. Most existing methods aim to balance reconstruction quality and scanning time, typically relying on fixed scan durations. Adaptive adjustment of the number of angles is essential; for instance, more angles may be required for objects with complex geometries or noisier projections. The concept of optimal stopping, which dynamically adjusts this balance according to varying industrial needs, remains underutilized. Building on our previous work, we integrate optimal stopping into sequential Optimal Experimental Design (OED). We propose a novel method for computing the policy gradient within the Actor-Critic framework, enabling the development of adaptive policies for informative angle selection and scan termination. Additionally, we investigated the gap between simulation and real-world applications in the context of the developed learning-based method. Our trained model, developed using synthetic data, demonstrates reliable performance when applied to real-world data. This approach enhances the flexibility of CT operations and expands the applicability of sparse-angle tomography in industrial settings.</p></details> |  |

Task replication can improve reliability by duplicating a task's execution to handle transient and permanent faults, but blindly applying replication often leads to excessive overhead and higher temperatures. Existing design-time methods typically choose the number of replicas based on worst-case conditions, which can waste resources under normal operation. In this paper, we present RL-TIME, a reinforcement learning-based approach that dynamically decides the number of replicas according to actual system conditions. By considering both the reliability target and a core-level Thermal Safe Power (TSP) constraint at run-time, RL-TIME adapts the replication strategy to avoid unnecessary overhead and overheating. Experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, RL-TIME reduces power consumption by 63%, increases schedulability by 53%, and respects TSP 72% more often.</p></details> |  |
| **[TuneNSearch: a hybrid transfer learning and local search approach for solving vehicle routing problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12662v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces TuneNSearch, a hybrid transfer learning and local search approach for addressing different variants of vehicle routing problems (VRP). Recently, multi-task learning has gained much attention for solving VRP variants. However, this adaptability often compromises the performance of the models. To address this challenge, we first pre-train a reinforcement learning model on the multi-depot VRP, followed by a short fine-tuning phase to adapt it to different variants. By leveraging the complexity of the multi-depot VRP, the pre-trained model learns richer node representations and gains more transferable knowledge compared to models trained on simpler routing problems, such as the traveling salesman problem. TuneNSearch employs, in the first stage, a Transformer-based architecture, augmented with a residual edge-graph attention network to capture the impact of edge distances and residual connections between layers. This architecture allows for a more precise capture of graph-structured data, improving the encoding of VRP's features. After inference, our model is also coupled with a second stage composed of a local search algorithm, which yields substantial performance gains with minimal computational overhead added. Results show that TuneNSearch outperforms many existing state-of-the-art models trained for each VRP variant, requiring only one-fifth of the training epochs. Our approach demonstrates strong generalization, achieving high performance across different tasks, distributions and problem sizes, thus addressing a long-standing gap in the literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Mediated Guidance of MARL Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13553v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex multi-agent environments, achieving efficient learning and desirable behaviours is a significant challenge for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems. This work explores the potential of combining MARL with Large Language Model (LLM)-mediated interventions to guide agents toward more desirable behaviours. Specifically, we investigate how LLMs can be used to interpret and facilitate interventions that shape the learning trajectories of multiple agents. We experimented with two types of interventions, referred to as controllers: a Natural Language (NL) Controller and a Rule-Based (RB) Controller. The NL Controller, which uses an LLM to simulate human-like interventions, showed a stronger impact than the RB Controller. Our findings indicate that agents particularly benefit from early interventions, leading to more efficient training and higher performance. Both intervention types outperform the baseline without interventions, highlighting the potential of LLM-mediated guidance to accelerate training and enhance MARL performance in challenging environments.</p></details> | 31 pages, 50 figures |
| **[Doubly Inhomogeneous Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03983v3)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies reinforcement learning (RL) in doubly inhomogeneous environments under temporal non-stationarity and subject heterogeneity. In a number of applications, it is commonplace to encounter datasets generated by system dynamics that may change over time and population, challenging high-quality sequential decision making. Nonetheless, most existing RL solutions require either temporal stationarity or subject homogeneity, which would result in sub-optimal policies if both assumptions were violated. To address both challenges simultaneously, we propose an original algorithm to determine the ``best data chunks" that display similar dynamics over time and across individuals for policy learning, which alternates between most recent change point detection and cluster identification. Our method is general, and works with a wide range of clustering and change point detection algorithms. It is multiply robust in the sense that it takes multiple initial estimators as input and only requires one of them to be consistent. Moreover, by borrowing information over time and population, it allows us to detect weaker signals and has better convergence properties when compared to applying the clustering algorithm per time or the change point detection algorithm per subject. Empirically, we demonstrate the usefulness of our method through extensive simulations and a real data application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Focusing Robot Open-Ended Reinforcement Learning Through Users' Purposes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12579v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Ended Learning (OEL) autonomous robots can acquire new skills and knowledge through direct interaction with their environment, relying on mechanisms such as intrinsic motivations and self-generated goals to guide learning processes. OEL robots are highly relevant for applications as they can autonomously leverage acquired knowledge to perform tasks beneficial to human users in unstructured environments, addressing challenges unforeseen at design time. However, OEL robots face a significant limitation: their openness may lead them to waste time learning information that is irrelevant to tasks desired by specific users. Here, we propose a solution called `Purpose-Directed Open-Ended Learning' (POEL), based on the novel concept of `purpose' introduced in previous work. A purpose specifies what users want the robot to achieve. The key insight of this work is that purpose can focus OEL on learning self-generated classes of tasks that, while unknown during autonomous learning (as typical in OEL), involve objects relevant to the purpose. This concept is operationalised in a novel robot architecture capable of receiving a human purpose through speech-to-text, analysing the scene to identify objects, and using a Large Language Model to reason about which objects are purpose-relevant. These objects are then used to bias OEL exploration towards their spatial proximity and to self-generate rewards that favour interactions with them. The solution is tested in a simulated scenario where a camera-arm-gripper robot interacts freely with purpose-related and distractor objects. For the first time, the results demonstrate the potential advantages of purpose-focused OEL over state-of-the-art OEL methods, enabling robots to handle unstructured environments while steering their learning toward knowledge acquisition relevant to users.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, accepted at RLDM 2025</p></details> |

However, whether multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can similarly comprehend the 4D world remains uncertain. This paper explores multimodal spatio-temporal reasoning from an egocentric perspective, aiming to equip MLLMs with human-like reasoning capabilities. To support this objective, we introduce Ego-ST Bench, a novel benchmark containing over 5,000 question-answer pairs across four categories, systematically evaluating spatial, temporal, and integrated spatio-temporal reasoning. Additionally, we propose the ST-R1 Video model, a video-based reasoning model that incorporates reverse thinking into its reinforcement learning process, significantly enhancing performance. We combine long-chain-of-thought (long-CoT) supervised fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning, achieving notable improvements with limited high-quality data. Ego-ST Bench and ST-R1 provide valuable insights and resources for advancing video-based spatio-temporal reasoning research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Step Reward Models for Enhanced Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13551v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies show that Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. However, a key approach, the Process Reward Model (PRM), suffers from reward hacking, making it unreliable in identifying the best intermediate steps. In this paper, we propose a novel reward model approach, Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM), which evaluates both individual and consecutive reasoning steps from fine-grained and coarse-grained level. HRM performs better in assessing reasoning coherence and self-reflection, particularly when the previous reasoning step is incorrect. Furthermore, to address the inefficiency of autonomous generating PRM training data via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we introduce a lightweight and effective data augmentation strategy called Hierarchical Node Compression (HNC) based on node merging (combining two consecutive reasoning steps into one step) in the tree structure. This approach diversifies MCTS results for HRM with negligible computational overhead, enhancing label robustness by introducing noise. Empirical results on the PRM800K dataset demonstrate that HRM, in conjunction with HNC, achieves superior stability and reliability in evaluation compared to PRM. Furthermore, cross-domain evaluations on MATH500 and GSM8K confirm HRM's superior generalization and robustness across diverse reasoning tasks. The code for all experiments will be released at https: //github.com/tengwang0318/hierarchial_reward_model.</p></details> |  |

The inherent locomotion constraints of bipedal robots challenge their safe maneuvering capabilities in dynamic environments. When combined with the intricacies of social environments, including pedestrian interactions and social cues, such as emotions, these challenges become even more pronounced. To address these coupled problems, we propose a two-stage pipeline that considers both bipedal locomotion constraints and complex social environments. Specifically, social navigation scenarios are represented using sequential LiDAR grid maps (LGMs), from which we extract latent features, including collision regions, emotion-related discomfort zones, social interactions, and the spatio-temporal dynamics of evolving environments. The extracted features are directly mapped to the actions of reduced-order models (ROMs) through a DRL architecture. Furthermore, the proposed framework incorporates full-order dynamics and locomotion constraints during training, effectively accounting for tracking errors and restrictions of the locomotion controller while planning the trajectory with ROMs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach exceeds both model-based planners and DRL-based baselines. The hardware videos and open-source code are available at https://gatech-lidar.github.io/emobipednav.github.io/.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Recently, process-level reward models (PRMs) were proposed to provide step-wise rewards that facilitate reinforcement learning and data production during training and guide LLMs toward correct steps during inference, thereby improving reasoning accuracy. However, existing benchmarks of PRMs are text-based and focus on error detection, neglecting other scenarios like reasoning search. To address this gap, we introduce MPBench, a comprehensive, multi-task, multimodal benchmark designed to systematically assess the effectiveness of PRMs in diverse scenarios. MPBench employs three evaluation paradigms, each targeting a specific role of PRMs in the reasoning process: (1) Step Correctness, which assesses the correctness of each intermediate reasoning step; (2) Answer Aggregation, which aggregates multiple solutions and selects the best one; and (3) Reasoning Process Search, which guides the search for optimal reasoning steps during inference. Through these paradigms, MPBench makes comprehensive evaluations and provides insights into the development of multimodal PRMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive AUV Hunting Policy with Covert Communication via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13547v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative underwater target hunting, facilitated by multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), plays a significant role in various domains, especially military missions. Existing research predominantly focuses on designing efficient and high-success-rate hunting policy, particularly addressing the target's evasion capabilities. However, in real-world scenarios, the target can not only adjust its evasion policy based on its observations and predictions but also possess eavesdropping capabilities. If communication among hunter AUVs, such as hunting policy exchanges, is intercepted by the target, it can adapt its escape policy accordingly, significantly reducing the success rate of the hunting mission. To address this challenge, we propose a covert communication-guaranteed collaborative target hunting framework, which ensures efficient hunting in complex underwater environments while defending against the target's eavesdropping. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to incorporate the confidentiality of inter-agent communication into the design of target hunting policy. Furthermore, given the complexity of coordinating multiple AUVs in dynamic and unpredictable environments, we propose an adaptive multi-agent diffusion policy (AMADP), which incorporates the strong generative ability of diffusion models into the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that AMADP achieves faster convergence and higher hunting success rates while maintaining covertness constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 1 tables, Published at ICC 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on the Optimization of Large Language Model-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12434v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have been widely adopted in various fields, becoming essential for autonomous decision-making and interactive tasks. However, current work typically relies on prompt design or fine-tuning strategies applied to vanilla LLMs, which often leads to limited effectiveness or suboptimal performance in complex agent-related environments. Although LLM optimization techniques can improve model performance across many general tasks, they lack specialized optimization towards critical agent functionalities such as long-term planning, dynamic environmental interaction, and complex decision-making. Although numerous recent studies have explored various strategies to optimize LLM-based agents for complex agent tasks, a systematic review summarizing and comparing these methods from a holistic perspective is still lacking. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of LLM-based agent optimization approaches, categorizing them into parameter-driven and parameter-free methods. We first focus on parameter-driven optimization, covering fine-tuning-based optimization, reinforcement learning-based optimization, and hybrid strategies, analyzing key aspects such as trajectory data construction, fine-tuning techniques, reward function design, and optimization algorithms. Additionally, we briefly discuss parameter-free strategies that optimize agent behavior through prompt engineering and external knowledge retrieval. Finally, we summarize the datasets and benchmarks used for evaluation and tuning, review key applications of LLM-based agents, and discuss major challenges and promising future directions.

While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown its promise in addressing PE tasks, research has primarily focused on single-target pursuit, with limited exploration of multi-target encirclement, particularly in large-scale settings. This paper proposes a Transformer-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning (TERL) framework for large-scale multi-target encirclement. By integrating a transformer-based policy network with target selection, TERL enables robots to adaptively prioritize targets and safely coordinate robots. Results show that TERL outperforms existing RL-based methods in terms of encirclement success rate and task completion time, while maintaining good performance in large-scale scenarios.

The state-action pairs generated by any fixed behavioral policy thus follow a Markov chain, and the {\em empirical} state-action-next-state distribution satisfies a large deviations principle. We use the rate function of this large deviations principle to construct an uncertainty set for the unknown {\em true} state-action-next-state distribution. We also construct a distribution shift transformation that maps any distribution in this uncertainty set to a state-action-next-state distribution of the Markov chain generated by a fixed evaluation policy, which may differ from the unknown behavioral policy. We prove that the worst-case average reward of the evaluation policy with respect to all distributions in the shifted uncertainty set provides, in a rigorous statistical sense, the least conservative estimator for the average reward under the unknown true distribution. This guarantee is available even if one has only access to one single trajectory of serially correlated state-action pairs. The emerging robust optimization problem can be viewed as a robust Markov decision process with a non-rectangular uncertainty set. We adapt an efficient policy gradient algorithm to solve this problem. Numerical experiments show that our methods compare favorably against state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Demonstrations to Rewards: Alignment Without Explicit Human Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13538v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the challenges of aligning large models with human preferences lies in both the data requirements and the technical complexities of current approaches. Predominant methods, such as RLHF, involve multiple steps, each demanding distinct types of data, including demonstration data and preference data. In RLHF, human preferences are typically modeled through a reward model, which serves as a proxy to guide policy learning during the reinforcement learning stage, ultimately producing a policy aligned with human preferences. However, in this paper, we propose a fresh perspective on learning alignment based on inverse reinforcement learning principles, where the optimal policy is still derived from reward maximization. However, instead of relying on preference data, we directly learn the reward model from demonstration data. This new formulation offers the flexibility to be applied even when only demonstration data is available, a capability that current RLHF methods lack, and it also shows that demonstration data offers more utility than what conventional wisdom suggests. Our extensive evaluation, based on public reward benchmark, HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard and MT-Bench, demonstrates that our approach compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods that rely solely on demonstration data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation-Time Policy Switching for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12222v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) looks at learning how to optimally solve tasks using a fixed dataset of interactions from the environment. Many off-policy algorithms developed for online learning struggle in the offline setting as they tend to over-estimate the behaviour of out of distributions actions. Existing offline RL algorithms adapt off-policy algorithms, employing techniques such as constraining the policy or modifying the value function to achieve good performance on individual datasets but struggle to adapt to different tasks or datasets of different qualities without tuning hyper-parameters. We introduce a policy switching technique that dynamically combines the behaviour of a pure off-policy RL agent, for improving behaviour, and a behavioural cloning (BC) agent, for staying close to the data. We achieve this by using a combination of epistemic uncertainty, quantified by our RL model, and a metric for aleatoric uncertainty extracted from the dataset. We show empirically that our policy switching technique can outperform not only the individual algorithms used in the switching process but also compete with state-of-the-art methods on numerous benchmarks. Our use of epistemic uncertainty for policy switching also allows us to naturally extend our method to the domain of offline to online fine-tuning allowing our model to adapt quickly and safely from online data, either matching or exceeding the performance of current methods that typically require additional modification or hyper-parameter fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proc....</summary><p>Proc. of the 24th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Long-Short Portfolio Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13773v8)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, data-driven methods effectively overcome limitations in traditional portfolio optimization. Conventional models primarily employ long-only mechanisms, excluding highly correlated assets to diversify risk. However, incorporating short-selling enables low-risk arbitrage through hedging correlated assets. This paper constructs a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) portfolio management framework with short-selling mechanisms conforming to actual trading rules, exploring strategies for excess returns in China's A-share market. Key innovations include: (1) Development of a comprehensive short-selling mechanism in continuous trading that accounts for dynamic evolution of transactions across time periods; (2) Design of a long-short optimization framework integrating deep neural networks for processing multi-dimensional financial time series with mean Sharpe ratio reward functions. Empirical results show the DRL model with short-selling demonstrates significant optimization capabilities, achieving consistent positive returns during backtesting periods. Compared to traditional approaches, this model delivers superior risk-adjusted returns while reducing maximum drawdown. From an allocation perspective, the DRL model establishes a robust investment style, enhancing defensive capabilities through strategic avoidance of underperforming assets and balanced capital allocation. This research contributes to portfolio theory while providing novel methodologies for quantitative investment practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[PLM: Efficient Peripheral Language Models Hardware-Co-Designed for Ubiquitous Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12167v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While scaling laws have been continuously validated in large language models (LLMs) with increasing model parameters, the inherent tension between the inference demands of LLMs and the limited resources of edge devices poses a critical challenge to the development of edge intelligence. Recently, numerous small language models have emerged, aiming to distill the capabilities of LLMs into smaller footprints. However, these models often retain the fundamental architectural principles of their larger counterparts, still imposing considerable strain on the storage and bandwidth capacities of edge devices. In this paper, we introduce the PLM, a Peripheral Language Model, developed through a co-design process that jointly optimizes model architecture and edge system constraints. The PLM utilizes a Multi-head Latent Attention mechanism and employs the squared ReLU activation function to encourage sparsity, thereby reducing peak memory footprint during inference. During training, we collect and reorganize open-source datasets, implement a multi-phase training strategy, and empirically investigate the Warmup-Stable-Decay-Constant (WSDC) learning rate scheduler. Additionally, we incorporate Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) by adopting the ARIES preference learning approach. Following a two-phase SFT process, this method yields performance gains of 2% in general tasks, 9% in the GSM8K task, and 11% in coding tasks. In addition to its novel architecture, evaluation results demonstrate that PLM outperforms existing small language models trained on publicly available data while maintaining the lowest number of activated parameters. Furthermore, deployment across various edge devices, including consumer-grade GPUs, mobile phones, and Raspberry Pis, validates PLM's suitability for peripheral applications. The PLM series models are publicly available at https://github.com/plm-team/PLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[ICCO: Learning an Instruction-conditioned Coordinator for Language-guided Task-aligned Multi-robot Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12122v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have permitted the development of language-guided multi-robot systems, which allow robots to execute tasks based on natural language instructions. However, achieving effective coordination in distributed multi-agent environments remains challenging due to (1) misalignment between instructions and task requirements and (2) inconsistency in robot behaviors when they independently interpret ambiguous instructions. To address these challenges, we propose Instruction-Conditioned Coordinator (ICCO), a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework designed to enhance coordination in language-guided multi-robot systems. ICCO consists of a Coordinator agent and multiple Local Agents, where the Coordinator generates Task-Aligned and Consistent Instructions (TACI) by integrating language instructions with environmental states, ensuring task alignment and behavioral consistency. The Coordinator and Local Agents are jointly trained to optimize a reward function that balances task efficiency and instruction following. A Consistency Enhancement Term is added to the learning objective to maximize mutual information between instructions and robot behaviors, further improving coordination. Simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of ICCO in achieving language-guided task-aligned multi-robot control. The demonstration can be found at https://yanoyoshiki.github.io/ICCO/.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

While classical assumptions such as strong convexity allow a simple analysis they are rarely satisfied in applications. In recent years, global and local gradient domination properties have shown to be a more realistic replacement of strong convexity. They were proved to hold in diverse settings such as (simple) policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning and training of deep neural networks with analytic activation functions. We prove almost sure convergence rates $f(X_n)-f^*\in o\big( n^{-\frac{1}{4\beta-1}+\epsilon}\big)$ of the last iterate for stochastic gradient descent (with and without momentum) under global and local $\beta$-gradient domination assumptions. The almost sure rates get arbitrarily close to recent rates in expectation. Finally, we demonstrate how to apply our results to the training task in both supervised and reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[TOP-ERL: Transformer-based Off-Policy Episodic Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09536v4)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces Transformer-based Off-Policy Episodic Reinforcement Learning (TOP-ERL), a novel algorithm that enables off-policy updates in the ERL framework. In ERL, policies predict entire action trajectories over multiple time steps instead of single actions at every time step. These trajectories are typically parameterized by trajectory generators such as Movement Primitives (MP), allowing for smooth and efficient exploration over long horizons while capturing high-level temporal correlations. However, ERL methods are often constrained to on-policy frameworks due to the difficulty of evaluating state-action values for entire action sequences, limiting their sample efficiency and preventing the use of more efficient off-policy architectures. TOP-ERL addresses this shortcoming by segmenting long action sequences and estimating the state-action values for each segment using a transformer-based critic architecture alongside an n-step return estimation. These contributions result in efficient and stable training that is reflected in the empirical results conducted on sophisticated robot learning environments. TOP-ERL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods. Thorough ablation studies additionally show the impact of key design choices on the model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Spotlight at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

This difficulty stems from the complex relationship between the threat levels of enemy units and their feature characteristics, which complicates the design of rule-based evaluators. Moreover, traditional supervised learning methods face the challenge of lacking explicit labels during training when applied to this threat evaluation problem. In this study, we redefine the threat evaluation problem as a reinforcement learning task and introduce an efficient evaluator training algorithm, Eval-PPO, based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. Eval-PPO integrates multidimensional enemy features and the state information of friendly units through systematic training, thereby achieving precise threat assessment. Compared with rule-based methods, Eval-PPO demonstrates a significant improvement in average success rate, with an increase of 17.84%.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Safe Mapless Navigation with Congestion Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12036v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning-based mapless navigation holds significant potential. However, it faces challenges in indoor environments with local minima area. This paper introduces a safe mapless navigation framework utilizing hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) to enhance navigation through such areas. The high-level policy creates a sub-goal to direct the navigation process. Notably, we have developed a sub-goal update mechanism that considers environment congestion, efficiently avoiding the entrapment of the robot in local minimum areas. The low-level motion planning policy, trained through safe reinforcement learning, outputs real-time control instructions based on acquired sub-goal. Specifically, to enhance the robot's environmental perception, we introduce a new obstacle encoding method that evaluates the impact of obstacles on the robot's motion planning. To validate the performance of our HRL-based navigation framework, we conduct simulations in office, home, and restaurant environments. The findings demonstrate that our HRL-based navigation framework excels in both static and dynamic scenarios. Finally, we implement the HRL-based navigation framework on a TurtleBot3 robot for physical validation experiments, which exhibits its strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

| **[Physically-Consistent Parameter Identification of Robots in Contact](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09850v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate inertial parameter identification is crucial for the simulation and control of robots encountering intermittent contact with the environment. Classically, robots' inertial parameters are obtained from CAD models that are not precise (and sometimes not available, e.g., Spot from Boston Dynamics), hence requiring identification. To do that, existing methods require access to contact force measurement, a modality not present in modern quadruped and humanoid robots. This paper presents an alternative technique that utilizes joint current/torque measurements -- a standard sensing modality in modern robots -- to identify inertial parameters without requiring direct contact force measurements. By projecting the whole-body dynamics into the null space of contact constraints, we eliminate the dependency on contact forces and reformulate the identification problem as a linear matrix inequality that can handle physical and geometrical constraints. We compare our proposed method against a common black-box identification method using a deep neural network and show that incorporating physical consistency significantly improves the sample efficiency and generalizability of the model. Finally, we validate our method on the Spot quadruped robot across various locomotion tasks, showcasing its accuracy and generalizability in real-world scenarios over different gaits.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

We evaluate our method in both simulation and on the real Toyota Human Support Robot (HSR). Our method achieves a 93% success rate in the 'fetch me' task completion with failure recovery, highlighting its capability in both failure reasoning and task planning. InteLiPlan achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art large-scale LLM-based robotics planners, while using only real-time onboard computing.</p></details> |  |

The design prioritizes enhanced locomotion capabilities, improved reliability and safety of the actuation system, and simplified, cost-effective manufacturing processes. Locomotion performance is optimized through a sandwiched leg design and a dual-motor configuration, reducing leg inertia for agile movements. Reliability and safety are achieved by integrating robust cable strain reliefs, efficient heat sinks for motor thermal management, and mechanical limits to restrict leg motion. Simplified design considerations include a quasi-direct drive (QDD) actuator and the adoption of low-cost fabrication techniques, such as laser cutting and 3D printing, to minimize cost and ensure rapid prototyping. The robot weighs approximately 25 kg and is developed at a cost under \$8000, making it a scalable and affordable solution for robotics research. Experimental validations demonstrate the platform's capability to execute trot and crawl gaits on flat terrain and slopes, highlighting its potential as a versatile and reliable quadruped research platform.</p></details> | 6 pages, 9 figures |
| **[CTSAC: Curriculum-Based Transformer Soft Actor-Critic for Goal-Oriented Robot Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14254v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing demand for efficient and flexible robotic exploration solutions, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is becoming a promising approach in the field of autonomous robotic exploration. However, current RL-based exploration algorithms often face limited environmental reasoning capabilities, slow convergence rates, and substantial challenges in Sim-To-Real (S2R) transfer. To address these issues, we propose a Curriculum Learning-based Transformer Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (CTSAC) aimed at improving both exploration efficiency and transfer performance. To enhance the robot's reasoning ability, a Transformer is integrated into the perception network of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework, leveraging historical information to improve the farsightedness of the strategy. A periodic review-based curriculum learning is proposed, which enhances training efficiency while mitigating catastrophic forgetting during curriculum transitions. Training is conducted on the ROS-Gazebo continuous robotic simulation platform, with LiDAR clustering optimization to further reduce the S2R gap. Experimental results demonstrate the CTSAC algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art non-learning and learning-based algorithms in terms of success rate and success rate-weighted exploration time. Moreover, real-world experiments validate the strong S2R transfer capabilities of CTSAC.</p></details> | <details><summary>7page...</summary><p>7pages,7 figures,Thesis received by 2025 ICRA</p></details> |

Additionally, we propose a robust pose initialization method for fast locomotion and IMU error in legged robots, integrating IMU/Legged odometry, inter-frame Perspective-n-Point (PnP), and Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP). Furthermore, a novel optimization framework that tightly couples depth-to-map and GICP geometric constraints is first introduced to improve the robustness and accuracy in long-duration, visually texture-less environments. The proposed algorithms achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on collected legged robots and open-source datasets.

An intuitive way for humans to express these goals is through abstract cues like verbal commands or rough sketches. Such human guidance may lack details or be noisy. Nonetheless, we expect robots to navigate as intended. For robots to interpret and execute these abstract instructions in line with human expectations, they must share a common understanding of basic navigation concepts with humans. To this end, we introduce CANVAS, a novel framework that combines visual and linguistic instructions for commonsense-aware navigation. Its success is driven by imitation learning, enabling the robot to learn from human navigation behavior. We present COMMAND, a comprehensive dataset with human-annotated navigation results, spanning over 48 hours and 219 km, designed to train commonsense-aware navigation systems in simulated environments. Our experiments show that CANVAS outperforms the strong rule-based system ROS NavStack across all environments, demonstrating superior performance with noisy instructions. Notably, in the orchard environment, where ROS NavStack records a 0% total success rate, CANVAS achieves a total success rate of 67%. CANVAS also closely aligns with human demonstrations and commonsense constraints, even in unseen environments. Furthermore, real-world deployment of CANVAS showcases impressive Sim2Real transfer with a total success rate of 69%, highlighting the potential of learning from human demonstrations in simulated environments for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025, project page https://worv-ai.github.io/canvas</p></details> |

We solve this problem by combining Conflict-Based Search (CBS), a multi-agent path finding method, and discontinuity-bounded A*, a single-robot kinodynamic motion planner. Our method, db-CBS, operates in three levels. Initially, we compute trajectories for individual robots using a graph search that allows bounded discontinuities between precomputed motion primitives. The second level identifies inter-robot collisions and resolves them by imposing constraints on the first level. The third and final level uses the resulting solution with discontinuities as an initial guess for a joint space trajectory optimization. The procedure is repeated with a reduced discontinuity bound. Our approach is anytime, probabilistically complete, asymptotically optimal, and finds near-optimal solutions quickly. Experimental results with robot dynamics such as unicycle, double integrator, and car with trailer in different settings show that our method is capable of solving challenging tasks with a higher success rate and lower cost than the existing state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICRA 2024</p></details> |

This paper introduces a novel Real-Sim-Real (RSR) loop framework leveraging differentiable simulation to address this gap by iteratively refining simulation parameters, aligning them with real-world conditions, and enabling robust and efficient policy transfer. A key contribution of our work is the design of an informative cost function that encourages the collection of diverse and representative real-world data, minimizing bias and maximizing the utility of each data point for simulation refinement. This cost function integrates seamlessly into existing reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC) and ensures a balanced exploration of critical regions in the real domain. Furthermore, our approach is implemented on the versatile Mujoco MJX platform, and our framework is compatible with a wide range of robotic systems. Experimental results on several robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the sim-to-real gap, achieving high task performance and generalizability across diverse scenarios of both explicit and implicit environmental uncertainties.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional deep learning and Transformer models often struggle to process data with inherent symmetries and invariances, typically relying on large datasets or extensive data augmentation. Equivariant neural networks overcome these limitations by explicitly integrating symmetry and invariance into their architectures, leading to improved efficiency and generalization. This tutorial survey reviews a wide range of equivariant deep learning and control methods for robotics, from classic to state-of-the-art, with a focus on SE(3)-equivariant models that leverage the natural 3D rotational and translational symmetries in visual robotic manipulation and control design. Using unified mathematical notation, we begin by reviewing key concepts from group theory, along with matrix Lie groups and Lie algebras. We then introduce foundational group-equivariant neural network design and show how the group-equivariance can be obtained through their structure. Next, we discuss the applications of SE(3)-equivariant neural networks in robotics in terms of imitation learning and reinforcement learning. The SE(3)-equivariant control design is also reviewed from the perspective of geometric control. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions of equivariant methods in developing more robust, sample-efficient, and multi-modal real-world robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to International Journcal of Control, Automation and Systems (IJCAS), Under Review</p></details> |

Inspired by the Mount Lyell salamander's ability to curl its body into a loop and effectively roll down {\Revision hill slopes}, in this study we develop a sand-rolling robot and investigate how its locomotion performance is governed by the shape of its body. We experimentally tested three different body shapes: Hexagon, Quadrilateral, and Triangle. We found that Hexagon and Triangle can achieve a faster rolling speed on sand, but exhibited more frequent failures of getting stuck. Analysis of the interaction between robot and sand revealed the failure mechanism: the deformation of the sand produced a local ``sand incline'' underneath robot contact segments, increasing the effective region of supporting polygon (ERSP) and preventing the robot from shifting its center of mass (CoM) outside the ERSP to produce sustainable rolling. Based on this mechanism, a highly-simplified model successfully captured the critical body pitch for each rolling shape to produce sustained rolling on sand, and informed design adaptations that mitigated the locomotion failures and improved robot speed by more than 200$\%$. Our results provide insights into how locomotors can utilize different morphological features to achieve robust rolling motion across deformable substrates.</p></details> |  |

These products often contain a mix of compliant and rigid components, making robotic disassembly a critical step toward achieving scalable recycling processes. Diffusion policy has emerged as a promising approach for learning low-level skills in robotics. To effectively apply diffusion policy to contact-rich tasks, incorporating force as feedback is essential. In this paper, we apply diffusion policy with vision and force in a compliant object prying task. However, when combining low-dimensional contact force with high-dimensional image, the force information may be diluted. To address this issue, we propose a method that effectively integrates force with image data for diffusion policy observations. We validate our approach on a battery prying task that demands high precision and multi-step execution. Our model achieves a 96\% success rate in diverse scenarios, marking a 57\% improvement over the vision-only baseline. Our method also demonstrates zero-shot transfer capability to handle unseen objects and battery types.

| **[Automatic MILP Model Construction for Multi-Robot Task Allocation and Scheduling Based on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13813v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the accelerated development of Industry 4.0, intelligent manufacturing systems increasingly require efficient task allocation and scheduling in multi-robot systems. However, existing methods rely on domain expertise and face challenges in adapting to dynamic production constraints. Additionally, enterprises have high privacy requirements for production scheduling data, which prevents the use of cloud-based large language models (LLMs) for solution development. To address these challenges, there is an urgent need for an automated modeling solution that meets data privacy requirements. This study proposes a knowledge-augmented mixed integer linear programming (MILP) automated formulation framework, integrating local LLMs with domain-specific knowledge bases to generate executable code from natural language descriptions automatically. The framework employs a knowledge-guided DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model to extract complex spatiotemporal constraints (82% average accuracy) and leverages a supervised fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct model for efficient MILP code generation (90% average accuracy). Experimental results demonstrate that the framework successfully achieves automatic modeling in the aircraft skin manufacturing case while ensuring data privacy and computational efficiency. This research provides a low-barrier and highly reliable technical path for modeling in complex industrial scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, obtaining high-quality demonstration data is critical for the success of data-driven approaches, such as imitation learning. Existing platforms for robot control and data collection in manipulation tasks often place significant physical and mental demands on the user, require additional hardware, or necessitate specialized knowledge. In this work, we introduce a novel augmented reality interface for teleoperating robotic manipulators, focusing on the user experience, particularly when performing complex, precise tasks. Designed for the Microsoft HoloLens 2, this interface leverages the adaptability of mixed reality, allowing users to control a physical robot via a digital end effector surrogate. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across four complex manipulation tasks and compare its performance with the 3D SpaceMouse, a traditional teleoperation method in robotics, and kinesthetic teaching, the assumed performance upperbound in robotic control. Our findings reveal that, quantitatively, our method addresses a key limitation of the SpaceMouse: its unintuitive mapping of rotations. Additionally, a user study demonstrates that our AR-based system achieves higher usability scores and recommendation likelihood, and lower task load compared to the SpaceMouse.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

While safety-critical control techniques, such as Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), have been proposed to ensure safety, their effectiveness relies on the assumption that the robot has complete knowledge of its surroundings. In reality, robots often operate with restricted field-of-view and finite sensing range, which can lead to collisions with unknown obstacles if the planner is agnostic to these limitations. To address this issue, we introduce the Visibility-Aware RRT* algorithm that combines sampling-based planning with CBFs to generate safe and efficient global reference paths in partially unknown environments. The algorithm incorporates a collision avoidance CBF and a novel visibility CBF, which guarantees that the robot remains within locally collision-free regions, enabling timely detection and avoidance of unknown obstacles. We conduct extensive experiments interfacing the path planners with two different safety-critical controllers, wherein our method outperforms all other compared baselines across both safety and efficiency aspects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (to be presented at IROS 2025).

Manual creation of spherical models is time-consuming and prone to errors. This paper presents Foam, a tool to generate spherical approximations of robot geometry from an input Universal Robot Description Format (URDF) file. Foam provides a robust preprocessing pipeline to handle mesh defects and a number of configuration parameters to control the level and approximation of the spherization, and generates an output URDF with collision geometry specified only by spheres. We demonstrate Foam on a number of standard robot models on common tasks, and demonstrate improved collision checking and distance query performance with only a minor loss in fidelity compared to the true collision geometry. We release our tool as an open source Python library and containerized command-line application to facilitate adoption across the robotics community.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

However, existing surgeon consoles are bulky, take up valuable space in the operating room, make surgical team coordination challenging, and their proprietary nature makes it difficult to take advantage of recent technological advances, especially in virtual and augmented reality. One potential area for further improvement is the integration of modern sensory gloves into robotic platforms, allowing surgeons to control robotic arms intuitively with their hand movements. We propose one such system that combines an HTC Vive tracker, a Manus Meta Prime 3 XR sensory glove, and SCOPEYE wireless smart glasses. The system controls one arm of a da Vinci surgical robot. In addition to moving the arm, the surgeon can use fingers to control the end-effector of the surgical instrument. Hand gestures are used to implement clutching and similar functions. In particular, we introduce clutching of the instrument orientation, a functionality unavailable in the da Vinci system. The vibrotactile elements of the glove are used to provide feedback to the user when gesture commands are invoked. A qualitative and quantitative evaluation has been conducted that compares the current device with the dVRK console. The system is shown to have excellent tracking accuracy, and the new interface allows surgeons to perform common surgical training tasks with minimal practice efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables, submitted to International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |

This paper presents a modular robotic system in which each module has independent actuation, battery power, and control, allowing both individual mobility and coordinated locomotion. A hierarchical Central Pattern Generator (CPG) framework governs motion, with a low-level CPG controlling individual modules and a high-level CPG synchronizing inter-module coordination, enabling smooth transitions between independent and collective behaviors. To validate the system, we conduct simulations in MuJoCo and hardware experiments, evaluating locomotion across different configurations. We first analyze single-module motion, followed by two-module cooperative locomotion. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the CPG-based control framework in achieving robust, flexible, and scalable locomotion. The proposed modular architecture has potential applications in search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and autonomous exploration, where adaptability and reconfigurability are essential.</p></details> |  |

Previous approaches based solely on formal methods are computationally expensive and cannot scale to large state spaces. In contrast, INPROVF uses LLMs to generate repair candidates, and formal methods to verify their correctness. To improve the quality of these candidates, our framework first translates the symbolic representations of the environment and controllers into natural language descriptions. If a candidate fails the verification, INPROVF provides feedback on potential unsafe behaviors or unsatisfied tasks, and iteratively prompts LLMs to generate improved solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of INPROVF through 12 violations with various workspaces, tasks, and state space sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICLR 2025 Workshop: VerifAI: AI Verification in the Wild; in submission to 2025 IEEE 21th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE), Los Angeles, CA, USA: IEEE, Aug. 2025</p></details> |

Analyzing data from 42 participants at SIGDIAL 2024, we extracted linguistic features such as disfluencies and syntactic complexity from conversation transcripts. The results showed moderate effect sizes, suggesting that participants produced fewer disfluencies and employed more complex syntax when interacting with ERICA. Further analysis involving training classification models like Na\"ive Bayes, which achieved an F1-score of 71.60\%, and conducting feature importance analysis, highlighted the significant role of disfluencies and syntactic complexity in interactions with robots of varying human-like appearances. Discussing these findings within the frameworks of cognitive load and Communication Accommodation Theory, we conclude that designing robots to elicit more structured and fluent user speech can enhance their communicative alignment with humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as Late-Breaking Work at CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI EA '25)</p></details> |

Traditional methods, such as robot-centric reinforcement learning (RL), imitation learning, and hybrid techniques, require massive training and often struggle to generalize across different objects and robot platforms. We propose a novel framework for learning object-centric manipulation policies in force space, decoupling the robot from the object. By directly applying forces to selected regions of the object, our method simplifies the action space, reduces unnecessary exploration, and decreases simulation overhead. This approach, trained in simulation on a small set of representative objects, captures object dynamics -- such as joint configurations -- allowing policies to generalize effectively to new, unseen objects. Decoupling these policies from robot-specific dynamics enables direct transfer to different robotic platforms (e.g., Kinova, Panda, UR5) without retraining. Our evaluations demonstrate that the method significantly outperforms baselines, achieving over an order of magnitude improvement in training efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, operating in force space enhances policy transferability across diverse robot platforms and object types. We further showcase the applicability of our method in a real-world robotic setting.

| **[Artificial Spacetimes for Reactive Control of Resource-Limited Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13355v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Field-based reactive control provides a minimalist, decentralized route to guiding robots that lack onboard computation. Such schemes are well suited to resource-limited machines like microrobots, yet implementation artifacts, limited behaviors, and the frequent lack of formal guarantees blunt adoption. Here, we address these challenges with a new geometric approach called artificial spacetimes. We show that reactive robots navigating control fields obey the same dynamics as light rays in general relativity. This surprising connection allows us to adopt techniques from relativity and optics for constructing and analyzing control fields. When implemented, artificial spacetimes guide robots around structured environments, simultaneously avoiding boundaries and executing tasks like rallying or sorting, even when the field itself is static. We augment these capabilities with formal tools for analyzing what robots will do and provide experimental validation with silicon-based microrobots. Combined, this work provides a new framework for generating composed robot behaviors with minimal overhead.</p></details> |  |

However, current gaze-based assistive systems mainly help users with basic grasping actions, offering limited support. Moreover, the restricted intent recognition capability constrains the assistive system's ability to provide diverse assistance functions. In this paper, we propose an open implicit intention recognition framework powered by Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Foundation Model (VFM), which can process gaze input and recognize user intents that are not confined to predefined or specific scenarios. Furthermore, we implement a gaze-driven LLM-enhanced assistive robot system (MindEye-OmniAssist) that recognizes user's intentions through gaze and assists in completing task. To achieve this, the system utilizes open vocabulary object detector, intention recognition network and LLM to infer their full intentions. By integrating eye movement feedback and LLM, it generates action sequences to assist the user in completing tasks. Real-world experiments have been conducted for assistive tasks, and the system achieved an overall success rate of 41/55 across various undefined tasks. Preliminary results show that the proposed method holds the potential to provide a more user-friendly human-computer interaction interface and significantly enhance the versatility and effectiveness of assistive systems by supporting more complex and diverse task.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the application of vision transformer models, namely ViT (Vision Transformers) and BEiT (BERT Pre-Training of Image Transformers) pipelines, for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) in HRI. The focus is to generalize the SER models for individual speech characteristics by fine-tuning these models on benchmark datasets and exploiting ensemble methods. For this purpose, we collected audio data from different human subjects having pseudo-naturalistic conversations with the NAO robot. We then fine-tuned our ViT and BEiT-based models and tested these models on unseen speech samples from the participants. In the results, we show that fine-tuning vision transformers on benchmark datasets and and then using either these already fine-tuned models or ensembling ViT/BEiT models gets us the highest classification accuracies per individual when it comes to identifying four primary emotions from their speech: neutral, happy, sad, and angry, as compared to fine-tuning vanilla-ViTs or BEiTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

Although inferring additional information about the writers arm pose, kinematics, and dynamics based on digitizer data can be useful, it constitutes a challenge. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing a new set of features based on the dynamics of online signatures. These new features are inferred through a Lagrangian formulation, obtaining the sequences of generalized coordinates and torques for 2D and 3D robotic arm models. By combining kinematic and dynamic robotic features, our results demonstrate their significant effectiveness for online automatic signature verification and achieving state-of-the-art results when integrated into deep learning models.</p></details> |  |

Current methods require exact state measurements in order to enforce safety and liveness e.g. via control barrier functions (CBFs), which is challenging to achieve directly from onboard sensors like lidars and cameras. This work introduces LIVEPOINT, a decentralized control framework that synthesizes universal CBFs over point clouds to enable safe, deadlock-free real-time multi-robot navigation in dynamic, cluttered environments. Further, LIVEPOINT ensures minimally invasive deadlock avoidance behavior by dynamically adjusting agents' speeds based on a novel symmetric interaction metric. We validate our approach in simulation experiments across highly constrained multi-robot scenarios like doorways and intersections. Results demonstrate that LIVEPOINT achieves zero collisions or deadlocks and a 100% success rate in challenging settings compared to optimization-based baselines such as MPC and ORCA and neural methods such as MPNet, which fail in such environments. Despite prioritizing safety and liveness, LIVEPOINT is 35% smoother than baselines in the doorway environment, and maintains agility in constrained environments while still being safe and deadlock-free.</p></details> |  |

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data, such as GPT-4o, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across both text and images. But can they truly be used for this task in a zero-shot setting? And what are their limitations? In this paper, we explore these research questions via the free-form language-based robotic grasping task, and propose a novel method, FreeGrasp, leveraging the pre-trained VLMs' world knowledge to reason about human instructions and object spatial arrangements. Our method detects all objects as keypoints and uses these keypoints to annotate marks on images, aiming to facilitate GPT-4o's zero-shot spatial reasoning. This allows our method to determine whether a requested object is directly graspable or if other objects must be grasped and removed first. Since no existing dataset is specifically designed for this task, we introduce a synthetic dataset FreeGraspData by extending the MetaGraspNetV2 dataset with human-annotated instructions and ground-truth grasping sequences. We conduct extensive analyses with both FreeGraspData and real-world validation with a gripper-equipped robotic arm, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in grasp reasoning and execution.

This paper introduces a flexible tactile sensor based on Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), capable of simultaneously detecting and measuring contact forces and flexion of the sensor. The sensor integrates a magnetic hydrogel composite and utilizes EIT to reconstruct internal conductivity distributions. Real-time estimation is achieved through the one-step Gauss-Newton method, which dynamically updates reference voltages to accommodate sensor deformation. A convolutional neural network is employed to classify interactions, distinguishing between touch, bending, and idle states using pre-reconstructed images. Experimental results demonstrate an average touch localization error of 5.4 mm (SD 2.2 mm) and average bending angle estimation errors of 1.9$^\circ$ (SD 1.6$^\circ$). The proposed adaptive reference method effectively distinguishes between single- and multi-touch scenarios while compensating for deformation effects. This makes the sensor a promising solution for multimodal sensing in robotics and human-robot collaboration.</p></details> |  |

However, leveraging the ICL capabilities within LLMs to directly predict robot actions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RoboPrompt, a framework that enables off-the-shelf text-only LLMs to directly predict robot actions through ICL without training. Our approach first heuristically identifies keyframes that capture important moments from an episode. Next, we extract end-effector actions from these keyframes as well as the estimated initial object poses, and both are converted into textual descriptions. Finally, we construct a structured template to form ICL demonstrations from these textual descriptions and a task instruction. This enables an LLM to directly predict robot actions at test time. Through extensive experiments and analysis, RoboPrompt shows stronger performance over zero-shot and ICL baselines in simulated and real-world settings.

In practical situations of limited satellite signals or poor lighting conditions, navigation depends only on inertial sensors. In such cases, the navigation solution rapidly drifts due to inertial measurement errors. In this work, we propose WMINet a wheel-mounted inertial deep learning approach to estimate the mobile robot's position based only on its inertial sensors. To that end, we merge two common practical methods to reduce inertial drift: a wheel-mounted approach and driving the mobile robot in periodic trajectories. Additionally, we enforce a wheelbase constraint to further improve positioning performance. To evaluate our proposed approach we recorded using the Rosbot-XL a wheel-mounted initial dataset totaling 190 minutes, which is made publicly available. Our approach demonstrated a 66\% improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. As a consequence, our approach enables navigation in challenging environments and bridges the pure inertial gap. This enables seamless robot navigation using only inertial sensors for short periods.</p></details> |  |

While high-quality, diverse datasets enhance the performance and adaptability of robotic manipulation policies, collecting extensive expert-level data is resource-intensive. Consequently, many current datasets suffer from quality inconsistencies due to operator variability, highlighting the need for methods to utilize mixed-quality data effectively. To mitigate these issues, we propose "Select Segments to Imitate" (S2I), a framework that selects and optimizes mixed-quality demonstration data at the segment level, while ensuring plug-and-play compatibility with existing robotic manipulation policies. The framework has three components: demonstration segmentation dividing origin data into meaningful segments, segment selection using contrastive learning to find high-quality segments, and trajectory optimization to refine suboptimal segments for better policy learning. We evaluate S2I through comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments across six tasks, demonstrating that with only 3 expert demonstrations for reference, S2I can improve the performance of various downstream policies when trained with mixed-quality demonstrations.

To further facilitate this process, efforts have been made to combine it with Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) for more flexible and efficient policy transfer. However, these approaches are almost exclusively limited to offline demonstrations collected before policy transfer starts, which may suffer from the intrinsic issue of covariance shift brought by LfD and harm the performance of policy transfer. Meanwhile, extensive work in the learning-from-scratch setting has shown that online demonstrations can effectively alleviate covariance shift and lead to better policy performance with improved sample efficiency. This work combines these insights to introduce online demonstrations into a policy transfer setting. We present Policy Transfer with Online Demonstrations, an active LfD algorithm for policy transfer that can optimize the timing and content of queries for online episodic expert demonstrations under a limited demonstration budget. We evaluate our method in eight robotic scenarios, involving policy transfer across diverse environment characteristics, task objectives, and robotic embodiments, with the aim to transfer a trained policy from a source task to a related but different target task. The results show that our method significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of average success rate and sample efficiency, compared to two canonical LfD methods with offline demonstrations and one active LfD method with online demonstrations. Additionally, we conduct preliminary sim-to-real tests of the transferred policy on three transfer scenarios in the real-world environment, demonstrating the policy effectiveness on a real robot manipulator.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of physical world perception in this approach may lead to potential collisions during action optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel improvement on previous efforts by incorporating physical awareness of collisions through the learning of a neural robotic collision classifier. This enables the optimization of actions that avoid collisions with static, non-interactable environments as well as the robot itself. To facilitate effective gradient optimization with the classifier, we identify the underlying issue and propose leveraging Eikonal regularization to ensure consistent gradients for optimization. Our solution can be seamlessly integrated into existing differentiable robot rendering frameworks, utilizing gradients for optimization and providing a foundation for future applications of differentiable rendering in robotics with improved reliability of interactions with the physical world. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of our method compared to previous solutions.</p></details> |  |

Current imitation learning (IL) typically discards imperfect data, focusing solely on successful expert data. While reinforcement learning (RL) can learn from explorations and failures, the sim2real gap and its reliance on dense reward and online exploration make it difficult to apply effectively in real-world scenarios. In this work, we aim to conquer the challenge of leveraging imperfect data without the need for reward information to improve the model performance for robotic manipulation in an offline manner. Specifically, we introduce a Self-Supervised Data Filtering framework (SSDF) that combines expert and imperfect data to compute quality scores for failed trajectory segments. High-quality segments from the failed data are used to expand the training dataset. Then, the enhanced dataset can be used with any downstream policy learning method for robotic manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on the ManiSkill2 benchmark built on the high-fidelity Sapien simulator and real-world robotic manipulation tasks using the Franka robot arm demonstrated that the SSDF can accurately expand the training dataset with high-quality imperfect data and improve the success rates for all robotic manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

The proposed system enables continuous power delivery to the capsule without the need for onboard batteries, thus extending operational time and reducing size constraints. The WPT system operates through a resonant inductive coupling mechanism, based on a transmitting coil mounted on the end effector of a robotic arm that also houses an external permanent magnet and a localization coil for precise capsule manipulation. To ensure robust and stable power transmission in the presence of coil misalignment and rotation, a 3D receiving coil is integrated within the capsule. Additionally, a closed-loop adaptive control system, based on load-shift keying (LSK) modulation, dynamically adjusts the transmitted power to optimize efficiency while maintaining compliance with specific absorption rate (SAR) safety limits. The system has been extensively characterized in laboratory settings and validated through in vivo experiments using a porcine model, demonstrating reliable power transfer and effective robotic navigation in realistic gastrointestinal conditions: the average received power was 110 mW at a distance of 9 cm between the coils, with variable capsule rotation angles. The results confirm the feasibility of the proposed WPT approach for autonomous, battery-free robotic capsule endoscopy, paving the way for enhanced diagnostic in gastrointestinal medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, regular paper</p></details> |

However, their application to multi-person tracking (MPT) has lagged due to data scarcity and difficulties in individual identification. In this study, we propose a cooperative MPT system that utilizes co-located RGB and thermal cameras, using pseudo-annotations (bounding boxes + person IDs) to train RGB and T trackers. Evaluation experiments demonstrate that the T tracker achieves remarkable performance in both bright and dark scenes. Furthermore, results suggest that a tracker-switching approach using a binary brightness classifier is more suitable than a tracker-fusion approach for information integration. This study marks a crucial first step toward ``Dynamic-Dark SLAM," enabling effective recognition, understanding, and reconstruction of individuals, occluding objects, and traversable areas in dynamic environments, both bright and dark.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, technical report</p></details> |
| **[Focusing Robot Open-Ended Reinforcement Learning Through Users' Purposes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12579v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Ended Learning (OEL) autonomous robots can acquire new skills and knowledge through direct interaction with their environment, relying on mechanisms such as intrinsic motivations and self-generated goals to guide learning processes. OEL robots are highly relevant for applications as they can autonomously leverage acquired knowledge to perform tasks beneficial to human users in unstructured environments, addressing challenges unforeseen at design time. However, OEL robots face a significant limitation: their openness may lead them to waste time learning information that is irrelevant to tasks desired by specific users. Here, we propose a solution called `Purpose-Directed Open-Ended Learning' (POEL), based on the novel concept of `purpose' introduced in previous work. A purpose specifies what users want the robot to achieve. The key insight of this work is that purpose can focus OEL on learning self-generated classes of tasks that, while unknown during autonomous learning (as typical in OEL), involve objects relevant to the purpose. This concept is operationalised in a novel robot architecture capable of receiving a human purpose through speech-to-text, analysing the scene to identify objects, and using a Large Language Model to reason about which objects are purpose-relevant. These objects are then used to bias OEL exploration towards their spatial proximity and to self-generate rewards that favour interactions with them. The solution is tested in a simulated scenario where a camera-arm-gripper robot interacts freely with purpose-related and distractor objects. For the first time, the results demonstrate the potential advantages of purpose-focused OEL over state-of-the-art OEL methods, enabling robots to handle unstructured environments while steering their learning toward knowledge acquisition relevant to users.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, accepted at RLDM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Histogram Transporter: Learning Rotation-Equivariant Orientation Histograms for High-Precision Robotic Kitting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12541v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic kitting is a critical task in industrial automation that requires the precise arrangement of objects into kits to support downstream production processes. However, when handling complex kitting tasks that involve fine-grained orientation alignment, existing approaches often suffer from limited accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose Histogram Transporter, a novel kitting framework that learns high-precision pick-and-place actions from scratch using only a few demonstrations. First, our method extracts rotation-equivariant orientation histograms (EOHs) from visual observations using an efficient Fourier-based discretization strategy. These EOHs serve a dual purpose: improving picking efficiency by directly modeling action success probabilities over high-resolution orientations and enhancing placing accuracy by serving as local, discriminative feature descriptors for object-to-placement matching. Second, we introduce a subgroup alignment strategy in the place model that compresses the full spectrum of EOHs into a compact orientation representation, enabling efficient feature matching while preserving accuracy. Finally, we examine the proposed framework on the simulated Hand-Tool Kitting Dataset (HTKD), where it outperforms competitive baselines in both success rates and computational efficiency. Further experiments on five Raven-10 tasks exhibits the remarkable adaptability of our approach, with real-robot trials confirming its applicability for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is currently under review</p></details> |
| **[EmoBipedNav: Emotion-aware Social Navigation for Bipedal Robots with Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12538v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents an emotion-aware navigation framework -- EmoBipedNav -- using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for bipedal robots walking in socially interactive environments. The inherent locomotion constraints of bipedal robots challenge their safe maneuvering capabilities in dynamic environments. When combined with the intricacies of social environments, including pedestrian interactions and social cues, such as emotions, these challenges become even more pronounced. To address these coupled problems, we propose a two-stage pipeline that considers both bipedal locomotion constraints and complex social environments. Specifically, social navigation scenarios are represented using sequential LiDAR grid maps (LGMs), from which we extract latent features, including collision regions, emotion-related discomfort zones, social interactions, and the spatio-temporal dynamics of evolving environments. The extracted features are directly mapped to the actions of reduced-order models (ROMs) through a DRL architecture. Furthermore, the proposed framework incorporates full-order dynamics and locomotion constraints during training, effectively accounting for tracking errors and restrictions of the locomotion controller while planning the trajectory with ROMs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach exceeds both model-based planners and DRL-based baselines. The hardware videos and open-source code are available at https://gatech-lidar.github.io/emobipednav.github.io/.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Being-0: A Humanoid Robotic Agent with Vision-Language Models and Modular Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12533v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building autonomous robotic agents capable of achieving human-level performance in real-world embodied tasks is an ultimate goal in humanoid robot research. Recent advances have made significant progress in high-level cognition with Foundation Models (FMs) and low-level skill development for humanoid robots. However, directly combining these components often results in poor robustness and efficiency due to compounding errors in long-horizon tasks and the varied latency of different modules. We introduce Being-0, a hierarchical agent framework that integrates an FM with a modular skill library. The FM handles high-level cognitive tasks such as instruction understanding, task planning, and reasoning, while the skill library provides stable locomotion and dexterous manipulation for low-level control. To bridge the gap between these levels, we propose a novel Connector module, powered by a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). The Connector enhances the FM's embodied capabilities by translating language-based plans into actionable skill commands and dynamically coordinating locomotion and manipulation to improve task success. With all components, except the FM, deployable on low-cost onboard computation devices, Being-0 achieves efficient, real-time performance on a full-sized humanoid robot equipped with dexterous hands and active vision. Extensive experiments in large indoor environments demonstrate Being-0's effectiveness in solving complex, long-horizon tasks that require challenging navigation and manipulation subtasks.

The proposed models form a foundation for data-driven world models capable of simulating the biomechanical interactions and procedural dynamics of surgical suturing with high temporal fidelity. Annotating a dataset of $\sim2K$ clips extracted from simulation videos, we categorize surgical actions into fine-grained sub-stitch classes including ideal and non-ideal executions of needle positioning, targeting, driving, and withdrawal. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art video diffusion models, LTX-Video and HunyuanVideo, to generate high-fidelity surgical action sequences at $\ge$768x512 resolution and $\ge$49 frames. For training our models, we explore both Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and full-model fine-tuning approaches. Our experimental results demonstrate that these world models can effectively capture the dynamics of suturing, potentially enabling improved training simulators, surgical skill assessment tools, and autonomous surgical systems. The models also display the capability to differentiate between ideal and non-ideal technique execution, providing a foundation for building surgical training and evaluation systems. We release our models for testing and as a foundation for future research. Project Page: https://mkturkcan.github.io/suturingmodels/</p></details> |  |

Additionally, we present a new dexterous grasping dataset containing over 3.4 million diverse grasping poses for more than 15k different objects, demonstrating its potential to advance universal dexterous grasping.

However, they risk failing catastrophically when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) situations. Several approaches have employed a type of synaptic plasticity known as Hebbian learning that can dynamically adjust weights based on local neural activities. Research has shown that synaptic plasticity can make policies more robust and help them adapt to unforeseen changes in the environment. However, networks augmented with Hebbian learning can lead to weight divergence, resulting in network instability. Furthermore, such Hebbian networks have not yet been applied to solve legged locomotion in complex real robots with many degrees of freedom. In this work, we improve the Hebbian network with a weight normalization mechanism for preventing weight divergence, analyze the principal components of the Hebbian's weights, and perform a thorough evaluation of network performance in locomotion control for real 18-DOF dung beetle-like and 16-DOF gecko-like robots. We find that the Hebbian-based plastic network can execute zero-shot sim-to-real adaptation locomotion and generalize to unseen conditions, such as uneven terrain and morphological damage.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, advancements in LiDAR technology have made sensors more accurate, lightweight, and cost-effective. Therefore, researchers increasingly integrate sensors, for SLAM studies, providing robust technical support for ground robots and expanding their application domains. Public datasets are essential for advancing SLAM technology. However, existing datasets for ground robots are typically restricted to flat-terrain motion with 3 DOF and cover only a limited range of scenarios. Although handheld devices and UAV exhibit richer and more aggressive movements, their datasets are predominantly confined to small-scale environments due to endurance limitations. To fill these gap, we introduce M2UD, a multi-modal, multi-scenario, uneven-terrain SLAM dataset for ground robots. This dataset contains a diverse range of highly challenging environments, including cities, open fields, long corridors, and mixed scenarios. Additionally, it presents extreme weather conditions. The aggressive motion and degradation characteristics of this dataset not only pose challenges for testing and evaluating existing SLAM methods but also advance the development of more advanced SLAM algorithms. To benchmark SLAM algorithms, M2UD provides smoothed ground truth localization data obtained via RTK and introduces a novel localization evaluation metric that considers both accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we utilize a high-precision laser scanner to acquire ground truth maps of two representative scenes, facilitating the development and evaluation of mapping algorithms. We select 12 localization sequences and 2 mapping sequences to evaluate several classical SLAM algorithms, verifying usability of the dataset. To enhance usability, the dataset is accompanied by a suite of development kits.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |

This paper introduces Lan-o3dp, a language-guided object-centric diffusion policy framework that can adapt to unseen situations such as cluttered scenes, shifting camera views, and ambiguous similar objects while offering training-free collision avoidance and achieving a high success rate with few demonstrations. We train a diffusion model conditioned on 3D point clouds of task-relevant objects to predict the robot's end-effector trajectories, enabling it to complete the tasks. During inference, we incorporate cost optimization into denoising steps to guide the generated trajectory to be collision-free. We leverage open-set segmentation to obtain the 3D point clouds of related objects. We use a large language model to identify the target objects and possible obstacles by interpreting the user's natural language instructions. To effectively guide the conditional diffusion model using a time-independent cost function, we proposed a novel guided generation mechanism based on the estimated clean trajectories. In the simulation, we showed that diffusion policy based on the object-centric 3D representation achieves a much higher success rate (68.7%) compared to baselines with simple 2D (39.3%) and 3D scene (43.6%) representations across 21 challenging RLBench tasks with only 40 demonstrations. In real-world experiments, we extensively evaluated the generalization in various unseen situations and validated the effectiveness of the proposed zero-shot cost-guided collision avoidance.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

However, existing models primarily provide simple structured answers and struggle with complex scenarios due to their limited capability in recognizing long-range dependencies and aligning multimodal information. In this paper, we introduce Surgical-LVLM, a novel personalized large vision-language model tailored for complex surgical scenarios. Leveraging the pre-trained large vision-language model and specialized Visual Perception LoRA (VP-LoRA) blocks, our model excels in understanding complex visual-language tasks within surgical contexts. In addressing the visual grounding task, we propose the Token-Interaction (TIT) module, which strengthens the interaction between the grounding module and the language responses of the Large Visual Language Model (LVLM) after projecting them into the latent space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Surgical-LVLM on several benchmarks, including EndoVis-17-VQLA, EndoVis-18-VQLA, and a newly introduced EndoVis Conversations dataset, which sets new performance standards. Our work contributes to advancing the field of automated surgical mentorship by providing a context-aware solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is accepted by ICLR 2025 FM-Wild Workshop</p></details> |

This work addresses these challenges by introducing a novel method for pre-training with multi-modal human demonstrations. Our approach jointly learns inverse and forward dynamics to extract latent state representations, towards learning manipulation specific representations. This enables efficient fine-tuning with only a small number of robot demonstrations, significantly improving data efficiency. Furthermore, our method allows for the use of multi-modal data, such as combination of vision and touch for manipulation. By leveraging latent dynamics modeling and tactile sensing, this approach paves the way for scalable robot manipulation learning based on human demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, submission to RSS 2025</p></details> |

Traditional behavior cloning (BC) struggles to generalize beyond its training distribution, as it lacks an understanding of the safety critical reasoning behind expert demonstrations. To address this limitation, we propose GenOSIL, a novel imitation learning framework that explicitly incorporates environment parameters into policy learning via a structured latent representation. Unlike conventional methods that treat the environment as a black box, GenOSIL employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode measurable safety parameters such as obstacle position, velocity, and geometry into a latent space that captures intrinsic correlations between expert behavior and environmental constraints. This enables the policy to infer the rationale behind expert trajectories rather than merely replicating them. We validate our approach on two robotic platforms an autonomous ground vehicle and a Franka Emika Panda manipulator demonstrating superior safety and goal reaching performance compared to baseline methods. The simulation and hardware videos can be viewed on the project webpage: https://mumukshtayal.github.io/GenOSIL/.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

Our key insight is that high-quality trajectories can be discovered merely by denoising noisy trajectories sampled from a distribution. This approach has no learning component, relying instead on only two ingredients: a dynamical model of the robots to obtain feasible trajectories via rollout, and a score function to guide denoising with Monte Carlo gradient approximation. The proposed framework iteratively optimizes the deformation from the previous round with this denoising process, allows \textit{anytime} refinement as time permits, supports different dynamics, and benefits from GPU acceleration. Our evaluations for differential-drive and holonomic teams with up to 16 robots in 2D and 3D worlds show its ability to discover high-quality solutions faster than other black-box optimization methods such as MPPI, approximately three times faster in a 3D holonomic case with 16 robots. As evidence for feasibility, we demonstrate zero-shot deployment of the planned trajectories on eight multirotors.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates E2E robot navigation in unstructured road environments. First, we introduce two data collection pipelines - one for real-world robot data and another for synthetic data generated using the Isaac Sim simulator, which together produce an unstructured robotics navigation dataset -- FreeWorld Dataset. Second, we fine-tuned an efficient E2E autonomous driving model -- VAD -- using our datasets to validate the performance and adaptability of E2E autonomous driving models in these environments. Results demonstrate that fine-tuning through our datasets significantly enhances the navigation potential of E2E autonomous driving models in unstructured robotic environments. Thus, this paper presents the first dataset targeting E2E robot navigation tasks in unstructured scenarios, and provides a benchmark based on vision-based E2E autonomous driving algorithms to facilitate the development of E2E navigation technology for logistics and service robots.

However, achieving effective coordination in distributed multi-agent environments remains challenging due to (1) misalignment between instructions and task requirements and (2) inconsistency in robot behaviors when they independently interpret ambiguous instructions. To address these challenges, we propose Instruction-Conditioned Coordinator (ICCO), a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework designed to enhance coordination in language-guided multi-robot systems. ICCO consists of a Coordinator agent and multiple Local Agents, where the Coordinator generates Task-Aligned and Consistent Instructions (TACI) by integrating language instructions with environmental states, ensuring task alignment and behavioral consistency. The Coordinator and Local Agents are jointly trained to optimize a reward function that balances task efficiency and instruction following. A Consistency Enhancement Term is added to the learning objective to maximize mutual information between instructions and robot behaviors, further improving coordination. Simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of ICCO in achieving language-guided task-aligned multi-robot control. The demonstration can be found at https://yanoyoshiki.github.io/ICCO/.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

While recent Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have reduced the number of required demonstrations, they still rely on expert knowledge to collect high-quality data, limiting scalability and accessibility. We propose Sketch-to-Skill, a novel framework that leverages human-drawn 2D sketch trajectories to bootstrap and guide RL for robotic manipulation. Our approach extends beyond previous sketch-based methods, which were primarily focused on imitation learning or policy conditioning, limited to specific trained tasks. Sketch-to-Skill employs a Sketch-to-3D Trajectory Generator that translates 2D sketches into 3D trajectories, which are then used to autonomously collect initial demonstrations. We utilize these sketch-generated demonstrations in two ways: to pre-train an initial policy through behavior cloning and to refine this policy through RL with guided exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that Sketch-to-Skill achieves ~96% of the performance of the baseline model that leverages teleoperated demonstration data, while exceeding the performance of a pure reinforcement learning policy by ~170%, only from sketch inputs. This makes robotic manipulation learning more accessible and potentially broadens its applications across various domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Peiho...</summary><p>Peihong Yu and Amisha Bhaskar contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

However, this inherent heterogeneity presents significant challenges in teaming, necessitating efficient initial task allocation (ITA) strategies that optimally form complementary human-robot pairs or collaborative chains and establish well-matched task distributions. While current learning-based methods demonstrate promising performance, they often incur high computational costs and lack the flexibility to incorporate user preferences in multi-objective optimization (MOO) or adapt to last-minute changes in dynamic real-world environments. To address these limitations, we propose REBEL, an LLM-based ITA framework that integrates rule-based and experience-enhanced learning to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities and improve in-context adaptability to MOO and situational changes. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of REBEL in both single-objective and multi-objective scenarios, demonstrating superior alignment with user preferences and enhanced situational awareness to handle unexpected team composition changes. Additionally, we show that REBEL can complement pre-trained ITA policies, further boosting situational adaptability and overall team performance.

We present an online collision avoidance methodology leveraging 3D convex shape-based High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) to address this issue. While prior works focused on using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for human-robotic arm and single-arm collision avoidance, we explore the problem of collision avoidance between multiple robotic arms operating in a shared space. In our methodology, we utilize the proposed HOCBFs as centralized and decentralized safety filters. These safety filters are compatible with any nominal controller and ensure safety without significantly restricting the robots' workspace. A key challenge in implementing these filters is the computational overhead caused by the large number of safety constraints and the computation of a Hessian matrix per constraint. We address this challenge by employing numerical differentiation methods to approximate computationally intensive terms. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through extensive simulation studies and real-world experiments with Franka Research 3 robotic arms.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Adversarial Data Collection: Human-Collaborative Perturbations for Efficient and Robust Robotic Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11646v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of data efficiency, where quality outweighs quantity, has emerged as a cornerstone in robotic manipulation, especially given the high costs associated with real-world data collection. We propose that maximizing the informational density of individual demonstrations can dramatically reduce reliance on large-scale datasets while improving task performance. To this end, we introduce Adversarial Data Collection, a Human-in-the-Loop (HiL) framework that redefines robotic data acquisition through real-time, bidirectional human-environment interactions. Unlike conventional pipelines that passively record static demonstrations, ADC adopts a collaborative perturbation paradigm: during a single episode, an adversarial operator dynamically alters object states, environmental conditions, and linguistic commands, while the tele-operator adaptively adjusts actions to overcome these evolving challenges. This process compresses diverse failure-recovery behaviors, compositional task variations, and environmental perturbations into minimal demonstrations. Our experiments demonstrate that ADC-trained models achieve superior compositional generalization to unseen task instructions, enhanced robustness to perceptual perturbations, and emergent error recovery capabilities. Strikingly, models trained with merely 20% of the demonstration volume collected through ADC significantly outperform traditional approaches using full datasets. These advances bridge the gap between data-centric learning paradigms and practical robotic deployment, demonstrating that strategic data acquisition, not merely post-hoc processing, is critical for scalable, real-world robot learning. Additionally, we are curating a large-scale ADC-Robotics dataset comprising real-world manipulation tasks with adversarial perturbations. This benchmark will be open-sourced to facilitate advancements in robotic imitation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>More ...</summary><p>More information can be found on our project page:https://sites.google.com/view/adc-robot</p></details> |

Nonetheless, we show that object-centric methods can struggle to learn simple manipulation skills in multi-object environments. Thus, we propose DOCIR, an object-centric framework that introduces a disentangled representation for objects of interest, obstacles, and robot embodiment. We show that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance for learning pick and place skills from visual inputs in multi-object environments and generalizes at test time to changing objects of interest and distractors in the scene. Furthermore, we show its efficacy both in simulation and zero-shot transfer to the real world.</p></details> |  |

First, the robot's unique mechanical design, the dynamics model, and the basic control framework for terrestrial/aerial locomotion are briefly introduced. Second, a vectorable thrust control method derived from the basic control framework for aerial locomotion is presented. A key feature of this extended flight control is its ability to avoid interrotor aerodynamics interference under specific joint configuration. Third, another extended thrust control method and a fundamental gait strategy is proposed for special terrestrial locomotion called crawling that requires all legs to be lifted at the same time. Finally, the experimental results of the flight with a complex joint motion and the repeatable crawling motion are explained, which demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed thrust control methods for different locomotion modes.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 Pa...</summary><p>16 Pages.

| **[Multi-robot coordination for connectivity recovery after unpredictable environment changes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11520v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the present paper we develop a distributed method to reconnect a multi-robot team after connectivity failures, caused by unpredictable environment changes, i.e. appearance of new obstacles. After the changes, the team is divided into different groups of robots. The groups have a limited communication range and only a partial information in their field of view about the current scenario. Their objective is to form a chain from a static base station to a goal location. In the proposed distributed replanning approach, the robots predict new plans for the other groups from the new observed information by each robot in the changed scenario, to restore the connectivity with a base station and reach the initial joint objective. If a solution exists, the method achieves the reconnection of all the groups in a unique chain. The proposed method is compared with other two cases: 1) when all the agents have full information of the environment, and 2) when some robots must move to reach other waiting robots for reconnection. Numerical simulations are provided to evaluate the proposed approach in the presence of unpredictable scenario changes.</p></details> |  |

Traditional discrete systems struggle with rough terrain due to limited individual mobility, while modular systems--where rigid, controllable constraints link robot units--improve traversal but suffer from high control complexity and reduced flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-Robot System with Controllable Weak Constraints (MRS-CWC), where robot units are connected by constraints with dynamically adjustable stiffness. This adaptive mechanism softens or stiffens in real-time during environmental interactions, ensuring a balance between flexibility and mobility. We formulate the system's dynamics and control model and evaluate MRS-CWC against six baseline methods and an ablation variant in a benchmark dataset with 100 different simulation terrains. Results show that MRS-CWC achieves the highest navigation completion rate and ranks second in success rate, efficiency, and energy cost in the highly rugged terrain group, outperforming all baseline methods without relying on environmental modeling, path planning, or complex control. Even where MRS-CWC ranks second, its performance is only slightly behind a more complex ablation variant with environmental modeling and path planning. Finally, we develop a physical prototype and validate its feasibility in a constructed rugged environment.

| **[Optimal gait design for nonlinear soft robotic crawlers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17058v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robots offer a frontier in robotics with enormous potential for safe human-robot interaction and agility in uncertain environments. A stepping stone towards unlocking their potential is a control theory tailored to soft robotics, including a principled framework for gait design. We analyze the problem of optimal gait design for a soft crawling body - the crawler. The crawler is an elastic body with the control signal defined as actuation forces between segments of the body. We consider the simplest such crawler: a two-segmented body with a passive mechanical connection modeling the viscoelastic body dynamics and a symmetric control force modeling actuation between the two body segments. The model accounts for the nonlinear asymmetric friction with the ground, which together with the symmetric actuation forces enable the crawler's locomotion. Using a describing-function analysis, we show that when the body is forced sinusoidally, the optimal actuator contraction frequency corresponds to the body's natural frequency when operating with only passive dynamics. We then use the framework of Optimal Periodic Control (OPC) to design optimal force cycles of arbitrary waveform and the corresponding crawling gaits. We provide a hill-climbing algorithm to solve the OPC problem numerically. Our proposed methods and results inform the design of optimal forcing and gaits for more complex and multi-segmented crawling soft bodies.</p></details> |  |

Current datasets, such as Ego4D, often suffer from inconsistent view perspectives and misaligned interactions, leading to reduced video quality and limiting their applicability for precise imitation learning tasks. Towards this end, we introduce TASTE-Rob -- a pioneering large-scale dataset of 100,856 ego-centric hand-object interaction videos. Each video is meticulously aligned with language instructions and recorded from a consistent camera viewpoint to ensure interaction clarity. By fine-tuning a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) on TASTE-Rob, we achieve realistic object interactions, though we observed occasional inconsistencies in hand grasping postures. To enhance realism, we introduce a three-stage pose-refinement pipeline that improves hand posture accuracy in generated videos. Our curated dataset, coupled with the specialized pose-refinement framework, provides notable performance gains in generating high-quality, task-oriented hand-object interaction videos, resulting in achieving superior generalizable robotic manipulation. The TASTE-Rob dataset will be made publicly available upon publication to foster further advancements in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we present $\mathcal{D(R,O)}$ Grasp, a novel framework that models the interaction between the robotic hand in its grasping pose and the object, enabling broad generalization across various robot hands and object geometries. Our model takes the robot hand's description and object point cloud as inputs and efficiently predicts kinematically valid and stable grasps, demonstrating strong adaptability to diverse robot embodiments and object geometries. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulated and real-world environments validate the effectiveness of our approach, with significant improvements in success rate, grasp diversity, and inference speed across multiple robotic hands. Our method achieves an average success rate of 87.53% in simulation in less than one second, tested across three different dexterous robotic hands.

This paper introduces a novel flow-aware navigation and control strategy for magnetic micro-robots that explicitly accounts for the impact of fluid flow on their movement. First, the proposed method employs a Physics-Informed U-Net (PI-UNet) to refine the numerically predicted fluid velocity using local observations. Then, the predicted velocity is incorporated in a flow-aware A* path planning algorithm, ensuring efficient navigation while mitigating flow-induced disturbances. Finally, a control scheme is developed to compensate for the predicted fluid velocity, thereby optimizing the micro-robot's performance. A series of simulation studies and real-world experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach. This method enhances both planning accuracy and control precision, expanding the potential applications of magnetic micro-robots in fluid-affected environments typical of many medical scenarios.</p></details> | 8 |

With the emergence of foundation models, robots can now not only perceive geometric information but also achieve open-vocabulary scene understanding. However, existing map representations that support open-vocabulary queries often involve large data volumes, which becomes a bottleneck for multi-robot transmission in communication-limited environments. To address this challenge, we develop a method to construct a graph-structured 3D representation called COGraph, where nodes represent objects with semantic features and edges capture their spatial adjacency relationships. Before transmission, a data-driven feature encoder is applied to compress the feature dimensions of the COGraph. Upon receiving COGraphs from other robots, the semantic features of each node are recovered using a decoder. We also propose a feature-based approach for place recognition and translation estimation, enabling the merging of local COGraphs into a unified global map. We validate our framework on two realistic datasets and the real-world environment. The results demonstrate that, compared to existing baselines for open-vocabulary map construction, our framework reduces the data volume by over 80\% while maintaining mapping and query performance without compromise.

In particular, we exploit randomization of heading that the robot must follow to foster exploration of action-state transitions most useful for learning both forward locomotion as well as course adjustments. Changing the heading in episode resets to current yaw plus a random value drawn from a normal distribution yields policies able to follow complex trajectories involving frequent turns in both directions as well as long straight-line stretches. By repeatedly changing the heading, this method keeps the robot moving within the training platform and thus reduces human involvement and need for manual resets during the training. Real world experiments on a custom-built, low-cost quadruped demonstrate the efficacy of our method with the robot successfully navigating all validation tests. When trained with other approaches, the robot only succeeds in forward locomotion test and fails when turning is required.</p></details> | <details><summary>Austr...</summary><p>Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation (ACRA) 2022</p></details> |

However, enabling current vision-aware multimodal emotion recognition models for affective human-robot interaction in the real-world raises embodiment challenges: addressing the environmental noise issue and meeting real-time requirements. First, in multiparty conversation scenarios, the noises inherited in the visual observation of the robot, which may come from either 1) distracting objects in the scene or 2) inactive speakers appearing in the field of view of the robot, hinder the models from extracting emotional cues from vision inputs. Secondly, realtime response, a desired feature for an interactive system, is also challenging to achieve. To tackle both challenges, we introduce an affective human-robot interaction system called UGotMe designed specifically for multiparty conversations. Two denoising strategies are proposed and incorporated into the system to solve the first issue. Specifically, to filter out distracting objects in the scene, we propose extracting face images of the speakers from the raw images and introduce a customized active face extraction strategy to rule out inactive speakers. As for the second issue, we employ efficient data transmission from the robot to the local server to improve realtime response capability. We deploy UGotMe on a human robot named Ameca to validate its real-time inference capabilities in practical scenarios.

Traditional robotic source seeking methods typically focused on directing each robot to a specific strong source and may fall short in comprehensively identifying all potential sources. DIAS addresses this gap by introducing a hybrid controller that identifies the presence of sources and then alternates between exploration for data gathering and exploitation for guiding robots to identified sources. It further enhances search efficiency by dividing the environment into Voronoi cells and approximating source density functions based on Gaussian process regression. Additionally, DIAS can be integrated with existing source seeking algorithms. We compare DIAS with existing algorithms, including DoSS and GMES in simulated gas leakage scenarios where the number of sources outnumbers or is equal to the number of robots. The numerical results show that DIAS outperforms the baseline methods in both the efficiency of source identification by the robots and the accuracy of the estimated environmental density function.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) is commonly used with known maps but is computationally expensive due to landmark matching for each particle. Humanoid robots face additional challenges, including sensor noise from locomotion vibrations and a limited field of view (FOV) due to camera placement. This paper proposes a fast and robust localization method via iterative landmark matching (ILM) for humanoid robots. The iterative matching process improves the accuracy of the landmark association so that it does not need MCL to match landmarks to particles. Pose estimation with the outlier removal process enhances its robustness to measurement noise and faulty detections. Furthermore, an additional filter can be utilized to fuse inertial data from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and pose data from localization. We compared ILM with Iterative Closest Point (ICP), which shows that ILM method is more robust towards the error in the initial guess and easier to get a correct matching. We also compared ILM with the Augmented Monte Carlo Localization (aMCL), which shows that ILM method is much faster than aMCL and even more accurate. The proposed method's effectiveness is thoroughly evaluated through experiments and validated on the humanoid robot ARTEMIS during RoboCup 2024 adult-sized soccer competition.</p></details> |  |

The key feature of the system is the ability to overcome typical sensing and actuation discrepancies during sim-to-real transfer and to achieve consistent performance without any algorithmic modifications. To accomplish this, a lightweight noise-resistant visual perception system and a nonlinearity-robust servo system are adopted. We conduct a series of tests in both simulated and real-world environments. The visual perception system achieves the speed of 11 ms per frame due to its lightweight nature, and the servo system achieves sub-centimeter accuracy with the proposed controller. Both exhibit high consistency during sim-to-real transfer.

Hence, the current work presents a computational method developed to find optimal designs of continuum robots given reachability constraints. First, we leverage both forward and inverse kinematic computations to perform reachability analysis in an efficient yet accurate manner. While implementing inverse kinematics, we also integrate torque minimization at joints such that robot configurations with the minimum actuator torque required to reach a given workspace could be found. Lastly, we apply an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to find optimal robot dimensions while considering reachability, where the objective function could be the total length of the robot or the actuator torque required to operate the robot. Through three application problems, we show that the EDA is superior to a genetic algorithm (GA) in finding better solutions within a given number of iterations, as the objective values of the best solutions found by the EDA are 4-15\% lower than those found by the GA.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents SERN (Simulation-Enhanced Realistic Navigation), a novel framework integrating virtual and physical environments for real-time collaborative decision-making in multi-robot systems. SERN addresses key challenges in asset deployment and coordination through our bi-directional SERN ROS Bridge communication framework. Our approach advances the SOTA through: accurate real-world representation in virtual environments using Unity high-fidelity simulator; synchronization of physical and virtual robot movements; efficient ROS data distribution between remote locations; and integration of SOTA semantic segmentation for enhanced environmental perception. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-Metric Cost Function (MMCF) that dynamically balances latency, reliability, computational overhead, and bandwidth consumption to optimize system performance in contested environments. We further provide theoretical justification for synchronization accuracy by proving that the positional error between physical and virtual robots remains bounded under varying network conditions. Our evaluations show a 15% to 24% improvement in latency and up to a 15% increase in processing efficiency compared to traditional ROS setups. Real-world and virtual simulation experiments with multiple robots (Clearpath Jackal and Husky) demonstrate synchronization accuracy, achieving less than $5\text{ cm}$ positional error and under $2^\circ$ rotational error. These results highlight SERN's potential to enhance situational awareness and multi-agent coordination in diverse, contested environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review for IROS 2025</p></details> |

Many existing domain randomization approaches have been proposed to improve robustness and sim2real transfer. These approaches rely on wide randomization ranges to compensate for the unknown actual system parameters, leading to robust but inefficient real-world policies. In addition, the policies pretrained in the domain-randomized simulation are fixed after deployment due to the inherent instability of the optimization processes based on RL and the necessity of sampling exploitative but potentially unsafe actions on the real system. This limits the adaptability of the deployed policy to the inevitably changing system parameters or environment dynamics over time. We leverage safe RL and continual learning under domain-randomized simulation to address these limitations and enable safe deployment-time policy adaptation in real-world robot control. The experiments show that our method enables the policy to adapt and fit to the current domain distribution and environment dynamics of the real system while minimizing safety risks and avoiding issues like catastrophic forgetting of the general policy found in randomized simulation during the pretraining phase.

Specifically, linear data-driven models have struggled to control soft robots on complex, spatially extended paths that explore regions with significant nonlinear behavior. To account for these nonlinearities, we develop here a model-predictive control strategy based on the recent theory of adiabatic spectral submanifolds (aSSMs). This theory is applicable because the internal vibrations of heavily overdamped robots decay at a speed that is much faster than the desired speed of the robot along its intended path. In that case, low-dimensional attracting invariant manifolds (aSSMs) emanate from the path and carry the dominant dynamics of the robot. Aided by this recent theory, we devise an aSSM-based model-predictive control scheme purely from data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this data-driven model on various dynamic trajectory tracking tasks on a high-fidelity and high-dimensional finite-element model of a soft trunk robot. Notably, we find that four- or five-dimensional aSSM-reduced models outperform the tracking performance of other data-driven modeling methods by a factor up to 10 across all closed-loop control tasks.</p></details> | 33 pages, 19 figures |

Importantly, their passive compliance fundamentally alters contact mechanics by smoothing impacts and distributing forces over large areas. By integrating soft actuators, we can perform high-impact, dynamic, and contact-rich tasks that are challenging or impossible for traditional rigid robots. In order to explore the benefits of passive structural compliance and learn to utilize it effectively, we present a prototype robotic torso named Baloo. Baloo's hybrid soft-rigid design incorporates both adaptability from soft components and strength from rigid components with two meter-long, pneumatic robot arms mounted on a rigid torso. The hybrid design is capable of lifting end effector payloads of up to 19 kg, far exceeding many hybrid robot designs. Such payloads are competitive with similar-sized rigid robots, but with a much higher strength-to-weight ratio. Through 30 physical whole-body grasping experiments, we also demonstrate how a simple control strategy can generalize for effective lifting across six challenging objects with diverse shapes, sizes, and weights. A 100% success rate across all objects--achieved with the simple control strategy--underscores the potential of our hybrid soft-rigid robot design for contact-rich, whole-body tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Mechatronics for review</p></details> |

However, ensuring flexible and efficient cleaning of the human body poses challenges as it involves direct physical contact between the human and the robot, and necessitates simple, safe, and effective control. In this paper, we introduce a soft, expandable robotic manipulator with embedded capacitive proximity sensing arrays, designed for safe and efficient bathing assistance. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our soft manipulator, comparing it with a baseline rigid end effector in a human study involving 12 participants across $96$ bathing trails. Our soft manipulator achieves an an average cleaning effectiveness of 88.8% on arms and 81.4% on legs, far exceeding the performance of the baseline. Participant feedback further validates the manipulator's ability to maintain safety, comfort, and thorough cleaning.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches mainly learn a policy to predict a distant next-best end-effector pose (NBP) and then compute the corresponding joint rotation angles for motion using inverse kinematics. However, they suffer from two important issues: (1) rarely considering the physical robotic structure, which may cause self-collisions or interferences, and (2) overlooking the kinematics constraint, which may result in the predicted poses not conforming to the actual limitations of the robot joints. In this paper, we propose Kinematics enhanced Spatial-TemporAl gRaph Diffuser (KStar Diffuser). Specifically, (1) to incorporate the physical robot structure information into action prediction, KStar Diffuser maintains a dynamic spatial-temporal graph according to the physical bimanual joint motions at continuous timesteps. This dynamic graph serves as the robot-structure condition for denoising the actions; (2) to make the NBP learning objective consistent with kinematics, we introduce the differentiable kinematics to provide the reference for optimizing KStar Diffuser. This module regularizes the policy to predict more reliable and kinematics-aware next end-effector poses. Experimental results show that our method effectively leverages the physical structural information and generates kinematics-aware actions in both simulation and real-world</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing systems still face a persistent gap in simultaneously achieving four objectives: accurate tracking of full upper limb movements over extended durations (Accuracy), ergonomic adaptation to human biomechanics (Comfort), versatile data collection (e.g., force data) and compatibility with humanoid robots (Versatility), and lightweight design for outdoor daily use (Convenience). We present a wearable exoskeleton system, incorporating user-friendly immersive teleoperation and multi-modal sensing collection to bridge this gap. Due to the features of a novel shoulder mechanism with synchronized linkage and timing belt transmission, this system can adapt well to compound shoulder movements and replicate 100% coverage of natural upper limb motion ranges. Weighing 5.2 kg, NuExo supports backpack-type use and can be conveniently applied in daily outdoor scenarios.

| **[KUDA: Keypoints to Unify Dynamics Learning and Visual Prompting for Open-Vocabulary Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10546v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), significant progress has been made in developing open-vocabulary robotic manipulation systems. However, many existing approaches overlook the importance of object dynamics, limiting their applicability to more complex, dynamic tasks. In this work, we introduce KUDA, an open-vocabulary manipulation system that integrates dynamics learning and visual prompting through keypoints, leveraging both VLMs and learning-based neural dynamics models. Our key insight is that a keypoint-based target specification is simultaneously interpretable by VLMs and can be efficiently translated into cost functions for model-based planning. Given language instructions and visual observations, KUDA first assigns keypoints to the RGB image and queries the VLM to generate target specifications. These abstract keypoint-based representations are then converted into cost functions, which are optimized using a learned dynamics model to produce robotic trajectories. We evaluate KUDA on a range of manipulation tasks, including free-form language instructions across diverse object categories, multi-object interactions, and deformable or granular objects, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

| **[Confidence-Controlled Exploration: Efficient Sparse-Reward Policy Learning for Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06192v9)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for robotic navigation, allowing robots to learn through trial and error. However, real-world robotic tasks often suffer from sparse rewards, leading to inefficient exploration and suboptimal policies due to sample inefficiency of RL. In this work, we introduce Confidence-Controlled Exploration (CCE), a novel method that improves sample efficiency in RL-based robotic navigation without modifying the reward function. Unlike existing approaches, such as entropy regularization and reward shaping, which can introduce instability by altering rewards, CCE dynamically adjusts trajectory length based on policy entropy. Specifically, it shortens trajectories when uncertainty is high to enhance exploration and extends them when confidence is high to prioritize exploitation. CCE is a principled and practical solution inspired by a theoretical connection between policy entropy and gradient estimation. It integrates seamlessly with on-policy and off-policy RL methods and requires minimal modifications. We validate CCE across REINFORCE, PPO, and SAC in both simulated and real-world navigation tasks. CCE outperforms fixed-trajectory and entropy-regularized baselines, achieving an 18\% higher success rate, 20-38\% shorter paths, and 9.32\% lower elevation costs under a fixed training sample budget. Finally, we deploy CCE on a Clearpath Husky robot, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Versatile Demonstration Interface: Toward More Flexible Robot Demonstration Collection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19141v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous methods for Learning from Demonstration leverage several approaches for a human to teach motions to a robot, including teleoperation, kinesthetic teaching, and natural demonstrations. However, little previous work has explored more general interfaces that allow for multiple demonstration types. Given the varied preferences of human demonstrators and task characteristics, a flexible tool that enables multiple demonstration types could be crucial for broader robot skill training. In this work, we propose Versatile Demonstration Interface (VDI), an attachment for collaborative robots that simplifies the collection of three common types of demonstrations. Designed for flexible deployment in industrial settings, our tool requires no additional instrumentation of the environment. Our prototype interface captures human demonstrations through a combination of vision, force sensing, and state tracking (e.g., through the robot proprioception or AprilTag tracking). Through a user study where we deployed our prototype VDI at a local manufacturing innovation center with manufacturing experts, we demonstrated VDI in representative industrial tasks. Interactions from our study highlight the practical value of VDI's varied demonstration types, expose a range of industrial use cases for VDI, and provide insights for future tool design.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Maintaining Strong $r$-Robustness in Reconfigurable Multi-Robot Networks using Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14675v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In leader-follower consensus, strong $r$-robustness of the communication graph provides a sufficient condition for followers to achieve consensus in the presence of misbehaving agents. Previous studies have assumed that robots can form and/or switch between predetermined network topologies with known robustness properties. However, robots with distance-based communication models may not be able to achieve these topologies while moving through spatially constrained environments, such as narrow corridors, to complete their objectives. This paper introduces a Control Barrier Function (CBF) that ensures robots maintain strong $r$-robustness of their communication graph above a certain threshold without maintaining any fixed topologies. Our CBF directly addresses robustness, allowing robots to have flexible reconfigurable network structure while navigating to achieve their objectives. The efficacy of our method is tested through various simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and will appear at IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |

The controller uses proprioceptive sensor data to estimate external base wrench, that is used for precise control of the robot's acceleration during payload transport. The acceleration is controlled using a combination of admittance control and Control Barrier Function (CBF) based quadratic program (QP). The proposed controller rejects disturbances and maintains consistent performance under varying load conditions. Additionally, the built-in CBF guarantees collision avoidance with the collaborative agent in front of the robot. The efficacy of the overall controller is shown by its implementation on the physical hardware as well as numerical simulations. The proposed control framework aims to enhance the quadruped robot's ability to perform assistive tasks in various scenarios, from industrial applications to search and rescue operations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 20 figures |

The proposed filter is first tested with a benchmark numerical problem to validate the performance with other state-of-practice approaches such as Particle Gaussian Mixture (PGM) filters and Particle Filter (PF). Then the proposed approach is tested and compared against PF and PGM filters in real-world robotic field experiments to validate its impact for real-world robotic applications. The considered real-world scenarios have partial observability with the range-only measurement and uncertainty with the measurement model. The results show that the proposed filter can handle this partial observability effectively whilst showing improved performance compared to PF, reducing the computation requirements while demonstrating improved robustness over compared techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced View Planning for Robotic Harvesting: Tackling Occlusions with Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10334v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In agricultural automation, inherent occlusion presents a major challenge for robotic harvesting. We propose a novel imitation learning-based viewpoint planning approach to actively adjust camera viewpoint and capture unobstructed images of the target crop. Traditional viewpoint planners and existing learning-based methods, depend on manually designed evaluation metrics or reward functions, often struggle to generalize to complex, unseen scenarios. Our method employs the Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT) algorithm to learn effective camera motion policies from expert demonstrations. This enables continuous six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) viewpoint adjustments that are smoother, more precise and reveal occluded targets. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, featuring agricultural scenarios and a 6-DoF robot arm equipped with an RGB-D camera, demonstrate our method's superior success rate and efficiency, especially in complex occlusion conditions, as well as its ability to generalize across different crops without reprogramming. This study advances robotic harvesting by providing a practical "learn from demonstration" (LfD) solution to occlusion challenges, ultimately enhancing autonomous harvesting performance and productivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Generalized Adaptive Jacobian Controller for Soft Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04094v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The nonlinearity and hysteresis of soft robot motions have posed challenges in control. The Jacobian controller is transferred from rigid robot controllers and exhibits conciseness, but the improper assumption of soft robots induces the feasibility only in a small local area. Accurate controllers like neural networks can deal with delayed and nonlinear motion, achieving high accuracy, but they suffer from the high data amount requirement and black-box property. Inspired by these approaches, we propose an adaptive generalized Jacobian controller for soft robots. This controller is constructed by the concise format of the Jacobian controller but includes more states and independent matrices, which is suitable for soft robotics. In addition, the initialization leverages the motor babbling strategy and batch optimization from neural network controllers. In experiments, we first analyze the online controllers, including the Jacobian controller, the Gaussian process regression, and our controller. Real experiments have validated that our controller outperforms the RNN controller even with fewer data samples, and it is adaptive to various situations without fine-tuning, like different control frequencies, softness, and even manufacturing errors. Future work may include online adjustment of the controller format and adaptability validation in more scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[6D Object Pose Tracking in Internet Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10307v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek to extract a temporally consistent 6D pose trajectory of a manipulated object from an Internet instructional video. This is a challenging set-up for current 6D pose estimation methods due to uncontrolled capturing conditions, subtle but dynamic object motions, and the fact that the exact mesh of the manipulated object is not known. To address these challenges, we present the following contributions. First, we develop a new method that estimates the 6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object itself. The method proceeds by (i) retrieving a CAD model similar to the depicted object from a large-scale model database, (ii) 6D aligning the retrieved CAD model with the input image, and (iii) grounding the absolute scale of the object with respect to the scene. Second, we extract smooth 6D object trajectories from Internet videos by carefully tracking the detected objects across video frames. The extracted object trajectories are then retargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a robotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose estimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of instructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object trajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art RGB 6D pose estimation methods. Finally, we show that the 6D object motion estimated from Internet videos can be transferred to a 7-axis robotic manipulator both in a virtual simulator as well as in a real world set-up. We also successfully apply our method to egocentric videos taken from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset, demonstrating potential for Embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[ReVLA: Reverting Visual Domain Limitation of Robotic Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15250v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large language models and access to large-scale robotic datasets has sparked a paradigm shift in robotics models transforming them into generalists able to adapt to various tasks, scenes, and robot modalities. A large step for the community are open Vision Language Action models which showcase strong performance in a wide variety of tasks. In this work, we study the visual generalization capabilities of three existing robotic foundation models, and propose a corresponding evaluation framework. Our study shows that the existing models do not exhibit robustness to visual out-of-domain scenarios. This is potentially caused by limited variations in the training data and/or catastrophic forgetting, leading to domain limitations in the vision foundation models. We further explore OpenVLA, which uses two pre-trained vision foundation models and is, therefore, expected to generalize to out-of-domain experiments. However, we showcase catastrophic forgetting by DINO-v2 in OpenVLA through its failure to fulfill the task of depth regression. To overcome the aforementioned issue of visual catastrophic forgetting, we propose a gradual backbone reversal approach founded on model merging. This enables OpenVLA which requires the adaptation of the visual backbones during initial training -- to regain its visual generalization ability. Regaining this capability enables our ReVLA model to improve over OpenVLA by a factor of 77% and 66% for grasping and lifting in visual OOD tasks .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA-2025, Atlanta</p></details> |
| **[CODEI: Resource-Efficient Task-Driven Co-Design of Perception and Decision Making for Mobile Robots Applied to Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10296v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper discusses the integration challenges and strategies for designing mobile robots, by focusing on the task-driven, optimal selection of hardware and software to balance safety, efficiency, and minimal usage of resources such as costs, energy, computational requirements, and weight. We emphasize the interplay between perception and motion planning in decision-making by introducing the concept of occupancy queries to quantify the perception requirements for sampling-based motion planners. Sensor and algorithm performance are evaluated using False Negative Rates (FPR) and False Positive Rates (FPR) across various factors such as geometric relationships, object properties, sensor resolution, and environmental conditions. By integrating perception requirements with perception performance, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach is proposed for efficient sensor and algorithm selection and placement. This forms the basis for a co-design optimization that includes the robot body, motion planner, perception pipeline, and computing unit. We refer to this framework for solving the co-design problem of mobile robots as CODEI, short for Co-design of Embodied Intelligence. A case study on developing an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) for urban scenarios provides actionable information for designers, and shows that complex tasks escalate resource demands, with task performance affecting choices of the autonomy stack. The study demonstrates that resource prioritization influences sensor choice: cameras are preferred for cost-effective and lightweight designs, while lidar sensors are chosen for better energy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 33 images, IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[PhysVLM: Enabling Visual Language Models to Understand Robotic Physical Reachability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08481v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the environment and a robot's physical reachability is crucial for task execution. While state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) excel in environmental perception, they often generate inaccurate or impractical responses in embodied visual reasoning tasks due to a lack of understanding of robotic physical reachability. To address this issue, we propose a unified representation of physical reachability across diverse robots, i.e., Space-Physical Reachability Map (S-P Map), and PhysVLM, a vision-language model that integrates this reachability information into visual reasoning. Specifically, the S-P Map abstracts a robot's physical reachability into a generalized spatial representation, independent of specific robot configurations, allowing the model to focus on reachability features rather than robot-specific parameters. Subsequently, PhysVLM extends traditional VLM architectures by incorporating an additional feature encoder to process the S-P Map, enabling the model to reason about physical reachability without compromising its general vision-language capabilities. To train and evaluate PhysVLM, we constructed a large-scale multi-robot dataset, Phys100K, and a challenging benchmark, EQA-phys, which includes tasks for six different robots in both simulated and real-world environments. Experimental results demonstrate that PhysVLM outperforms existing models, achieving a 14\% improvement over GPT-4o on EQA-phys and surpassing advanced embodied VLMs such as RoboMamba and SpatialVLM on the RoboVQA-val and OpenEQA benchmarks. Additionally, the S-P Map shows strong compatibility with various VLMs, and its integration into GPT-4o-mini yields a 7.1\% performance improvement.</p></details> |  |
