| **[KAITIAN: A Unified Communication Framework for Enabling Efficient Collaboration Across Heterogeneous Accelerators in Embodied AI Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10183v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, such as autonomous robots and intelligent vehicles, are increasingly reliant on diverse heterogeneous accelerators (e.g., GPGPUs, NPUs, FPGAs) to meet stringent real-time processing and energy-efficiency demands. However, the proliferation of vendor-specific proprietary communication libraries creates significant interoperability barriers, hindering seamless collaboration between different accelerator types and leading to suboptimal resource utilization and performance bottlenecks in distributed AI workloads. This paper introduces KAITIAN, a novel distributed communication framework designed to bridge this gap. KAITIAN provides a unified abstraction layer that intelligently integrates vendor-optimized communication libraries for intra-group efficiency with general-purpose communication protocols for inter-group interoperability. Crucially, it incorporates a load-adaptive scheduling mechanism that dynamically balances computational tasks across heterogeneous devices based on their real-time performance characteristics. Implemented as an extension to PyTorch and rigorously evaluated on a testbed featuring NVIDIA GPUs and Cambricon MLUs, KAITIAN demonstrates significant improvements in resource utilization and scalability for distributed training tasks. Experimental results show that KAITIAN can accelerate training time by up to 42% compared to baseline homogeneous systems, while incurring minimal communication overhead (2.8--4.3%) and maintaining model accuracy. KAITIAN paves the way for more flexible and powerful heterogeneous computing in complex embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

| **[EmbodiedMAE: A Unified 3D Multi-Modal Representation for Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10105v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present EmbodiedMAE, a unified 3D multi-modal representation for robot manipulation. Current approaches suffer from significant domain gaps between training datasets and robot manipulation tasks, while also lacking model architectures that can effectively incorporate 3D information. To overcome these limitations, we enhance the DROID dataset with high-quality depth maps and point clouds, constructing DROID-3D as a valuable supplement for 3D embodied vision research. Then we develop EmbodiedMAE, a multi-modal masked autoencoder that simultaneously learns representations across RGB, depth, and point cloud modalities through stochastic masking and cross-modal fusion. Trained on DROID-3D, EmbodiedMAE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art vision foundation models (VFMs) in both training efficiency and final performance across 70 simulation tasks and 20 real-world robot manipulation tasks on two robot platforms. The model exhibits strong scaling behavior with size and promotes effective policy learning from 3D inputs. Experimental results establish EmbodiedMAE as a reliable unified 3D multi-modal VFM for embodied AI systems, particularly in precise tabletop manipulation settings where spatial perception is critical.</p></details> |  |
| **[EWMBench: Evaluating Scene, Motion, and Semantic Quality in Embodied World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09694v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in creative AI have enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images and videos conditioned on language instructions. Building on these developments, text-to-video diffusion models have evolved into embodied world models (EWMs) capable of generating physically plausible scenes from language commands, effectively bridging vision and action in embodied AI applications. This work addresses the critical challenge of evaluating EWMs beyond general perceptual metrics to ensure the generation of physically grounded and action-consistent behaviors. We propose the Embodied World Model Benchmark (EWMBench), a dedicated framework designed to evaluate EWMs based on three key aspects: visual scene consistency, motion correctness, and semantic alignment. Our approach leverages a meticulously curated dataset encompassing diverse scenes and motion patterns, alongside a comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation toolkit, to assess and compare candidate models. The proposed benchmark not only identifies the limitations of existing video generation models in meeting the unique requirements of embodied tasks but also provides valuable insights to guide future advancements in the field. The dataset and evaluation tools are publicly available at https://github.com/AgibotTech/EWMBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://github.com/AgibotTech/EWMBench</p></details> |
| **[ON as ALC: Active Loop Closing Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11523v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In simultaneous localization and mapping, active loop closing (ALC) is an active vision problem that aims to visually guide a robot to maximize the chances of revisiting previously visited points, thereby resetting the drift errors accumulated in the incrementally built map during travel. However, current mainstream navigation strategies that leverage such incomplete maps as workspace prior knowledge often fail in modern long-term autonomy long-distance travel scenarios where map accumulation errors become significant. To address these limitations of map-based navigation, this paper is the first to explore mapless navigation in the embodied AI field, in particular, to utilize object-goal navigation (commonly abbreviated as ON, ObjNav, or OGN) techniques that efficiently explore target objects without using such a prior map. Specifically, in this work, we start from an off-the-shelf mapless ON planner, extend it to utilize a prior map, and further show that the performance in long-distance ALC (LD-ALC) can be maximized by minimizing ``ALC loss" and ``ON loss". This study highlights a simple and effective approach, called ALC-ON (ALCON), to accelerate the progress of challenging long-distance ALC technology by leveraging the growing frontier-guided, data-driven, and LLM-guided ON technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version of a conference paper with 7 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Neural Brain: A Neuroscience-inspired Framework for Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07634v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has shifted from static, data-driven models to dynamic systems capable of perceiving and interacting with real-world environments. Despite advancements in pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning, current AI systems, such as large language models, remain disembodied, unable to physically engage with the world. This limitation has driven the rise of embodied AI, where autonomous agents, such as humanoid robots, must navigate and manipulate unstructured environments with human-like adaptability. At the core of this challenge lies the concept of Neural Brain, a central intelligence system designed to drive embodied agents with human-like adaptability. A Neural Brain must seamlessly integrate multimodal sensing and perception with cognitive capabilities. Achieving this also requires an adaptive memory system and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design, enabling real-time action in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a unified framework for the Neural Brain of embodied agents, addressing two fundamental challenges: (1) defining the core components of Neural Brain and (2) bridging the gap between static AI models and the dynamic adaptability required for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose a biologically inspired architecture that integrates multimodal active sensing, perception-cognition-action function, neuroplasticity-based memory storage and updating, and neuromorphic hardware/software optimization. Furthermore, we also review the latest research on embodied agents across these four aspects and analyze the gap between current AI systems and human intelligence. By synthesizing insights from neuroscience, we outline a roadmap towards the development of generalizable, autonomous agents capable of human-level intelligence in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 17 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Generative AI for Autonomous Driving: Frontiers and Opportunities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08854v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) constitutes a transformative technological wave that reconfigures industries through its unparalleled capabilities for content creation, reasoning, planning, and multimodal understanding. This revolutionary force offers the most promising path yet toward solving one of engineering's grandest challenges: achieving reliable, fully autonomous driving, particularly the pursuit of Level 5 autonomy. This survey delivers a comprehensive and critical synthesis of the emerging role of GenAI across the autonomous driving stack. We begin by distilling the principles and trade-offs of modern generative modeling, encompassing VAEs, GANs, Diffusion Models, and Large Language Models (LLMs). We then map their frontier applications in image, LiDAR, trajectory, occupancy, video generation as well as LLM-guided reasoning and decision making. We categorize practical applications, such as synthetic data workflows, end-to-end driving strategies, high-fidelity digital twin systems, smart transportation networks, and cross-domain transfer to embodied AI. We identify key obstacles and possibilities such as comprehensive generalization across rare cases, evaluation and safety checks, budget-limited implementation, regulatory compliance, ethical concerns, and environmental effects, while proposing research plans across theoretical assurances, trust metrics, transport integration, and socio-technical influence. By unifying these threads, the survey provides a forward-looking reference for researchers, engineers, and policymakers navigating the convergence of generative AI and advanced autonomous mobility.

This contribution introduces RAI - a framework for creating embodied Multi Agent Systems for robotics. The proposed framework implements tools for Agents' integration with robotic stacks, Large Language Models, and simulations. It provides out-of-the-box integration with state-of-the-art systems like ROS 2. It also comes with dedicated mechanisms for the embodiment of Agents. These mechanisms have been tested on a physical robot, Husarion ROSBot XL, which was coupled with its digital twin, for rapid prototyping. Furthermore, these mechanisms have been deployed in two simulations: (1) robot arm manipulator and (2) tractor controller. All of these deployments have been evaluated in terms of their control capabilities, effectiveness of embodiment, and perception ability. The proposed framework has been used successfully to build systems with multiple agents. It has demonstrated effectiveness in all the aforementioned tasks. It also enabled identifying and addressing the shortcomings of the generative models used for embodied AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, submitted to 23rd International Conference on Practical applications of Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (PAAMS'25)</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Collaborative Mechanisms Between Large and Small Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07460v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver powerful AI capabilities but face deployment challenges due to high resource costs and latency, whereas Small Language Models (SLMs) offer efficiency and deployability at the cost of reduced performance. Collaboration between LLMs and SLMs emerges as a crucial paradigm to synergistically balance these trade-offs, enabling advanced AI applications, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of LLM-SLM collaboration, detailing various interaction mechanisms (pipeline, routing, auxiliary, distillation, fusion), key enabling technologies, and diverse application scenarios driven by on-device needs like low latency, privacy, personalization, and offline operation. While highlighting the significant potential for creating more efficient, adaptable, and accessible AI, we also discuss persistent challenges including system overhead, inter-model consistency, robust task allocation, evaluation complexity, and security/privacy concerns. Future directions point towards more intelligent adaptive frameworks, deeper model fusion, and expansion into multimodal and embodied AI, positioning LLM-SLM collaboration as a key driver for the next generation of practical and ubiquitous artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPT-Bench: A Large-Scale, Long-Term and Robot-Egocentric Dataset for Benchmarking Target Person Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07446v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking a target person from robot-egocentric views is crucial for developing autonomous robots that provide continuous personalized assistance or collaboration in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Embodied AI. However, most existing target person tracking (TPT) benchmarks are limited to controlled laboratory environments with few distractions, clean backgrounds, and short-term occlusions. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoptic, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 35 sequences, both indoors and outdoors. Using this dataset and visual annotations, we perform extensive experiments with existing TPT methods, offering a thorough analysis of their limitations and suggesting future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. web: https://medlartea.github.io/tpt-bench/</p></details> |
| **[GeoNav: Empowering MLLMs with Explicit Geospatial Reasoning Abilities for Language-Goal Aerial Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09587v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-goal aerial navigation is a critical challenge in embodied AI, requiring UAVs to localize targets in complex environments such as urban blocks based on textual specification. Existing methods, often adapted from indoor navigation, struggle to scale due to limited field of view, semantic ambiguity among objects, and lack of structured spatial reasoning. In this work, we propose GeoNav, a geospatially aware multimodal agent to enable long-range navigation. GeoNav operates in three phases-landmark navigation, target search, and precise localization-mimicking human coarse-to-fine spatial strategies. To support such reasoning, it dynamically builds two different types of spatial memory. The first is a global but schematic cognitive map, which fuses prior textual geographic knowledge and embodied visual cues into a top-down, annotated form for fast navigation to the landmark region. The second is a local but delicate scene graph representing hierarchical spatial relationships between blocks, landmarks, and objects, which is used for definite target localization. On top of this structured representation, GeoNav employs a spatially aware, multimodal chain-of-thought prompting mechanism to enable multimodal large language models with efficient and interpretable decision-making across stages. On the CityNav urban navigation benchmark, GeoNav surpasses the current state-of-the-art by up to 12.53% in success rate and significantly improves navigation efficiency, even in hard-level tasks. Ablation studies highlight the importance of each module, showcasing how geospatial representations and coarse-to-fine reasoning enhance UAV navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Agentic AI Networking in 6G: A Generative Foundation Model-as-Agent Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15764v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The promising potential of AI and network convergence in improving networking performance and enabling new service capabilities has recently attracted significant interest. Existing network AI solutions, while powerful, are mainly built based on the close-loop and passive learning framework, resulting in major limitations in autonomous solution finding and dynamic environmental adaptation. Agentic AI has recently been introduced as a promising solution to address the above limitations and pave the way for true generally intelligent and beneficial AI systems. The key idea is to create a networking ecosystem to support a diverse range of autonomous and embodied AI agents in fulfilling their goals. In this paper, we focus on the novel challenges and requirements of agentic AI networking. We propose AgentNet, a novel framework for supporting interaction, collaborative learning, and knowledge transfer among AI agents. We introduce a general architectural framework of AgentNet and then propose a generative foundation model (GFM)-based implementation in which multiple GFM-as-agents have been created as an interactive knowledge-base to bootstrap the development of embodied AI agents according to different task requirements and environmental features. We consider two application scenarios, digital-twin-based industrial automation and metaverse-based infotainment system, to describe how to apply AgentNet for supporting efficient task-driven collaboration and interaction among AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |
| **[ACORN: Adaptive Contrastive Optimization for Safe and Robust Fine-Grained Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06628v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI research has traditionally emphasized performance metrics such as success rate and cumulative reward, overlooking critical robustness and safety considerations that emerge during real-world deployment. In actual environments, agents continuously encounter unpredicted situations and distribution shifts, causing seemingly reliable policies to experience catastrophic failures, particularly in manipulation tasks. To address this gap, we introduce four novel safety-centric metrics that quantify an agent's resilience to environmental perturbations. Building on these metrics, we present Adaptive Contrastive Optimization for Robust Manipulation (ACORN), a plug-and-play algorithm that enhances policy robustness without sacrificing performance. ACORN leverages contrastive learning to simultaneously align trajectories with expert demonstrations while diverging from potentially unsafe behaviors. Our approach efficiently generates informative negative samples through structured Gaussian noise injection, employing a double perturbation technique that maintains sample diversity while minimizing computational overhead. Comprehensive experiments across diverse manipulation environments validate ACORN's effectiveness, yielding improvements of up to 23% in safety metrics under disturbance compared to baseline methods. These findings underscore ACORN's significant potential for enabling reliable deployment of embodied agents in safety-critical real-world applications.</p></details> | 6 pages,4 figures |
| **[GRACE: Estimating Geometry-level 3D Human-Scene Contact from 2D Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06575v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the geometry level of human-scene contact aims to ground specific contact surface points at 3D human geometries, which provides a spatial prior and bridges the interaction between human and scene, supporting applications such as human behavior analysis, embodied AI, and AR/VR. To complete the task, existing approaches predominantly rely on parametric human models (e.g., SMPL), which establish correspondences between images and contact regions through fixed SMPL vertex sequences. This actually completes the mapping from image features to an ordered sequence. However, this approach lacks consideration of geometry, limiting its generalizability in distinct human geometries. In this paper, we introduce GRACE (Geometry-level Reasoning for 3D Human-scene Contact Estimation), a new paradigm for 3D human contact estimation. GRACE incorporates a point cloud encoder-decoder architecture along with a hierarchical feature extraction and fusion module, enabling the effective integration of 3D human geometric structures with 2D interaction semantics derived from images. Guided by visual cues, GRACE establishes an implicit mapping from geometric features to the vertex space of the 3D human mesh, thereby achieving accurate modeling of contact regions. This design ensures high prediction accuracy and endows the framework with strong generalization capability across diverse human geometries. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that GRACE achieves state-of-the-art performance in contact estimation, with additional results further validating its robust generalization to unstructured human point clouds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi-LSTM based Multi-Agent DRL with Computation-aware Pruning for Agent Twins Migration in Vehicular Embodied AI Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06378v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of large language models and embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the intelligent transportation scenarios, the combination of them in intelligent transportation spawns the Vehicular Embodied AI Network (VEANs). In VEANs, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are typical agents whose local advanced AI applications are defined as vehicular embodied AI agents, enabling capabilities such as environment perception and multi-agent collaboration. Due to computation latency and resource constraints, the local AI applications and services running on vehicular embodied AI agents need to be migrated, and subsequently referred to as vehicular embodied AI agent twins, which drive the advancement of vehicular embodied AI networks to offload intensive tasks to Roadside Units (RSUs), mitigating latency problems while maintaining service quality. Recognizing workload imbalance among RSUs in traditional approaches, we model AV-RSU interactions as a Stackelberg game to optimize bandwidth resource allocation for efficient migration. A Tiny Multi-Agent Bidirectional LSTM Proximal Policy Optimization (TMABLPPO) algorithm is designed to approximate the Stackelberg equilibrium through decentralized coordination. Furthermore, a personalized neural network pruning algorithm based on Path eXclusion (PX) dynamically adapts to heterogeneous AV computation capabilities by identifying task-critical parameters in trained models, reducing model complexity with less performance degradation. Experimental validation confirms the algorithm's effectiveness in balancing system load and minimizing delays, demonstrating significant improvements in vehicular embodied AI agent deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[CityNavAgent: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation with Hierarchical Semantic Planning and Global Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05622v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial vision-and-language navigation (VLN), requiring drones to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex urban environments, emerges as a critical embodied AI challenge that bridges human-robot interaction, 3D spatial reasoning, and real-world deployment. Although existing ground VLN agents achieved notable results in indoor and outdoor settings, they struggle in aerial VLN due to the absence of predefined navigation graphs and the exponentially expanding action space in long-horizon exploration. In this work, we propose \textbf{CityNavAgent}, a large language model (LLM)-empowered agent that significantly reduces the navigation complexity for urban aerial VLN. Specifically, we design a hierarchical semantic planning module (HSPM) that decomposes the long-horizon task into sub-goals with different semantic levels. The agent reaches the target progressively by achieving sub-goals with different capacities of the LLM. Additionally, a global memory module storing historical trajectories into a topological graph is developed to simplify navigation for visited targets. Extensive benchmark experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant improvement. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of different modules of CityNavAgent for aerial VLN in continuous city environments.

| **[3D Scene Generation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05474v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene generation seeks to synthesize spatially structured, semantically meaningful, and photorealistic environments for applications such as immersive media, robotics, autonomous driving, and embodied AI. Early methods based on procedural rules offered scalability but limited diversity. Recent advances in deep generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) and 3D representations (e.g., NeRF, 3D Gaussians) have enabled the learning of real-world scene distributions, improving fidelity, diversity, and view consistency. Recent advances like diffusion models bridge 3D scene synthesis and photorealism by reframing generation as image or video synthesis problems. This survey provides a systematic overview of state-of-the-art approaches, organizing them into four paradigms: procedural generation, neural 3D-based generation, image-based generation, and video-based generation. We analyze their technical foundations, trade-offs, and representative results, and review commonly used datasets, evaluation protocols, and downstream applications. We conclude by discussing key challenges in generation capacity, 3D representation, data and annotations, and evaluation, and outline promising directions including higher fidelity, physics-aware and interactive generation, and unified perception-generation models. This review organizes recent advances in 3D scene generation and highlights promising directions at the intersection of generative AI, 3D vision, and embodied intelligence.

| **[SITE: towards Spatial Intelligence Thorough Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05456v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence (SI) represents a cognitive ability encompassing the visualization, manipulation, and reasoning about spatial relationships, underpinning disciplines from neuroscience to robotics. We introduce SITE, a benchmark dataset towards SI Thorough Evaluation in a standardized format of multi-choice visual question-answering, designed to assess large vision-language models' spatial intelligence across diverse visual modalities (single-image, multi-image, and video) and SI factors (figural to environmental scales, spatial visualization and orientation, intrinsic and extrinsic, static and dynamic). Our approach to curating the benchmark combines a bottom-up survey about 31 existing datasets and a top-down strategy drawing upon three classification systems in cognitive science, which prompt us to design two novel types of tasks about view-taking and dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments reveal that leading models fall behind human experts especially in spatial orientation, a fundamental SI factor. Moreover, we demonstrate a positive correlation between a model's spatial reasoning proficiency and its performance on an embodied AI task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Embodied AI: Advances and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05108v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied artificial intelligence (Embodied AI) plays a pivotal role in the application of advanced technologies in the intelligent era, where AI systems are integrated with physical bodies that enable them to perceive, reason, and interact with their environments. Through the use of sensors for input and actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges presented by real-world applications. To fill this gap and foster further development in the field, this paper reviews the current state of research, analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions, providing insights to guide innovation and progress in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[RobotxR1: Enabling Embodied Robotic Intelligence on Large Language Models through Closed-Loop Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03238v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future robotic systems operating in real-world environments will require on-board embodied intelligence without continuous cloud connection, balancing capabilities with constraints on computational power and memory. This work presents an extension of the R1-zero approach, which enables the usage of low parameter-count Large Language Models (LLMs) in the robotic domain. The R1-Zero approach was originally developed to enable mathematical reasoning in LLMs using static datasets. We extend it to the robotics domain through integration in a closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. This extension enhances reasoning in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) settings without relying solely on distillation of large models through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We show that small-scale LLMs can achieve effective reasoning performance by learning through closed-loop interaction with their environment, which enables tasks that previously required significantly larger models. In an autonomous driving setting, a performance gain of 20.2%-points over the SFT-based baseline is observed with a Qwen2.5-1.5B model. Using the proposed training procedure, Qwen2.5-3B achieves a 63.3% control adaptability score, surpassing the 58.5% obtained by the much larger, cloud-bound GPT-4o. These results highlight that practical, on-board deployment of small LLMs is not only feasible but can outperform larger models if trained through environmental feedback, underscoring the importance of an interactive learning framework for robotic Embodied AI, one grounded in practical experience rather than static supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scenethesis: A Language and Vision Agentic Framework for 3D Scene Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02836v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing interactive 3D scenes from text is essential for gaming, virtual reality, and embodied AI. However, existing methods face several challenges. Learning-based approaches depend on small-scale indoor datasets, limiting the scene diversity and layout complexity. While large language models (LLMs) can leverage diverse text-domain knowledge, they struggle with spatial realism, often producing unnatural object placements that fail to respect common sense. Our key insight is that vision perception can bridge this gap by providing realistic spatial guidance that LLMs lack. To this end, we introduce Scenethesis, a training-free agentic framework that integrates LLM-based scene planning with vision-guided layout refinement. Given a text prompt, Scenethesis first employs an LLM to draft a coarse layout. A vision module then refines it by generating an image guidance and extracting scene structure to capture inter-object relations. Next, an optimization module iteratively enforces accurate pose alignment and physical plausibility, preventing artifacts like object penetration and instability. Finally, a judge module verifies spatial coherence. Comprehensive experiments show that Scenethesis generates diverse, realistic, and physically plausible 3D interactive scenes, making it valuable for virtual content creation, simulation environments, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaScenes: Towards Automated Replica Creation for Real-world 3D Scans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02388v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI (EAI) research requires high-quality, diverse 3D scenes to effectively support skill acquisition, sim-to-real transfer, and generalization. Achieving these quality standards, however, necessitates the precise replication of real-world object diversity. Existing datasets demonstrate that this process heavily relies on artist-driven designs, which demand substantial human effort and present significant scalability challenges. To scalably produce realistic and interactive 3D scenes, we first present MetaScenes, a large-scale, simulatable 3D scene dataset constructed from real-world scans, which includes 15366 objects spanning 831 fine-grained categories. Then, we introduce Scan2Sim, a robust multi-modal alignment model, which enables the automated, high-quality replacement of assets, thereby eliminating the reliance on artist-driven designs for scaling 3D scenes. We further propose two benchmarks to evaluate MetaScenes: a detailed scene synthesis task focused on small item layouts for robotic manipulation and a domain transfer task in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) to validate cross-domain transfer. Results confirm MetaScene's potential to enhance EAI by supporting more generalizable agent learning and sim-to-real applications, introducing new possibilities for EAI research.

A new field called Embodied Artificial Intelligence, which places at the intersection of Computer Vision, Robotics, and Decision Making, has been gaining importance during the last few years, as it aims to foster the development of smart autonomous robots and their deployment in society. The recent availability of large collections of 3D models for photorealistic robotic simulation has allowed faster and safe training of learning-based agents for millions of frames and a careful evaluation of their behavior before deploying the models on real robotic platforms. These intelligent agents are intended to perform a certain task in a possibly unknown environment. To this end, during the training in simulation, the agents learn to perform continuous interactions with the surroundings, such as gathering information from the environment, encoding and extracting useful cues for the task, and performing actions towards the final goal; where every action of the agent influences the interactions. This dissertation follows the complete creation process of embodied agents for indoor environments, from their concept to their implementation and deployment.

| **[Towards Efficient Online Tuning of VLM Agents via Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03792v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online fine-tuning vision-language model (VLM) agents with reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise for equipping agents with multi-step, goal-oriented capabilities in dynamic environments. However, their open-ended textual action space and non-end-to-end nature of action generation present significant challenges to effective online exploration in RL, e.g., explosion of the exploration space. We propose a novel online fine-tuning method, Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning (CoSo), better suited to the textual output space of VLM agents. Compared to prior methods that assign uniform uncertainty to all tokens, CoSo leverages counterfactual reasoning to dynamically assess the causal influence of individual tokens on post-processed actions. By prioritizing the exploration of action-critical tokens while reducing the impact of semantically redundant or low-impact tokens, CoSo enables a more targeted and efficient online rollout process. We provide theoretical analysis proving CoSo's convergence and policy improvement guarantees, and extensive empirical evaluations supporting CoSo's effectiveness. Our results across a diverse set of agent tasks, including Android device control, card gaming, and embodied AI, highlight its remarkable ability to enhance exploration efficiency and deliver consistent performance gains.

Therefore, sim-to-real transfer has emerged as a key approach, yet the sim-to-real gap persists. This survey examines how physics simulators address this gap by analyzing their properties overlooked in previous surveys. We also analyze their features for navigation and manipulation tasks, along with hardware requirements. Additionally, we offer a resource with benchmark datasets, metrics, simulation platforms, and cutting-edge methods-such as world models and geometric equivariance-to help researchers select suitable tools while accounting for hardware constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can We Trust Embodied Agents? Exploring Backdoor Attacks against Embodied LLM-based Decision-Making Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20774v3)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in real-world decision-making tasks for embodied artificial intelligence, especially when fine-tuned to leverage their inherent common sense and reasoning abilities while being tailored to specific applications. However, this fine-tuning process introduces considerable safety and security vulnerabilities, especially in safety-critical cyber-physical systems. In this work, we propose the first comprehensive framework for Backdoor Attacks against LLM-based Decision-making systems (BALD) in embodied AI, systematically exploring the attack surfaces and trigger mechanisms. Specifically, we propose three distinct attack mechanisms: word injection, scenario manipulation, and knowledge injection, targeting various components in the LLM-based decision-making pipeline. We perform extensive experiments on representative LLMs (GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, PaLM2) in autonomous driving and home robot tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and stealthiness of our backdoor triggers across various attack channels, with cases like vehicles accelerating toward obstacles and robots placing knives on beds. Our word and knowledge injection attacks achieve nearly 100% success rate across multiple models and datasets while requiring only limited access to the system. Our scenario manipulation attack yields success rates exceeding 65%, reaching up to 90%, and does not require any runtime system intrusion. We also assess the robustness of these attacks against defenses, revealing their resilience. Our findings highlight critical security vulnerabilities in embodied LLM systems and emphasize the urgent need for safeguarding these systems to mitigate potential risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper at ICLR 2025, 31 pages, including main paper, references, and appendix</p></details> |

In this paper, we define IGV as a technology that combines generative capabilities to produce diverse high-quality video content with interactive features that enable user engagement through control signals and responsive feedback. We survey the current landscape of IGV applications, focusing on three major domains: 1) gaming, where IGV enables infinite exploration in virtual worlds; 2) embodied AI, where IGV serves as a physics-aware environment synthesizer for training agents in multimodal interaction with dynamically evolving scenes; and 3) autonomous driving, where IGV provides closed-loop simulation capabilities for safety-critical testing and validation. To guide future development, we propose a comprehensive framework that decomposes an ideal IGV system into five essential modules: Generation, Control, Memory, Dynamics, and Intelligence. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the technical challenges and future directions in realizing each component for an ideal IGV system, such as achieving real-time generation, enabling open-domain control, maintaining long-term coherence, simulating accurate physics, and integrating causal reasoning. We believe that this systematic analysis will facilitate future research and development in the field of IGV, ultimately advancing the technology toward more sophisticated and practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the computational demands of virtual services and the inherent mobility of autonomous vehicles (AVs) necessitate real-time migration of Vehicular Embodied Agent AI Twins (VEAATs) between resource-constrained Roadside Units (RSUs). This paper proposes a novel framework for efficient VEAAT migration in VEANETs, combining a multi-leader multi-follower (MLMF) Stackelberg game-theoretic incentive mechanism with a tiny multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm. First, We propose an virtual immersive experience-driven utility model that captures AV-RSU dynamic interactions by integrating AVs' social influence, service complementarity and substitutability, and RSUs' resource allocation strategies to optimize VEAAT migration decisions. Second, to enhance training efficiency and enable efficient deployment on computation-constrained AVs while preserving exploration-exploitation performance, we propose TinyMA-IEI-PPO, a self-adaptive dynamic structured pruning algorithm that dynamically adjusts neuron importance based on agents' exploration incentives. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach achieves convergence comparable to baseline models and closely approximates the Stackelberg equilibrium.</p></details> |  |

This enables efficient streaming video processing while maintaining image representation capability.(ii) To train StreamFormer, we propose to unify diverse spatial-temporal video understanding tasks within a multitask visual-language alignment framework. Hence, StreamFormer learns global semantics, temporal dynamics, and fine-grained spatial relationships simultaneously.

| **[Personalized Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) via Neuroscience-Inspired Continuous Learning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20109v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence has made remarkable advancements in recent years, primarily driven by increasingly large deep learning models. However, achieving true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) demands fundamentally new architectures rather than merely scaling up existing models. Current approaches largely depend on expanding model parameters, which improves task-specific performance but falls short in enabling continuous, adaptable, and generalized learning. Achieving AGI capable of continuous learning and personalization on resource-constrained edge devices is an even bigger challenge. This paper reviews the state of continual learning and neuroscience-inspired AI, and proposes a novel architecture for Personalized AGI that integrates brain-like learning mechanisms for edge deployment. We review literature on continuous lifelong learning, catastrophic forgetting, and edge AI, and discuss key neuroscience principles of human learning, including Synaptic Pruning, Hebbian plasticity, Sparse Coding, and Dual Memory Systems, as inspirations for AI systems. Building on these insights, we outline an AI architecture that features complementary fast-and-slow learning modules, synaptic self-optimization, and memory-efficient model updates to support on-device lifelong adaptation. Conceptual diagrams of the proposed architecture and learning processes are provided. We address challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, memory efficiency, and system scalability, and present application scenarios for mobile AI assistants and embodied AI systems like humanoid robots. We conclude with key takeaways and future research directions toward truly continual, personalized AGI on the edge. While the architecture is theoretical, it synthesizes diverse findings and offers a roadmap for future implementation.</p></details> | 39 pages, 16 figures |

However, deploying these systems remains challenging due to prolonged runtime latency, limited scalability, and heightened sensitivity, leading to significant system inefficiencies. In this paper, we aim to understand the workload characteristics of embodied agent systems and explore optimization solutions. We systematically categorize these systems into four paradigms and conduct benchmarking studies to evaluate their task performance and system efficiency across various modules, agent scales, and embodied tasks. Our benchmarking studies uncover critical challenges, such as prolonged planning and communication latency, redundant agent interactions, complex low-level control mechanisms, memory inconsistencies, exploding prompt lengths, sensitivity to self-correction and execution, sharp declines in success rates, and reduced collaboration efficiency as agent numbers increase. Leveraging these profiling insights, we suggest system optimization strategies to improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of embodied agents across different paradigms. This paper presents the first system-level analysis of embodied AI agents, and explores opportunities for advancing future embodied system design.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Symposium on Performance Analysis of Systems and Software (ISPASS)</p></details> |

Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

Although recent advances in robotic hardware and embodied AI have expanded their capabilities, current systems still struggle with handling thin, flat, and deformable objects such as paper and fabric. This limitation arises from the lack of suitable perception techniques for robust state estimation under diverse object appearances, as well as the absence of planning techniques for generating appropriate grasp motions. To bridge these gaps, this paper introduces PP-Tac, a robotic system for picking up paper-like objects. PP-Tac features a multi-fingered robotic hand with high-resolution omnidirectional tactile sensors \sensorname. This hardware configuration enables real-time slip detection and online frictional force control that mitigates such slips. Furthermore, grasp motion generation is achieved through a trajectory synthesis pipeline, which first constructs a dataset of finger's pinching motions. Based on this dataset, a diffusion-based policy is trained to control the hand-arm robotic system. Experiments demonstrate that PP-Tac can effectively grasp paper-like objects of varying material, thickness, and stiffness, achieving an overall success rate of 87.5\%. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to grasp paper-like deformable objects using a tactile dexterous hand.

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods, which predominantly depend on sparse 3D point clouds, exhibit limited generalizability and robustness due to their sensitivity to coordinate variations and the inherent sparsity of the data. By contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers high-fidelity, real-time rendering with minimal computational overhead by representing scenes as dense, continuous distributions. This positions 3DGS as a highly effective approach for capturing fine-grained affordance details and improving recognition accuracy. Nevertheless, its full potential remains largely untapped due to the absence of large-scale, 3DGS-specific affordance datasets. To overcome these limitations, we present 3DAffordSplat, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset tailored for 3DGS-based affordance reasoning. This dataset includes 23,677 Gaussian instances, 8,354 point cloud instances, and 6,631 manually annotated affordance labels, encompassing 21 object categories and 18 affordance types. Building upon this dataset, we introduce AffordSplatNet, a novel model specifically designed for affordance reasoning using 3DGS representations. AffordSplatNet features an innovative cross-modal structure alignment module that exploits structural consistency priors to align 3D point cloud and 3DGS representations, resulting in enhanced affordance recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the 3DAffordSplat dataset significantly advances affordance learning within the 3DGS domain, while AffordSplatNet consistently outperforms existing methods across both seen and unseen settings, highlighting its robust generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first large-scale 3D Gaussians Affordance Reasoning Benchmark</p></details> |

In this work, we focus on the fine-grained behavior of fast-moving real robots and present a large-scale experimental study involving \numepisodes{} navigation episodes in a real environment with a physical robot, where we analyze the type of reasoning emerging from end-to-end training. In particular, we study the presence of realistic dynamics which the agent learned for open-loop forecasting, and their interplay with sensing. We analyze the way the agent uses latent memory to hold elements of the scene structure and information gathered during exploration. We probe the planning capabilities of the agent, and find in its memory evidence for somewhat precise plans over a limited horizon. Furthermore, we show in a post-hoc analysis that the value function learned by the agent relates to long-term planning. Put together, our experiments paint a new picture on how using tools from computer vision and sequential decision making have led to new capabilities in robotics and control.

Traditional defense strategies, such as input filtering and output monitoring, often introduce high computational overhead or interfere with task performance in real-time embodied scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose Concept Enhancement Engineering (CEE), a novel defense framework that leverages representation engineering to enhance the safety of embodied LLMs by dynamically steering their internal activations. CEE operates by (1) extracting multilingual safety patterns from model activations, (2) constructing control directions based on safety-aligned concept subspaces, and (3) applying subspace concept rotation to reinforce safe behavior during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that CEE effectively mitigates jailbreak attacks while maintaining task performance, outperforming existing defense methods in both robustness and efficiency. This work contributes a scalable and interpretable safety mechanism for embodied AI, bridging the gap between theoretical representation engineering and practical security applications. Our findings highlight the potential of latent-space interventions as a viable defense paradigm against emerging adversarial threats in physically grounded AI systems.</p></details> |  |

These models efficiently generate action policies by learning to predict noise. However, conventional Diffusion Policy methods rely on iterative denoising, leading to inefficient inference and slow response times, which hinder real-time robot control. To address these limitations, we propose a Classifier-Free Shortcut Diffusion Policy (CF-SDP) that integrates classifier-free guidance with shortcut-based acceleration, enabling efficient task-specific action generation while significantly improving inference speed. Furthermore, we extend diffusion modeling to the SO(3) manifold in shortcut model, defining the forward and reverse processes in its tangent space with an isotropic Gaussian distribution. This ensures stable and accurate rotational estimation, enhancing the effectiveness of diffusion-based control. Our approach achieves nearly 5x acceleration in diffusion inference compared to DDIM-based Diffusion Policy while maintaining task performance. Evaluations both on the RoboTwin simulation platform and real-world scenarios across various tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 Workshop on 2nd MEIS</p></details> |

However, multi-granularity interaction remains a challenging task due to the ambiguity of language and degraded quality when it comes to queries upon object components. In this work, we present FMLGS, an approach that supports part-level open-vocabulary query within 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We propose an efficient pipeline for building and querying consistent object- and part-level semantics based on Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). We designed a semantic deviation strategy to solve the problem of language ambiguity among object parts, which interpolates the semantic features of fine-grained targets for enriched information. Once trained, we can query both objects and their describable parts using natural language. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods prove that our method can not only better locate specified part-level targets, but also achieve first-place performance concerning both speed and accuracy, where FMLGS is 98 x faster than LERF, 4 x faster than LangSplat and 2.5 x faster than LEGaussians. Meanwhile, we further integrate FMLGS as a virtual agent that can interactively navigate through 3D scenes, locate targets, and respond to user demands through a chat interface, which demonstrates the potential of our work to be further expanded and applied in the future.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs primarily utilize static images or videos, limiting assessments to non-interactive scenarios. Meanwhile, existing embodied AI benchmarks are task-specific and not diverse enough, which do not adequately evaluate the embodied capabilities of MLLMs. To address this, we propose EmbodiedEval, a comprehensive and interactive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs with embodied tasks. EmbodiedEval features 328 distinct tasks within 125 varied 3D scenes, each of which is rigorously selected and annotated. It covers a broad spectrum of existing embodied AI tasks with significantly enhanced diversity, all within a unified simulation and evaluation framework tailored for MLLMs. The tasks are organized into five categories: navigation, object interaction, social interaction, attribute question answering, and spatial question answering to assess different capabilities of the agents. We evaluated the state-of-the-art MLLMs on EmbodiedEval and found that they have a significant shortfall compared to human level on embodied tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the limitations of existing MLLMs in embodied capabilities, providing insights for their future development.

While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce MrSteve (Memory Recall Steve), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods.

Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

When humans grasp an object, appropriate trajectories naturally form in our minds to use it for specific tasks. Hand-object interaction trajectory priors can greatly benefit applications in robotics, embodied AI, augmented reality and related fields. However, synthesizing realistic and appropriate hand trajectories given a single object or hand-object interaction image is a highly ambiguous task, requiring to correctly identify the object of interest and possibly even the correct interaction among many possible alternatives. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose the SIGHT-Fusion system, consisting of a curated pipeline for extracting visual features of hand-object interaction details from egocentric videos involving object manipulation, and a diffusion-based conditional motion generation model processing the extracted features. We train our method given video data with corresponding hand trajectory annotations, without supervision in the form of action labels. For the evaluation, we establish benchmarks utilizing the first-person FPHAB and HOI4D datasets, testing our method against various baselines and using multiple metrics. We also introduce task simulators for executing the generated hand trajectories and reporting task success rates as an additional metric. Experiments show that our method generates more appropriate and realistic hand trajectories than baselines and presents promising generalization capability on unseen objects. The accuracy of the generated hand trajectories is confirmed in a physics simulation setting, showcasing the authenticity of the created sequences and their applicability in downstream uses.</p></details> |  |

We develop a method based on next-best-view exploration, where potential poses are scored based on the semantic features visible from that pose. We explore two alternative methods for sampling potential views and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in both simulation and physical experiments.

Although Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)-based methods perform well in offline RL, their high computational and energy demands motivate exploration of more efficient alternatives. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) show promise for such tasks, given their low power consumption. In this work, we introduce DSFormer, the first spike-driven transformer model designed to tackle offline RL via sequence modeling. Unlike existing SNN transformers focused on spatial dimensions for vision tasks, we develop Temporal Spiking Self-Attention (TSSA) and Positional Spiking Self-Attention (PSSA) in DSFormer to capture the temporal and positional dependencies essential for sequence modeling in RL. Additionally, we propose Progressive Threshold-dependent Batch Normalization (PTBN), which combines the benefits of LayerNorm and BatchNorm to preserve temporal dependencies while maintaining the spiking nature of SNNs. Comprehensive results in the D4RL benchmark show DSFormer's superiority over both SNN and ANN counterparts, achieving 78.4% energy savings, highlighting DSFormer's advantages not only in energy efficiency but also in competitive performance.

Existing representations, such as object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover, these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that 3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in 3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

Using the BridgeData V2 dataset, we generate fine-tuned image captions with a pretrained BLIP-2 vision-language model and combine them with visual features through an early fusion strategy. The fused representations are processed using Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agents. Experimental results demonstrate that multimodal agents achieve a 20% improvement in task completion rates and significantly outperform visual-only and textual-only baselines after sufficient training. Compared to transformer-based and recurrent multimodal RL models, our approach achieves superior performance in cumulative reward and caption quality metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L). These results highlight the impact of semantically aligned language cues in enhancing agent learning efficiency and generalization.

| **[TokenHSI: Unified Synthesis of Physical Human-Scene Interactions through Task Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19901v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing diverse and physically plausible Human-Scene Interactions (HSI) is pivotal for both computer animation and embodied AI. Despite encouraging progress, current methods mainly focus on developing separate controllers, each specialized for a specific interaction task. This significantly hinders the ability to tackle a wide variety of challenging HSI tasks that require the integration of multiple skills, e.g., sitting down while carrying an object. To address this issue, we present TokenHSI, a single, unified transformer-based policy capable of multi-skill unification and flexible adaptation. The key insight is to model the humanoid proprioception as a separate shared token and combine it with distinct task tokens via a masking mechanism. Such a unified policy enables effective knowledge sharing across skills, thereby facilitating the multi-task training. Moreover, our policy architecture supports variable length inputs, enabling flexible adaptation of learned skills to new scenarios. By training additional task tokenizers, we can not only modify the geometries of interaction targets but also coordinate multiple skills to address complex tasks. The experiments demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve versatility, adaptability, and extensibility in various HSI tasks.

However, current multimodal retrieval tasks lack sufficient complexity and demonstrate limited practical application value. It spires us to design Instance-Driven Multimodal Image Retrieval (IDMR), a novel task that requires models to retrieve images containing the same instance as a query image while matching a text-described scenario. Unlike existing retrieval tasks focused on global image similarity or category-level matching, IDMR demands fine-grained instance-level consistency across diverse contexts. To benchmark this capability, we develop IDMR-bench using real-world object tracking and first-person video data. Addressing the scarcity of training data, we propose a cross-domain synthesis method that creates 557K training samples by cropping objects from standard detection datasets. Our Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based retrieval model, trained on 1.2M samples, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both traditional benchmarks and our zero-shot IDMR-bench. Experimental results demonstrate previous models' limitations in instance-aware retrieval and highlight the potential of MLLM for advanced retrieval applications. The whole training dataset, codes and models, with wide ranges of sizes, are available at https://github.com/BwLiu01/IDMR.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a novel framework that bridges embodied cognition theory and agent systems by leveraging a formal characterization of image schemas, which are defined as recurring patterns of sensorimotor experience that structure human cognition. By customizing LLMs to translate natural language descriptions into formal representations based on these sensorimotor patterns, we will be able to create a neurosymbolic system that grounds the agent's understanding in fundamental conceptual structures. We argue that such an approach enhances both efficiency and interpretability while enabling more intuitive human-agent interactions through shared embodied understanding.</p></details> |  |

Data-driven embodied AI algorithms demand precise, large-scale, human-like manipulation sequences, which are challenging to obtain with conventional reinforcement learning or real-world teleoperation. To address this, we introduce ManipTrans, a novel two-stage method for efficiently transferring human bimanual skills to dexterous robotic hands in simulation. ManipTrans first pre-trains a generalist trajectory imitator to mimic hand motion, then fine-tunes a specific residual module under interaction constraints, enabling efficient learning and accurate execution of complex bimanual tasks. Experiments show that ManipTrans surpasses state-of-the-art methods in success rate, fidelity, and efficiency. Leveraging ManipTrans, we transfer multiple hand-object datasets to robotic hands, creating DexManipNet, a large-scale dataset featuring previously unexplored tasks like pen capping and bottle unscrewing. DexManipNet comprises 3.3K episodes of robotic manipulation and is easily extensible, facilitating further policy training for dexterous hands and enabling real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Graphs as World Models for Semantic Material-Aware Obstacle Handling in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21232v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) to infer the material properties of obstacles limits their decision-making capacity. While AVs rely on sensor systems such as cameras, LiDAR, and radar to detect obstacles, this study suggests combining sensors with a knowledge graph (KG)-based world model to improve AVs' comprehension of physical material qualities. Beyond sensor data, AVs can infer qualities such as malleability, density, and elasticity using a semantic KG that depicts the relationships between obstacles and their attributes. Using the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, we evaluated AV performance with and without KG integration. The findings demonstrate that the KG-based method improves obstacle management, which allows AVs to use material qualities to make better decisions about when to change lanes or apply emergency braking. For example, the KG-integrated AV changed lanes for hard impediments like traffic cones and successfully avoided collisions with flexible items such as plastic bags by passing over them. Compared to the control system, the KG framework demonstrated improved responsiveness to obstacles by resolving conflicting sensor data, causing emergency stops for 13.3% more cases. In addition, our method exhibits a 6.6% higher success rate in lane-changing maneuvers in experimental scenarios, particularly for larger, high-impact obstacles. While we focus particularly on autonomous driving, our work demonstrates the potential of KG-based world models to improve decision-making in embodied AI systems and scale to other domains, including robotics, healthcare, and environmental simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Reasoning Video Segmentation with Just-in-Time Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21056v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning segmentation (RS) aims to identify and segment objects of interest based on implicit text queries. As such, RS is a catalyst for embodied AI agents, enabling them to interpret high-level commands without requiring explicit step-by-step guidance. However, current RS approaches rely heavily on the visual perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs), leading to several major limitations. First, they struggle with queries that require multiple steps of reasoning or those that involve complex spatial/temporal relationships. Second, they necessitate LLM fine-tuning, which may require frequent updates to maintain compatibility with contemporary LLMs and may increase risks of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Finally, being primarily designed for static images or offline video processing, they scale poorly to online video data. To address these limitations, we propose an agent framework that disentangles perception and reasoning for online video RS without LLM fine-tuning. Our innovation is the introduction of a just-in-time digital twin concept, where -- given an implicit query -- a LLM plans the construction of a low-level scene representation from high-level video using specialist vision models. We refer to this approach to creating a digital twin as "just-in-time" because the LLM planner will anticipate the need for specific information and only request this limited subset instead of always evaluating every specialist model. The LLM then performs reasoning on this digital twin representation to identify target objects. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new comprehensive video reasoning segmentation benchmark comprising 200 videos with 895 implicit text queries. The benchmark spans three reasoning categories (semantic, spatial, and temporal) with three different reasoning chain complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[DINeMo: Learning Neural Mesh Models with no 3D Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20220v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Category-level 3D/6D pose estimation is a crucial step towards comprehensive 3D scene understanding, which would enable a broad range of applications in robotics and embodied AI. Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations.

| **[DataPlatter: Boosting Robotic Manipulation Generalization with Minimal Costly Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19516v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied AI intensifies the demand for diverse manipulation demonstrations. However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the DataPlatter method, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.</p></details> |  |

Following this trend, research integrating robots with AGI has become prominent. As various kinds of embodiments have been designed, adaptability to diverse embodiments will become important to AGI. We introduce a new challenge, termed "Body Discovery of Embodied AI", focusing on tasks of recognizing embodiments and summarizing neural signal functionality. The challenge encompasses the precise definition of an AI body and the intricate task of identifying embodiments in dynamic environments, where conventional approaches often prove inadequate. To address these challenges, we apply causal inference method and evaluate it by developing a simulator tailored for testing algorithms with virtual environments. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our algorithms through empirical testing, demonstrating their robust performance in various scenarios based on virtual environments.</p></details> |  |

In the context of AI-Generated Content (AIGC), RAG has proven invaluable by augmenting model outputs with supplementary, relevant information, thus improving their quality. Recently, the potential of RAG has extended beyond natural language processing, with emerging methods integrating retrieval-augmented strategies into the computer vision (CV) domain. These approaches aim to address the limitations of relying solely on internal model knowledge by incorporating authoritative external knowledge bases, thereby improving both the understanding and generation capabilities of vision models. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the current state of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV, focusing on two main areas: (I) visual understanding and (II) visual generation. In the realm of visual understanding, we systematically review tasks ranging from basic image recognition to complex applications such as medical report generation and multimodal question answering. For visual content generation, we examine the application of RAG in tasks related to image, video, and 3D generation. Furthermore, we explore recent advancements in RAG for embodied AI, with a particular focus on applications in planning, task execution, multimodal perception, interaction, and specialized domains. Given that the integration of retrieval-augmented techniques in CV is still in its early stages, we also highlight the key limitations of current approaches and propose future research directions to drive the development of this promising area.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |

Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper introduces a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with ~7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications.

However, most existing work shares two typical constraints: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intension and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects only which leads to over-simplified textual descriptions due to the negligence of multi-object scenarios and spatial relations among objects. We bridge the research gaps by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and tailored 3D scene understanding designs. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes, and the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation.

Yet, existing methods cannot synthesize interactions in unseen environments such as in-the-wild scenes or reconstructed scenes, as they rely on paired 3D scenes and captured human motion data for training, which are unavailable for unseen environments. We present ZeroHSI, a novel approach that enables zero-shot 4D human-scene interaction synthesis, eliminating the need for training on any MoCap data. Our key insight is to distill human-scene interactions from state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data. We evaluate ZeroHSI on a curated dataset of different types of various indoor and outdoor scenes with different interaction prompts, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse and contextually appropriate human-scene interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://awfuact.github.io/zerohsi/ The first two authors contribute equally</p></details> |

Traditional weak augmentations, such as cropping and flipping, are insufficient for improving a model's performance in new environments. Existing data augmentation methods often disrupt task-relevant information in images, potentially degrading performance. To overcome these challenges, we introduce EAGLE, an efficient training framework for generalizable visuomotor policies that improves upon existing methods by (1) enhancing generalization by applying augmentation only to control-related regions identified through a self-supervised control-aware mask and (2) improving training stability and efficiency by distilling knowledge from an expert to a visuomotor student policy, which is then deployed to unseen environments without further fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on three domains, including the DMControl Generalization Benchmark, the enhanced Robot Manipulation Distraction Benchmark, and a long-sequential drawer-opening task, validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we introduce KARMA, an innovative memory system that integrates long-term and short-term memory modules, enhancing large language models (LLMs) for planning in embodied agents through memory-augmented prompting. KARMA distinguishes between long-term and short-term memory, with long-term memory capturing comprehensive 3D scene graphs as representations of the environment, while short-term memory dynamically records changes in objects' positions and states. This dual-memory structure allows agents to retrieve relevant past scene experiences, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of task planning. Short-term memory employs strategies for effective and adaptive memory replacement, ensuring the retention of critical information while discarding less pertinent data. Compared to state-of-the-art embodied agents enhanced with memory, our memory-augmented embodied AI agent improves success rates by 1.3x and 2.3x in Composite Tasks and Complex Tasks within the AI2-THOR simulator, respectively, and enhances task execution efficiency by 3.4x and 62.7x. Furthermore, we demonstrate that KARMA's plug-and-play capability allows for seamless deployment on real-world robotic systems, such as mobile manipulation platforms.Through this plug-and-play memory system, KARMA significantly enhances the ability of embodied agents to generate coherent and contextually appropriate plans, making the execution of complex household tasks more efficient.

While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive language understanding and generation capabilities, their adaptation to 3D environments (3D-LLMs) remains in its early stages. A primary challenge is a lack of large-scale datasets with dense grounding between language and 3D scenes. We introduce 3D-GRAND, a pioneering large-scale dataset comprising 40,087 household scenes paired with 6.2 million densely-grounded scene-language instructions. Our results show that instruction tuning with 3D-GRAND significantly enhances grounding capabilities and reduces hallucinations in 3D-LLMs. As part of our contributions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark 3D-POPE to systematically evaluate hallucination in 3D-LLMs, enabling fair comparisons of models. Our experiments highlight a scaling effect between dataset size and 3D-LLM performance, emphasizing the importance of large-scale 3D-text datasets for embodied AI research. Our results demonstrate early signals for effective sim-to-real transfer, indicating that models trained on large synthetic data can perform well on real-world 3D scans.

However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MoK-RAG, a novel multi-source RAG framework that implements a mixture of knowledge paths enhanced retrieval mechanism through functional partitioning of a large language model (LLM) corpus into distinct sections, enabling retrieval from multiple specialized knowledge paths. Applied to the generation of 3D simulated environments, our proposed MoK-RAG3D enhances this paradigm by partitioning 3D assets into distinct sections and organizing them based on a hierarchical knowledge tree structure. Different from previous methods that only use manual evaluation, we pioneered the introduction of automated evaluation methods for 3D scenes. Both automatic and human evaluations in our experiments demonstrate that MoK-RAG3D can assist Embodied AI agents in generating diverse scenes.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing works share two constraints: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. To bridge the gaps, we propose 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations.

Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the static to openable (S2O) task which creates interactive articulated 3D objects from static counterparts through openable part detection, motion prediction, and interior geometry completion. We formulate a unified framework to tackle this task, and curate a challenging dataset of openable 3D objects that serves as a test bed for systematic evaluation. Our experiments benchmark methods from prior work, extended and improved methods, and simple yet effective heuristics for the S2O task. We find that turning static 3D objects into interactively openable counterparts is possible but that all methods struggle to generalize to realistic settings of the task, and we highlight promising future work directions. Our work enables efficient creation of interactive 3D objects for robotic manipulation and embodied AI tasks.</p></details> |  |

Many navigation approaches primarily define success by proximity to the target, often overlooking the necessity for optimal positioning that facilitates subsequent manipulation. To address this, we introduce MoMa-Kitchen, a benchmark dataset comprising over 100k samples that provide training data for models to learn optimal final navigation positions for seamless transition to manipulation. Our dataset includes affordance-grounded floor labels collected from diverse kitchen environments, in which robotic mobile manipulators of different models attempt to grasp target objects amidst clutter. Using a fully automated pipeline, we simulate diverse real-world scenarios and generate affordance labels for optimal manipulation positions. Visual data are collected from RGB-D inputs captured by a first-person view camera mounted on the robotic arm, ensuring consistency in viewpoint during data collection. We also develop a lightweight baseline model, NavAff, for navigation affordance grounding that demonstrates promising performance on the MoMa-Kitchen benchmark. Our approach enables models to learn affordance-based final positioning that accommodates different arm types and platform heights, thereby paving the way for more robust and generalizable integration of navigation and manipulation in embodied AI.

| **[Making Every Frame Matter: Continuous Activity Recognition in Streaming Video via Adaptive Video Context Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14993v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video activity recognition has become increasingly important in robots and embodied AI. Recognizing continuous video activities poses considerable challenges due to the fast expansion of streaming video, which contains multi-scale and untrimmed activities. We introduce a novel system, CARS, to overcome these issues through adaptive video context modeling. Adaptive video context modeling refers to selectively maintaining activity-related features in temporal and spatial dimensions. CARS has two key designs. The first is an activity spatial feature extraction by eliminating irrelevant visual features while maintaining recognition accuracy. The second is an activity-aware state update introducing dynamic adaptability to better preserve the video context for multi-scale activity recognition. Our CARS runs at speeds $>$30 FPS on typical edge devices and outperforms all baselines by 1.2\% to 79.7\% in accuracy. Moreover, we explore applying CARS to a large video model as a video encoder. Experimental results show that our CARS can result in a 0.46-point enhancement (on a 5-point scale) on the in-distribution video activity dataset, and an improvement ranging from 1.19\% to 4\% on zero-shot video activity datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[6D Object Pose Tracking in Internet Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10307v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek to extract a temporally consistent 6D pose trajectory of a manipulated object from an Internet instructional video. This is a challenging set-up for current 6D pose estimation methods due to uncontrolled capturing conditions, subtle but dynamic object motions, and the fact that the exact mesh of the manipulated object is not known. To address these challenges, we present the following contributions. First, we develop a new method that estimates the 6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object itself. The method proceeds by (i) retrieving a CAD model similar to the depicted object from a large-scale model database, (ii) 6D aligning the retrieved CAD model with the input image, and (iii) grounding the absolute scale of the object with respect to the scene. Second, we extract smooth 6D object trajectories from Internet videos by carefully tracking the detected objects across video frames. The extracted object trajectories are then retargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a robotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose estimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of instructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object trajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art RGB 6D pose estimation methods. Finally, we show that the 6D object motion estimated from Internet videos can be transferred to a 7-axis robotic manipulator both in a virtual simulator as well as in a real world set-up. We also successfully apply our method to egocentric videos taken from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset, demonstrating potential for Embodied AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[Long-horizon Embodied Planning with Implicit Logical Inference and Hallucination Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15658v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-horizon embodied planning underpins embodied AI. To accomplish long-horizon tasks, one of the most feasible ways is to decompose abstract instructions into a sequence of actionable steps. Foundation models still face logical errors and hallucinations in long-horizon planning, unless provided with highly relevant examples to the tasks. However, providing highly relevant examples for any random task is unpractical. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a novel framework for Real-time Long-horizon Embodied Planning. ReLEP can complete a wide range of long-horizon tasks without in-context examples by learning implicit logical inference through fine-tuning. The fine-tuned large vision-language model formulates plans as sequences of skill functions. These functions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also equipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot Configuration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we propose a data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. When constructing the dataset, we considered the implicit logical relationships, enabling the model to learn implicit logical relationships and dispel hallucinations. Through comprehensive evaluations across various long-horizon tasks, ReLEP demonstrates high success rates and compliance to execution even on unseen tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

The high cost of commercial mobile manipulation robots significantly limits research in real-world scenes. To address this issue, we propose AhaRobot, a low-cost and fully open-source dual-arm mobile manipulation robot system with a hardware cost of only $1,000 (excluding optional computational resources), which is less than 1/15 of the cost of popular mobile robots. The AhaRobot system consists of three components: (1) a novel low-cost hardware architecture primarily composed of off-the-shelf components, (2) an optimized control solution to enhance operational precision integrating dual-motor backlash control and static friction compensation, and (3) a simple remote teleoperation method RoboPilot. We use handles to control the dual arms and pedals for whole-body movement. The teleoperation process is low-burden and easy to operate, much like piloting. RoboPilot is designed for remote data collection in embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RoboPilot significantly enhances data collection efficiency in complex manipulation tasks, achieving a 30% increase compared to methods using 3D mouse and leader-follower systems. It also excels at completing extremely long-horizon tasks in one go. Furthermore, AhaRobot can be used to learn end-to-end policies and autonomously perform complex manipulation tasks, such as pen insertion and cleaning up the floor. We aim to build an affordable yet powerful platform to promote the development of embodied tasks on real devices, advancing more robust and reliable embodied AI.

Current screen based chat-bots do not take advantage of the the full-suite of natural inputs available in XR, including inward facing sensor data, instead they over-rely on explicit voice or text prompts, sometimes paired with multi-modal data dropped as part of the query. We propose a solution that leverages an attention framework that derives context implicitly from user actions, eye-gaze, and contextual memory within the XR environment. Our work minimizes the need for engineered explicit prompts, fostering grounded and intuitive interactions that glean user insights for the chat-bot.</p></details> |  |

The system leverages multiple RGBD cameras and a HoloLens headset for data collection, avoiding the use of expensive 3D scanners or mocap systems. We propose a semi-automatic method for annotating the shape and pose of hands and objects in the collected videos, significantly reducing the annotation time compared to manual labeling. With this system, we captured a video dataset of humans interacting with objects to perform various tasks, including simple pick-and-place actions, handovers between hands, and using objects according to their affordance, which can serve as human demonstrations for research in embodied AI and robot manipulation. Our data capture setup and annotation framework will be available for the community to use in reconstructing 3D shapes of objects and human hands and tracking their poses in videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[CogNav: Cognitive Process Modeling for Object Goal Navigation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10439v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object goal navigation (ObjectNav) is a fundamental task in embodied AI, requiring an agent to locate a target object in previously unseen environments. This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the Effectiveness of a Socratic Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning Method for Task Planning in Robotics, A Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08174v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in reasoning with natural language. Coupled with this development is the emergence of embodied AI in robotics. Despite showing promise for verbal and written reasoning tasks, it remains unknown whether LLMs are capable of navigating complex spatial tasks with physical actions in the real world. To this end, it is of interest to investigate applying LLMs to robotics in zero-shot learning scenarios, and in the absence of fine-tuning - a feat which could significantly improve human-robot interaction, alleviate compute cost, and eliminate low-level programming tasks associated with robot tasks. To explore this question, we apply GPT-4(Omni) with a simulated Tiago robot in Webots engine for an object search task. We evaluate the effectiveness of three reasoning strategies based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sub-task list generation with the Socratic method (SocraCoT) (in order of increasing rigor): (1) Non-CoT/Non-SocraCoT, (2) CoT only, and (3) SocraCoT. Performance was measured in terms of the proportion of tasks successfully completed and execution time (N = 20). Our preliminary results show that when combined with chain-of-thought reasoning, the Socratic method can be used for code generation for robotic tasks that require spatial awareness. In extension of this finding, we propose EVINCE-LoC; a modified EVINCE method that could further enhance performance in highly complex and or dynamic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

Interactive systems assist humans in these tasks, enabling applications in Embodied AI, human-robot interaction, and virtual reality. However, current methods in hand-object synthesis often neglect dynamics and focus on generating static grasps. The first part of this dissertation introduces dynamic grasp synthesis, where a hand grasps and moves an object to a target pose. We approach this task using physical simulation and reinforcement learning. We then extend this to bimanual manipulation and articulated objects, requiring fine-grained coordination between hands. In the second part of this dissertation, we study human-to-robot handovers. We integrate captured human motion into simulation and introduce a student-teacher framework that adapts to human behavior and transfers from sim to real. To overcome data scarcity, we generate synthetic interactions, increasing training diversity by 100x. Our user study finds no difference between policies trained on synthetic vs. real motions.</p></details> | PhD Thesis |

However, real-world datasets often lack sufficient data for training and evaluation, and synthetic datasets, while larger, lack acoustic realism. Consequently, neither effectively meets practical needs. To address this issue, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit based on the embodied AI simulation platform Habitat-sim, designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim supports multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level adjustments, enabling the creation of more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a benchmark dataset called SonicSet, utilizing LibriSpeech, Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K), Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to investigate the differences between synthetic and real-world data, we selected 5 hours of raw, non-reverberant data from the SonicSet validation set and recorded a real-world speech separation dataset, providing a reference for comparing SonicSet with other synthetic datasets. For speech enhancement, we utilized the real-world dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between SonicSet and existing synthetic datasets. The results indicate that models trained on SonicSet generalize better to real-world scenarios compared to other synthetic datasets.

Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI.

As an interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving research domain, "EmAI in healthcare" spans diverse fields such as algorithms, robotics, and biomedicine. This complexity underscores the importance of timely reviews and analyses to track advancements, address challenges, and foster cross-disciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the "brain" of EmAI for healthcare, wherein we introduce foundational AI algorithms for perception, actuation, planning, and memory, and focus on presenting the healthcare applications spanning clinical interventions, daily care & companionship, infrastructure support, and biomedical research.

We discuss the technical barriers and explore ethical considerations, offering a forward-looking perspective on the future of EmAI in healthcare. A hierarchical framework of intelligent levels for EmAI systems is also introduced to guide further development.

Affordance indicates where and how to grasp an object by taking its functionality into account, serving as the foundation for effective task-oriented grasping. However, current task-oriented methods often depend on extensive training data that is confined to specific tasks and objects, making it difficult to generalize to novel objects and complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce AffordGrasp, a novel open-vocabulary grasping framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) for in-context affordance reasoning. Unlike existing methods that rely on explicit task and object specifications, our approach infers tasks directly from implicit user instructions, enabling more intuitive and seamless human-robot interaction in everyday scenarios. Building on the reasoning outcomes, our framework identifies task-relevant objects and grounds their part-level affordances using a visual grounding module. This allows us to generate task-oriented grasp poses precisely within the affordance regions of the object, ensuring both functional and context-aware robotic manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordGrasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of our method. We believe our approach advances robotic manipulation techniques and contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://eqcy.github.io/affordgrasp/.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning.

In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Code and data are available at https://github.com/wz0919/VLN-SRDF</p></details> |

These vulnerabilities manifest through sensor spoofing, adversarial attacks, and failures in task and motion planning, posing significant challenges to robustness and safety. Despite the growing body of research, existing reviews rarely focus specifically on the unique safety and security challenges of embodied AI systems. Most prior work either addresses general AI vulnerabilities or focuses on isolated aspects, lacking a dedicated and unified framework tailored to embodied AI. This survey fills this critical gap by: (1) categorizing vulnerabilities specific to embodied AI into exogenous (e.g., physical attacks, cybersecurity threats) and endogenous (e.g., sensor failures, software flaws) origins; (2) systematically analyzing adversarial attack paradigms unique to embodied AI, with a focus on their impact on perception, decision-making, and embodied interaction; (3) investigating attack vectors targeting large vision-language models (LVLMs) and large language models (LLMs) within embodied systems, such as jailbreak attacks and instruction misinterpretation; (4) evaluating robustness challenges in algorithms for embodied perception, decision-making, and task planning; and (5) proposing targeted strategies to enhance the safety and reliability of embodied AI systems. By integrating these dimensions, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between vulnerabilities and safety in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, the one-to-many nature of the image-to-3D problem limits their use due to inconsistent content and quality across views. Previous models optimize a 3D model by sampling views from a view-conditioned diffusion prior, but diffusion models cannot guarantee view consistency. Instead, we present ConsistentDreamer, where we first generate a set of fixed multi-view prior images and sample random views between them with another diffusion model through a score distillation sampling (SDS) loss. Thereby, we limit the discrepancies between the views guided by the SDS loss and ensure a consistent rough shape. In each iteration, we also use our generated multi-view prior images for fine-detail reconstruction. To balance between the rough shape and the fine-detail optimizations, we introduce dynamic task-dependent weights based on homoscedastic uncertainty, updated automatically in each iteration. Additionally, we employ opacity, depth distortion, and normal alignment losses to refine the surface for mesh extraction. Our method ensures better view consistency and visual quality compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Pattern Recognition Letters.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

To advance Spatial Artificial Intelligence, we pioneer a psychometric framework defining five Basic Spatial Abilities (BSAs) in Visual Language Models (VLMs): Spatial Perception, Spatial Relation, Spatial Orientation, Mental Rotation, and Spatial Visualization. Benchmarking 13 mainstream VLMs through nine validated psychometric experiments reveals significant gaps versus humans (average score 24.95 vs. 68.38), with three key findings: 1) VLMs mirror human hierarchies (strongest in 2D orientation, weakest in 3D rotation) with independent BSAs (Pearson's r<0.4); 2) Smaller models such as Qwen2-VL-7B surpass larger counterparts, with Qwen leading (30.82) and InternVL2 lagging (19.6); 3) Interventions like chain-of-thought (0.100 accuracy gain) and 5-shot training (0.259 improvement) show limits from architectural constraints. Identified barriers include weak geometry encoding and missing dynamic simulation. By linking psychometric BSAs to VLM capabilities, we provide a diagnostic toolkit for spatial intelligence evaluation, methodological foundations for embodied AI development, and a cognitive science-informed roadmap for achieving human-like spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, when powered by open LLMs, they struggle with basic tasks even after domain-specific fine-tuning. We present MindForge, a generative-agent framework for collaborative lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural interagent communication; and (3) a multicomponent memory system. In Minecraft experiments, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks where traditional Voyager fails without GPT-4, collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items and achieving $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones, advancing from basic wood tools to advanced iron equipment. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated collaborative experiences. MindForge advances the democratization of embodied AI development through open-ended social learning, enabling peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.</p></details> |  |

Despite successes in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for high-level traffic scene semantic understanding, it remains challenging to effectively translate these conceptual semantics understandings into low-level motion control commands and achieve generalization and consensus in cross-scene driving. We introduce Sce2DriveX, a human-like driving chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning MLLM framework. Sce2DriveX utilizes multimodal joint learning from local scene videos and global BEV maps to deeply understand long-range spatiotemporal relationships and road topology, enhancing its comprehensive perception and reasoning capabilities in 3D dynamic/static scenes and achieving driving generalization across scenes. Building on this, it reconstructs the implicit cognitive chain inherent in human driving, covering scene understanding, meta-action reasoning, behavior interpretation analysis, motion planning and control, thereby further bridging the gap between autonomous driving and human thought processes. To elevate model performance, we have developed the first extensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) driving instruction dataset tailored for 3D spatial understanding and long-axis task reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sce2DriveX achieves state-of-the-art performance from scene understanding to end-to-end driving, as well as robust generalization on the CARLA Bench2Drive benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoFar: Language-Grounded Orientation Bridges Spatial Reasoning and Object Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13143v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence is a critical component of embodied AI, promoting robots to understand and interact with their environments. While recent advances have enhanced the ability of VLMs to perceive object locations and positional relationships, they still lack the capability to precisely understand object orientations-a key requirement for tasks involving fine-grained manipulations. Addressing this limitation not only requires geometric reasoning but also an expressive and intuitive way to represent orientation. In this context, we propose that natural language offers a more flexible representation space than canonical frames, making it particularly suitable for instruction-following robotic systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic orientation, which defines object orientations using natural language in a reference-frame-free manner (e.g., the ''plug-in'' direction of a USB or the ''handle'' direction of a knife). To support this, we construct OrienText300K, a large-scale dataset of 3D models annotated with semantic orientations that link geometric understanding to functional semantics. By integrating semantic orientation into a VLM system, we enable robots to generate manipulation actions with both positional and orientational constraints. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances robotic manipulation capabilities, e.g., 48.7% accuracy on Open6DOR and 74.9% accuracy on SIMPLER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://qizekun.github.io/sofar/</p></details> |

Recent advances in foundation models pave the way for generative agents capable of richer communication and adaptive problem-solving. This survey provides a systematic examination of how EMAS can benefit from these generative capabilities. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes EMAS by system architectures and embodiment modalities, emphasizing how collaboration spans both physical and virtual contexts. Central building blocks, perception, planning, communication, and feedback, are then analyzed to illustrate how generative techniques bolster system robustness and flexibility. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate the transformative effects of integrating foundation models into embodied, multi-agent frameworks. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions, underlining the significant promise of EMAS to reshape the landscape of AI-driven collaboration.</p></details> | 18 pages |

We propose a novel object-centric latent action learning approach, based on VideoSaur and LAPO, that employs self-supervised decomposition of scenes into object representations and annotates video data with proxy-action labels. This method effectively disentangles causal agent-object interactions from irrelevant background noise and reduces the performance degradation of latent action learning approaches caused by distractors. Our preliminary experiments with the Distracting Control Suite show that latent action pretraining based on object decompositions improve the quality of inferred latent actions by x2.7 and efficiency of downstream fine-tuning with a small set of labeled actions, increasing return by x2.6 on average.</p></details> | Preprint.

| **[POEX: Understanding and Mitigating Policy Executable Jailbreak Attacks against Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16633v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems are rapidly evolving due to the integration of LLMs as planning modules, which transform complex instructions into executable policies. However, LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can generate malicious content. This paper investigates the feasibility and rationale behind applying traditional LLM jailbreak attacks to EAI systems. We aim to answer three questions: (1) Do traditional LLM jailbreak attacks apply to EAI systems? (2) What challenges arise if they do not? and (3) How can we defend against EAI jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first measure existing LLM-based EAI systems using a newly constructed dataset, i.e., the Harmful-RLbench. Our study confirms that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are not directly applicable to EAI systems and identifies two unique challenges. First, the harmful text does not necessarily constitute harmful policies. Second, even if harmful policies can be generated, they are not necessarily executable by the EAI systems, which limits the potential risk. To facilitate a more comprehensive security analysis, we refine and introduce POEX, a novel red teaming framework that optimizes adversarial suffixes to induce harmful yet executable policies against EAI systems. The design of POEX employs adversarial constraints, policy evaluators, and suffix optimization to ensure successful policy execution while evading safety detection inside an EAI system. Experiments on the real-world robotic arm and simulator using Harmful-RLbench demonstrate the efficacy, highlighting severe safety vulnerabilities and high transferability across models. Finally, we propose prompt-based and model-based defenses, achieving an 85% success rate in mitigating attacks and enhancing safety awareness in EAI systems. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust security measures to ensure the safe deployment of EAI in critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://poex-eai-jailbreak.github.io/</p></details> |

These advancements have led to an explosive increase in the demand for computational power, challenging the limits of Moore's Law. Optical lithography, a critical technology in semiconductor manufacturing, faces significant challenges due to its high costs. To address this, various lithography simulators have been developed.

Large Language Model (LLM), which exhibits powerful language understanding abilities, has been extensively employed in embodied AI by facilitating sophisticated task planning. However, a critical safety issue remains overlooked: could these embodied LLMs perpetrate harmful behaviors? In response, we introduce BadRobot, a novel attack paradigm aiming to make embodied LLMs violate safety and ethical constraints through typical voice-based user-system interactions. Specifically, three vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve this type of attack: (i) manipulation of LLMs within robotic systems, (ii) misalignment between linguistic outputs and physical actions, and (iii) unintentional hazardous behaviors caused by world knowledge's flaws. Furthermore, we construct a benchmark of various malicious physical action queries to evaluate BadRobot's attack performance. Based on this benchmark, extensive experiments against existing prominent embodied LLM frameworks (e.g., Voxposer, Code as Policies, and ProgPrompt) demonstrate the effectiveness of our BadRobot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[Beyond 'Aha!': Toward Systematic Meta-Abilities Alignment in Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10554v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) already possess a latent capacity for long chain-of-thought reasoning. Prior work has shown that outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) can incidentally elicit advanced reasoning behaviors such as self-correction, backtracking, and verification phenomena often referred to as the model's "aha moment". However, the timing and consistency of these emergent behaviors remain unpredictable and uncontrollable, limiting the scalability and reliability of LRMs' reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we move beyond reliance on prompts and coincidental "aha moments". Instead, we explicitly align models with three meta-abilities: deduction, induction, and abduction, using automatically generated, self-verifiable tasks. Our three stage-pipeline individual alignment, parameter-space merging, and domain-specific reinforcement learning, boosting performance by over 10\% relative to instruction-tuned baselines. Furthermore, domain-specific RL from the aligned checkpoint yields an additional 2\% average gain in the performance ceiling across math, coding, and science benchmarks, demonstrating that explicit meta-ability alignment offers a scalable and dependable foundation for reasoning.

Enabling the agent to gain a deeper understanding and adapt more efficiently to diverse working scenarios is crucial, and strategic knowledge utilization is a key factor in this process. This paper proposes a Knowledge Capture, Adaptation, and Composition (KCAC) framework to systematically integrate knowledge transfer into RL through cross-task curriculum learning. KCAC is evaluated using a two block stacking task in the CausalWorld benchmark, a complex robotic manipulation environment. To our knowledge, existing RL approaches fail to solve this task effectively, reflecting deficiencies in knowledge capture. In this work, we redesign the benchmark reward function by removing rigid constraints and strict ordering, allowing the agent to maximize total rewards concurrently and enabling flexible task completion. Furthermore, we define two self-designed sub-tasks and implement a structured cross-task curriculum to facilitate efficient learning. As a result, our KCAC approach achieves a 40 percent reduction in training time while improving task success rates by 10 percent compared to traditional RL methods. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key curriculum design parameters subtask selection, transition timing, and learning rate that optimize learning efficiency and provide conceptual guidance for curriculum based RL frameworks. This work offers valuable insights into curriculum design in RL and robotic learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fixing Incomplete Value Function Decomposition for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10484v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Value function decomposition methods for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning compose joint values from individual per-agent utilities, and train them using a joint objective. To ensure that the action selection process between individual utilities and joint values remains consistent, it is imperative for the composition to satisfy the individual-global max (IGM) property. Although satisfying IGM itself is straightforward, most existing methods (e.g., VDN, QMIX) have limited representation capabilities and are unable to represent the full class of IGM values, and the one exception that has no such limitation (QPLEX) is unnecessarily complex. In this work, we present a simple formulation of the full class of IGM values that naturally leads to the derivation of QFIX, a novel family of value function decomposition models that expand the representation capabilities of prior models by means of a thin "fixing" layer. We derive multiple variants of QFIX, and implement three variants in two well-known multi-agent frameworks. We perform an empirical evaluation on multiple SMACv2 and Overcooked environments, which confirms that QFIX (i) succeeds in enhancing the performance of prior methods, (ii) learns more stably and performs better than its main competitor QPLEX, and (iii) achieves this while employing the simplest and smallest mixing models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-tuning Diffusion Policies with Backpropagation Through Diffusion Timesteps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10482v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for main text, 23 pages in total, submitted to Neurips, 13 figures</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcing the Diffusion Chain of Lateral Thought with Diffusion Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10446v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the \emph{Diffusion Chain of Lateral Thought (DCoLT)}, a reasoning framework for diffusion language models. DCoLT treats each intermediate step in the reverse diffusion process as a latent "thinking" action and optimizes the entire reasoning trajectory to maximize the reward on the correctness of the final answer with outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unlike traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods that follow a causal, linear thinking process, DCoLT allows bidirectional, non-linear reasoning with no strict rule on grammatical correctness amid its intermediate steps of thought. We implement DCoLT on two representative Diffusion Language Models (DLMs). First, we choose SEDD as a representative continuous-time discrete diffusion model, where its concrete score derives a probabilistic policy to maximize the RL reward over the entire sequence of intermediate diffusion steps. We further consider the discrete-time masked diffusion language model -- LLaDA, and find that the order to predict and unmask tokens plays an essential role to optimize its RL action resulting from the ranking-based Unmasking Policy Module (UPM) defined by the Plackett-Luce model. Experiments on both math and code generation tasks show that using only public data and 16 H800 GPUs, DCoLT-reinforced DLMs outperform other DLMs trained by SFT or RL or even both. Notably, DCoLT-reinforced LLaDA boosts its reasoning accuracy by +9.8%, +5.7%, +11.4%, +19.5% on GSM8K, MATH, MBPP, and HumanEval.</p></details> |  |
| **[IN-RIL: Interleaved Reinforcement and Imitation Learning for Policy Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10442v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) each offer distinct advantages for robotics policy learning: IL provides stable learning from demonstrations, and RL promotes generalization through exploration. While existing robot learning approaches using IL-based pre-training followed by RL-based fine-tuning are promising, this two-step learning paradigm often suffers from instability and poor sample efficiency during the RL fine-tuning phase. In this work, we introduce IN-RIL, INterleaved Reinforcement learning and Imitation Learning, for policy fine-tuning, which periodically injects IL updates after multiple RL updates and hence can benefit from the stability of IL and the guidance of expert data for more efficient exploration throughout the entire fine-tuning process. Since IL and RL involve different optimization objectives, we develop gradient separation mechanisms to prevent destructive interference during \ABBR fine-tuning, by separating possibly conflicting gradient updates in orthogonal subspaces. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous analysis, and our findings shed light on why interleaving IL with RL stabilizes learning and improves sample-efficiency. Extensive experiments on 14 robot manipulation and locomotion tasks across 3 benchmarks, including FurnitureBench, OpenAI Gym, and Robomimic, demonstrate that \ABBR can significantly improve sample efficiency and mitigate performance collapse during online finetuning in both long- and short-horizon tasks with either sparse or dense rewards. IN-RIL, as a general plug-in compatible with various state-of-the-art RL algorithms, can significantly improve RL fine-tuning, e.g., from 12\% to 88\% with 6.3x improvement in the success rate on Robomimic Transport.

| **[Learning to Think: Information-Theoretic Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10425v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks thanks to advances in reasoning abilities. However, existing methods overlook the trade-off between reasoning effectiveness and computational efficiency, often encouraging unnecessarily long reasoning chains and wasting tokens. To address this, we propose Learning to Think (L2T), an information-theoretic reinforcement fine-tuning framework for LLMs to make the models achieve optimal reasoning with fewer tokens. Specifically, L2T treats each query-response interaction as a hierarchical session of multiple episodes and proposes a universal dense process reward, i.e., quantifies the episode-wise information gain in parameters, requiring no extra annotations or task-specific evaluators. We propose a method to quickly estimate this reward based on PAC-Bayes bounds and the Fisher information matrix. Theoretical analyses show that it significantly reduces computational complexity with high estimation accuracy. By immediately rewarding each episode's contribution and penalizing excessive updates, L2T optimizes the model via reinforcement learning to maximize the use of each episode and achieve effective updates. Empirical results on various reasoning benchmarks and base models demonstrate the advantage of L2T across different tasks, boosting both reasoning effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decomposed Inductive Procedure Learning: Learning Academic Tasks with Human-Like Data Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10422v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human learning relies on specialization -- distinct cognitive mechanisms working together to enable rapid learning. In contrast, most modern neural networks rely on a single mechanism: gradient descent over an objective function. This raises the question: might human learners' relatively rapid learning from just tens of examples instead of tens of thousands in data-driven deep learning arise from our ability to use multiple specialized mechanisms of learning in combination? We investigate this question through an ablation analysis of inductive human learning simulations in online tutoring environments. Comparing reinforcement learning to a more data-efficient 3-mechanism symbolic rule induction approach, we find that decomposing learning into multiple distinct mechanisms significantly improves data efficiency, bringing it in line with human learning. Furthermore, we show that this decomposition has a greater impact on efficiency than the distinction between symbolic and subsymbolic learning alone. Efforts to align data-driven machine learning with human learning often overlook the stark difference in learning efficiency. Our findings suggest that integrating multiple specialized learning mechanisms may be key to bridging this gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CogSci 2025</p></details> |

Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) Q-learning, which introduces a relaxation factor to speed up convergence, addresses this issue but has two major limitations: In the tabular setting, the relaxation parameter depends on transition probability, making it not entirely model-free, and it suffers from overestimation bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a sample-based, model-free double SOR Q-learning algorithm. Theoretically and empirically, this algorithm is shown to be less biased than SOR Q-learning. Further, in the tabular setting, the convergence analysis under boundedness assumptions on iterates is discussed. The proposed algorithm is extended to large-scale problems using deep RL. Finally, the tabular version of the proposed algorithm is compared using roulette and grid world environments, while the deep RL version is tested on a maximization bias example and OpenAI Gym environments.</p></details> |  |

While deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown an impressive ability to learn optimal policies in stationary environments, most methods are data intensive and assume a world that does not change between training and test time. As a result, conventional RL methods struggle to adapt when conditions change. This poses a fundamental challenge: how can RL agents efficiently adapt their behavior when encountering novel environmental changes during deployment without catastrophically forgetting useful prior knowledge? This dissertation demonstrates that efficient online adaptation requires two key capabilities: (1) prioritized exploration and sampling strategies that help identify and learn from relevant experiences, and (2) selective preservation of prior knowledge through structured representations that can be updated without disruption to reusable components.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD D...</summary><p>PhD Dissertation, 131 pages</p></details> |

In particular, the recent release of DeepSeek-R1 has generated widespread social impact and sparked enthusiasm in the research community for exploring the explicit reasoning paradigm of language models. However, the implementation details of the released models have not been fully open-sourced by DeepSeek, including DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and the distilled small models. As a result, many replication studies have emerged aiming to reproduce the strong performance achieved by DeepSeek-R1, reaching comparable performance through similar training procedures and fully open-source data resources. These works have investigated feasible strategies for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), focusing on data preparation and method design, yielding various valuable insights. In this report, we provide a summary of recent replication studies to inspire future research. We primarily focus on SFT and RLVR as two main directions, introducing the details for data construction, method design and training procedure of current replication studies. Moreover, we conclude key findings from the implementation details and experimental results reported by these studies, anticipating to inspire future research. We also discuss additional techniques of enhancing RLMs, highlighting the potential of expanding the application scope of these models, and discussing the challenges in development. By this survey, we aim to help researchers and developers of RLMs stay updated with the latest advancements, and seek to inspire new ideas to further enhance RLMs.</p></details> |  |

Improved judgment ability is enabled by stronger chain-of-thought reasoning, motivating the need to find the best recipes for training such models to think. In this work we introduce J1, a reinforcement learning approach to training such models. Our method converts both verifiable and non-verifiable prompts to judgment tasks with verifiable rewards that incentivize thinking and mitigate judgment bias. In particular, our approach outperforms all other existing 8B or 70B models when trained at those sizes, including models distilled from DeepSeek-R1. J1 also outperforms o1-mini, and even R1 on some benchmarks, despite training a smaller model. We provide analysis and ablations comparing Pairwise-J1 vs Pointwise-J1 models, offline vs online training recipes, reward strategies, seed prompts, and variations in thought length and content. We find that our models make better judgments by learning to outline evaluation criteria, comparing against self-generated reference answers, and re-evaluating the correctness of model responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 tables, 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Electric Bus Charging Scheduling with Uncertainties Using Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10296v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of Electric Buses (EBs) represents a significant step toward sustainable development. By utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) systems, charging stations can autonomously determine charging schedules based on real-time data. However, optimizing EB charging schedules remains a critical challenge due to uncertainties in travel time, energy consumption, and fluctuating electricity prices. Moreover, to address real-world complexities, charging policies must make decisions efficiently across multiple time scales and remain scalable for large EB fleets. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) approach that reformulates the original Markov Decision Process (MDP) into two augmented MDPs. To solve these MDPs and enable multi-timescale decision-making, we introduce a novel HDRL algorithm, namely Double Actor-Critic Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization Enhancement (DAC-MAPPO-E). Scalability challenges of the Double Actor-Critic (DAC) algorithm for large-scale EB fleets are addressed through enhancements at both decision levels. At the high level, we redesign the decentralized actor network and integrate an attention mechanism to extract relevant global state information for each EB, decreasing the size of neural networks. At the low level, the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm is incorporated into the DAC framework, enabling decentralized and coordinated charging power decisions, reducing computational complexity and enhancing convergence speed. Extensive experiments with real-world data demonstrate the superior performance and scalability of DAC-MAPPO-E in optimizing EB fleet charging schedules.</p></details> |  |
| **[Electric Bus Charging Schedules Relying on Real Data-Driven Targets Based on Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10262v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The charging scheduling problem of Electric Buses (EBs) is investigated based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is conceived, where the time horizon includes multiple charging and operating periods in a day, while each period is further divided into multiple time steps. To overcome the challenge of long-range multi-phase planning with sparse reward, we conceive Hierarchical DRL (HDRL) for decoupling the original MDP into a high-level Semi-MDP (SMDP) and multiple low-level MDPs. The Hierarchical Double Deep Q-Network (HDDQN)-Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) algorithm is proposed for simultaneously solving the decision problems arising at different temporal resolutions. As a result, the high-level agent learns an effective policy for prescribing the charging targets for every charging period, while the low-level agent learns an optimal policy for setting the charging power of every time step within a single charging period, with the aim of minimizing the charging costs while meeting the charging target. It is proved that the flat policy constructed by superimposing the optimal high-level policy and the optimal low-level policy performs as well as the optimal policy of the original MDP. Since jointly learning both levels of policies is challenging due to the non-stationarity of the high-level agent and the sampling inefficiency of the low-level agent, we divide the joint learning process into two phases and exploit our new HER algorithm to manipulate the experience replay buffers for both levels of agents. Numerical experiments are performed with the aid of real-world data to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

We highlight two key contributions: (a) Theoretically, for the first time, we prove that enhancing the policy robustness to irrelevant features leads to improved generalization performance. (b) Empirically, we demonstrate that mutual distillation between policies contributes to such robustness, enabling the spontaneous emergence of invariant representations over pixel inputs. Overall, our findings challenge the conventional view of distillation as merely a means of knowledge transfer, offering a novel perspective on the generalization in deep reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAIDEN-R1: Improving Role-awareness of LLMs via GRPO with Verifiable Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10218v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Role-playing conversational agents (RPCAs) face persistent challenges in maintaining role consistency. To address this, we propose RAIDEN-R1, a novel reinforcement learning framework that integrates Verifiable Role-Awareness Reward (VRAR). The method introduces both singular and multi-term mining strategies to generate quantifiable rewards by assessing role-specific keys. Additionally, we construct a high-quality, role-aware Chain-of-Thought dataset through multi-LLM collaboration, and implement experiments to enhance reasoning coherence. Experiments on the RAIDEN benchmark demonstrate RAIDEN-R1's superiority: our 14B-GRPO model achieves 88.04% and 88.65% accuracy on Script-Based Knowledge and Conversation Memory metrics, respectively, outperforming baseline models while maintaining robustness. Case analyses further reveal the model's enhanced ability to resolve conflicting contextual cues and sustain first-person narrative consistency. This work bridges the non-quantifiability gap in RPCA training and provides insights into role-aware reasoning patterns, advancing the development of RPCAs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Progress Driven Multi-Agent Curriculum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10016v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The number of agents can be an effective curriculum variable for controlling the difficulty of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks. Existing work typically uses manually defined curricula such as linear schemes. We identify two potential flaws while applying existing reward-based automatic curriculum learning methods in MARL: (1) The expected episode return used to measure task difficulty has high variance; (2) Credit assignment difficulty can be exacerbated in tasks where increasing the number of agents yields higher returns which is common in many MARL tasks. To address these issues, we propose to control the curriculum by using a TD-error based *learning progress* measure and by letting the curriculum proceed from an initial context distribution to the final task specific one. Since our approach maintains a distribution over the number of agents and measures learning progress rather than absolute performance, which often increases with the number of agents, we alleviate problem (2). Moreover, the learning progress measure naturally alleviates problem (1) by aggregating returns. In three challenging sparse-reward MARL benchmarks, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

However, when training reasoning models, these approaches are primarily applicable to specific domains such as mathematics and programming, which imposes fundamental constraints on the breadth and scalability of training data. In contrast, continual pretraining (CPT) offers the advantage of not requiring task-specific signals. Nevertheless, how to effectively synthesize training data for reasoning and how such data affect a wide range of domains remain largely unexplored. This study provides a detailed evaluation of Reasoning CPT, a form of CPT that uses synthetic data to reconstruct the hidden thought processes underlying texts, based on the premise that texts are the result of the author's thinking process. Specifically, we apply Reasoning CPT to Gemma2-9B using synthetic data with hidden thoughts derived from STEM and Law corpora, and compare it to standard CPT on the MMLU benchmark. Our analysis reveals that Reasoning CPT consistently improves performance across all evaluated domains. Notably, reasoning skills acquired in one domain transfer effectively to others; the performance gap with conventional methods widens as problem difficulty increases, with gains of up to 8 points on the most challenging problems. Furthermore, models trained with hidden thoughts learn to adjust the depth of their reasoning according to problem difficulty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk-sensitive Reinforcement Learning Based on Convex Scoring Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04553v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework under a broad class of risk objectives, characterized by convex scoring functions. This class covers many common risk measures, such as variance, Expected Shortfall, entropic Value-at-Risk, and mean-risk utility. To resolve the time-inconsistency issue, we consider an augmented state space and an auxiliary variable and recast the problem as a two-state optimization problem. We propose a customized Actor-Critic algorithm and establish some theoretical approximation guarantees. A key theoretical contribution is that our results do not require the Markov decision process to be continuous. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary variable sampling method inspired by the alternating minimization algorithm, which is convergent under certain conditions. We validate our approach in simulation experiments with a financial application in statistical arbitrage trading, demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm.</p></details> | 35 pages |

However, the most effective way of guiding novice teachers to approach expert-level demonstrations quantitatively for specific teaching tasks remains an open question. To this end, this paper investigates the use of machine teaching (MT) to guide novice teachers to improve their teaching skills based on reinforcement learning from demonstration (RLfD). The paper reports an experiment in which novices receive MT-derived guidance to train their ability to teach a given motor skill with only 8 demonstrations and generalise this to previously unseen ones. Results indicate that the MT-guidance not only enhances robot learning performance by 89% on the training skill but also causes a 70% improvement in robot learning performance on skills not seen by subjects during training. These findings highlight the effectiveness of MT-guidance in upskilling human teaching behaviours, ultimately improving demonstration quality in RLfD.</p></details> | 6 pages |

In this paper, we evaluate the resilience of a DRL-based agent designed to capture floating waste under various perturbations. We train the agent using domain randomization and evaluate its performance in real-world field tests, assessing its ability to handle unexpected disturbances such as asymmetric drag and an off-center payload. We assess the agent's performance under these perturbations in both simulation and real-world experiments, quantifying performance degradation and benchmarking it against an MPC baseline. Results indicate that the DRL agent performs reliably despite significant disturbances. Along with the open-source release of our implementation, we provide insights into effective training strategies, real-world challenges, and practical considerations for deploying DRLbased ASV controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on Field Robotics at ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, directly applying RL training with the GRPO algorithm to video reasoning presents two primary challenges: (i) a lack of temporal modeling for video reasoning, and (ii) the scarcity of high-quality video-reasoning data. To address these issues, we first propose the T-GRPO algorithm, which encourages models to utilize temporal information in videos for reasoning. Additionally, instead of relying solely on video data, we incorporate high-quality image-reasoning data into the training process. We have constructed two datasets: Video-R1-CoT-165k for SFT cold start and Video-R1-260k for RL training, both comprising image and video data. Experimental results demonstrate that Video-R1 achieves significant improvements on video reasoning benchmarks such as VideoMMMU and VSI-Bench, as well as on general video benchmarks including MVBench and TempCompass, etc. Notably, Video-R1-7B attains a 37.1% accuracy on video spatial reasoning benchmark VSI-bench, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o.

Existing deep learning methods have made progress but still face limitations in handling complex scenes and preserving image details. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based latent diffusion model (LDM) fine-tuning method for remote sensing image super-resolution. The method constructs a reinforcement learning environment with states, actions, and rewards, optimizing decision objectives through proximal policy optimization (PPO) during the reverse denoising process of the LDM model. Experiments on the RESISC45 dataset show significant improvements over the baseline model in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, with PSNR increasing by 3-4dB, SSIM improving by 0.08-0.11, and LPIPS reducing by 0.06-0.10, particularly in structured and complex natural scenes. The results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in enhancing super-resolution quality and adaptability across scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 4th International Conference on Computing Innovation and Applied Physics (CONF-CIAP 2025), and will be published in EAI Community Research Series-CORE or Theoretical and Natural Science (TNS)</p></details> |
| **[APEX: Action Priors Enable Efficient Exploration for Skill Imitation on Articulated Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10022v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning by imitation provides an effective way for robots to develop well-regulated complex behaviors and directly benefit from natural demonstrations. State-of-the-art imitation learning (IL) approaches typically leverage Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP), which, despite their impressive results, suffer from two key limitations. They are prone to mode collapse, which often leads to overfitting to the simulation environment and thus increased sim-to-real gap, and they struggle to learn diverse behaviors effectively. To overcome these limitations, we introduce APEX (Action Priors enable Efficient eXploration): a simple yet versatile imitation learning framework that integrates demonstrations directly into reinforcement learning (RL), maintaining high exploration while grounding behavior with expert-informed priors. We achieve this through a combination of decaying action priors, which initially bias exploration toward expert demonstrations but gradually allow the policy to explore independently. This is complemented by a multi-critic RL framework that effectively balances stylistic consistency with task performance. Our approach achieves sample-efficient imitation learning and enables the acquisition of diverse skills within a single policy. APEX generalizes to varying velocities and preserves reference-like styles across complex tasks such as navigating rough terrain and climbing stairs, utilizing only flat-terrain kinematic motion data as a prior. We validate our framework through extensive hardware experiments on the Unitree Go2 quadruped. There, APEX yields diverse and agile locomotion gaits, inherent gait transitions, and the highest reported speed for the platform to the best of our knowledge (peak velocity of ~3.3 m/s on hardware). Our results establish APEX as a compelling alternative to existing IL methods, offering better efficiency, adaptability, and real-world performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImagineBench: Evaluating Reinforcement Learning with Large Language Model Rollouts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10010v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is its dependence on extensive real-world interaction data to learn task-specific policies. While recent work demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can mitigate this limitation by generating synthetic experience (noted as imaginary rollouts) for mastering novel tasks, progress in this emerging field is hindered due to the lack of a standard benchmark. To bridge this gap, we introduce ImagineBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating offline RL algorithms that leverage both real rollouts and LLM-imaginary rollouts. The key features of ImagineBench include: (1) datasets comprising environment-collected and LLM-imaginary rollouts; (2) diverse domains of environments covering locomotion, robotic manipulation, and navigation tasks; and (3) natural language task instructions with varying complexity levels to facilitate language-conditioned policy learning. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms, we observe that simply applying existing offline RL algorithms leads to suboptimal performance on unseen tasks, achieving 35.44% success rate in hard tasks in contrast to 64.37% of method training on real rollouts for hard tasks. This result highlights the need for algorithm advancements to better leverage LLM-imaginary rollouts. Additionally, we identify key opportunities for future research: including better utilization of imaginary rollouts, fast online adaptation and continual learning, and extension to multi-modal tasks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/LAMDA-RL/ImagineBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sample Complexity of Distributionally Robust Average-Reward Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10007v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by practical applications where stable long-term performance is critical-such as robotics, operations research, and healthcare-we study the problem of distributionally robust (DR) average-reward reinforcement learning. We propose two algorithms that achieve near-optimal sample complexity. The first reduces the problem to a DR discounted Markov decision process (MDP), while the second, Anchored DR Average-Reward MDP, introduces an anchoring state to stabilize the controlled transition kernels within the uncertainty set. Assuming the nominal MDP is uniformly ergodic, we prove that both algorithms attain a sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(|\mathbf{S}||\mathbf{A}| t_{\mathrm{mix}}^2\varepsilon^{-2}\right)$ for estimating the optimal policy as well as the robust average reward under KL and $f_k$-divergence-based uncertainty sets, provided the uncertainty radius is sufficiently small. Here, $\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $|\mathbf{S}|$ and $|\mathbf{A}|$ denote the sizes of the state and action spaces, and $t_{\mathrm{mix}}$ is the mixing time of the nominal MDP. This represents the first finite-sample convergence guarantee for DR average-reward reinforcement learning. We further validate the convergence rates of our algorithms through numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

My work focuses on reinforcement learning (RL), multi-armed bandits, and their applications, including recommendation systems, computer networks, video analytics, and large language models (LLMs). Sequential decision-making methods, such as bandits and RL, have demonstrated remarkable success - ranging from outperforming human players in complex games like Atari and Go to advancing robotics, recommendation systems, and fine-tuning LLMs. Despite these successes, many established algorithms rely on idealized models that can fail under model misspecifications or adversarial perturbations, particularly in settings where accurate prior knowledge of the underlying model class is unavailable or where malicious users operate within dynamic systems. These challenges are pervasive in real-world applications, where robust and adaptive solutions are critical. Furthermore, while worst-case guarantees provide theoretical reliability, they often fail to capture instance-dependent performance, which can lead to more efficient and practical solutions. Another key challenge lies in generalizing to new, unseen environments, a crucial requirement for deploying these methods in dynamic and unpredictable settings. To address these limitations, my research aims to develop more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable sequential decision-making algorithms for both reinforcement learning and bandits. Towards this end, I focus on developing more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable for both general reinforcement learning (RL) and bandits.</p></details> | Ph.D. Thesis |

In this work, we propose that sharing the approximated behavior metric-based state projection function is a promising way to enhance the performance of FRL and concurrently provides an effective protection of sensitive information. We introduce FedRAG, a FRL framework to learn a computationally practical projection function of states for each client and aggregating the parameters of projection functions at a central server. The FedRAG approach shares no sensitive task-specific information, yet provides information gain for each client. We conduct extensive experiments on the DeepMind Control Suite to demonstrate insightful results.</p></details> |  |
| **[RM-R1: Reward Modeling as Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02387v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences through reinforcement learning (RL). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a score or a judgment. Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's interpretability and performance. To this end, we introduce a new class of generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. RM-R1 features a chain-of-rubrics (CoR) mechanism -- self-generating sample-level chat rubrics or math/code solutions, and evaluating candidate responses against them. The training of M-R1 consists of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Empirically, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across three reward model benchmarks on average, outperforming much larger open-weight models (e.g., INF-ORM-Llama3.1-70B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by up to 4.9%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate future research, we release six ReasRM models along with code and data at https://github.com/RM-R1-UIUC/RM-R1.</p></details> | 24 pages, 8 figures |

In this work, we revisit the core principles of reinforcement learning (RL) and, through mathematical analysis, demonstrate that the tendency to generate lengthy responses arises inherently from RL-based optimization during training. This finding questions the prevailing assumption that longer responses inherently improve reasoning accuracy. Instead, we uncover a natural correlation between conciseness and accuracy that has been largely overlooked. We show that introducing a secondary phase of RL training, using a very small set of problems, can significantly reduce chains of thought while maintaining or even enhancing accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that, while GRPO shares some interesting properties of PPO, it suffers from collapse modes, which limit its reliability for concise reasoning. Finally, we validate our conclusions through extensive experimental results.</p></details> |  |

Some risk-averse strategies, e.g., the conditional value-at-risk principle, are incorporated in domain randomization or meta reinforcement learning to prioritize difficult tasks in optimization, which demand costly intensive evaluations. The efficiency issue prompts the development of robust active task sampling to train adaptive policies, where risk-predictive models are used to surrogate policy evaluation. This work characterizes the optimization pipeline of robust active task sampling as a Markov decision process, posits theoretical and practical insights, and constitutes robustness concepts in risk-averse scenarios. Importantly, we propose an easy-to-implement method, referred to as Posterior and Diversity Synergized Task Sampling (PDTS), to accommodate fast and robust sequential decision-making. Extensive experiments show that PDTS unlocks the potential of robust active task sampling, significantly improves the zero-shot and few-shot adaptation robustness in challenging tasks, and even accelerates the learning process under certain scenarios.

Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world, X-Sim introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes.

Although many models are aligned using techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), they are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. Some of the existing adversarial attack methods search for discrete tokens that may jailbreak a target model while others try to optimize the continuous space represented by the tokens of the model's vocabulary. While techniques based on the discrete space may prove to be inefficient, optimization of continuous token embeddings requires projections to produce discrete tokens, which might render them ineffective. To fully utilize the constraints and the structures of the space, we develop an intrinsic optimization technique using exponentiated gradient descent with the Bregman projection method to ensure that the optimized one-hot encoding always stays within the probability simplex. We prove the convergence of the technique and implement an efficient algorithm that is effective in jailbreaking several widely used LLMs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique using five open-source LLMs on four openly available datasets. The results show that the technique achieves a higher success rate with great efficiency compared to three other state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques.

| **[Aligning Transformers with Continuous Feedback via Energy Rank Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12961v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Searching through chemical space is an exceptionally challenging problem because the number of possible molecules grows combinatorially with the number of atoms. Large, autoregressive models trained on databases of chemical compounds have yielded powerful generators, but we still lack robust strategies for generating molecules with desired properties. This molecular search problem closely resembles the "alignment" problem for large language models, though for many chemical tasks we have a specific and easily evaluable reward function. Here, we introduce an algorithm called energy rank alignment (ERA) that leverages an explicit reward function to produce a gradient-based objective that we use to optimize autoregressive policies. We show theoretically that this algorithm is closely related to proximal policy optimization (PPO) and direct preference optimization (DPO), but has a minimizer that converges to an ideal Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution with the reward playing the role of an energy function. Furthermore, this algorithm is highly scalable, does not require reinforcement learning, and performs well relative to DPO when the number of preference observations per pairing is small. We deploy this approach to align molecular transformers and protein language models to generate molecules and protein sequences, respectively, with externally specified properties and find that it does so robustly, searching through diverse parts of chemical space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Centrally Coordinated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Power Grid Topology Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08681v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Power grid operation is becoming more complex due to the increase in generation of renewable energy. The recent series of Learning To Run a Power Network (L2RPN) competitions have encouraged the use of artificial agents to assist human dispatchers in operating power grids. However, the combinatorial nature of the action space poses a challenge to both conventional optimizers and learned controllers. Action space factorization, which breaks down decision-making into smaller sub-tasks, is one approach to tackle the curse of dimensionality. In this study, we propose a centrally coordinated multi-agent (CCMA) architecture for action space factorization. In this approach, regional agents propose actions and subsequently a coordinating agent selects the final action. We investigate several implementations of the CCMA architecture, and benchmark in different experimental settings against various L2RPN baseline approaches. The CCMA architecture exhibits higher sample efficiency and superior final performance than the baseline approaches. The results suggest high potential of the CCMA approach for further application in higher-dimensional L2RPN as well as real-world power grid settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted version to The 16th ACM International Conference on Future and Sustainable Energy Systems.

| **[Community-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Transfer and Active Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09756v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the agents cooperate in a time-evolving network with latent community structures and mixed memberships. Unlike traditional neighbor-based or fixed interaction graphs, our community-based framework captures flexible and abstract coordination patterns by allowing each agent to belong to multiple overlapping communities. Each community maintains shared policy and value functions, which are aggregated by individual agents according to personalized membership weights. We also design actor-critic algorithms that exploit this structure: agents inherit community-level estimates for policy updates and value learning, enabling structured information sharing without requiring access to other agents' policies. Importantly, our approach supports both transfer learning by adapting to new agents or tasks via membership estimation, and active learning by prioritizing uncertain communities during exploration. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees under linear function approximation for both actor and critic updates. To our knowledge, this is the first MARL framework that integrates community structure, transferability, and active learning with provable guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[On-Robot Reinforcement Learning with Goal-Contrastive Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19989v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to enable robots to learn from their own actions in the real world. Unfortunately, RL can be prohibitively expensive, in terms of on-robot runtime, due to inefficient exploration when learning from a sparse reward signal. Designing dense reward functions is labour-intensive and requires domain expertise. In our work, we propose GCR (Goal-Contrastive Rewards), a dense reward function learning method that can be trained on passive video demonstrations. By using videos without actions, our method is easier to scale, as we can use arbitrary videos. GCR combines two loss functions, an implicit value loss function that models how the reward increases when traversing a successful trajectory, and a goal-contrastive loss that discriminates between successful and failed trajectories. We perform experiments in simulated manipulation environments across RoboMimic and MimicGen tasks, as well as in the real world using a Franka arm and a Spot quadruped. We find that GCR leads to a more-sample efficient RL, enabling model-free RL to solve about twice as many tasks as our baseline reward learning methods. We also demonstrate positive cross-embodiment transfer from videos of people and of other robots performing a task. Website: https://gcr-robot.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk-Aware Safe Reinforcement Learning for Control of Stochastic Linear Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09734v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a risk-aware safe reinforcement learning (RL) control design for stochastic discrete-time linear systems. Rather than using a safety certifier to myopically intervene with the RL controller, a risk-informed safe controller is also learned besides the RL controller, and the RL and safe controllers are combined together. Several advantages come along with this approach: 1) High-confidence safety can be certified without relying on a high-fidelity system model and using limited data available, 2) Myopic interventions and convergence to an undesired equilibrium can be avoided by deciding on the contribution of two stabilizing controllers, and 3) highly efficient and computationally tractable solutions can be provided by optimizing over a scalar decision variable and linear programming polyhedral sets. To learn safe controllers with a large invariant set, piecewise affine controllers are learned instead of linear controllers. To this end, the closed-loop system is first represented using collected data, a decision variable, and noise. The effect of the decision variable on the variance of the safe violation of the closed-loop system is formalized. The decision variable is then designed such that the probability of safety violation for the learned closed-loop system is minimized. It is shown that this control-oriented approach reduces the data requirements and can also reduce the variance of safety violations. Finally, to integrate the safe and RL controllers, a new data-driven interpolation technique is introduced. This method aims to maintain the RL agent's optimal implementation while ensuring its safety within environments characterized by noise. The study concludes with a simulation example that serves to validate the theoretical results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Asian Journal of Control</p></details> |

Learning from visual observations further exacerbates this difficulty. In this work, we explore highly data-driven approaches to visual whole-body humanoid control based on reinforcement learning, without any simplifying assumptions, reward design, or skill primitives. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical world model in which a high-level agent generates commands based on visual observations for a low-level agent to execute, both of which are trained with rewards. Our approach produces highly performant control policies in 8 tasks with a simulated 56-DoF humanoid, while synthesizing motions that are broadly preferred by humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and videos at https://nicklashansen.com/rlpuppeteer</p></details> |
| **[Temporal-Difference Variational Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07812v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning models in real-world applications must continuously learn new tasks to adapt to shifts in the data-generating distribution. Yet, for Continual Learning (CL), models often struggle to balance learning new tasks (plasticity) with retaining previous knowledge (memory stability). Consequently, they are susceptible to Catastrophic Forgetting, which degrades performance and undermines the reliability of deployed systems. In the Bayesian CL literature, variational methods tackle this challenge by employing a learning objective that recursively updates the posterior distribution while constraining it to stay close to its previous estimate. Nonetheless, we argue that these methods may be ineffective due to compounding approximation errors over successive recursions. To mitigate this, we propose new learning objectives that integrate the regularization effects of multiple previous posterior estimations, preventing individual errors from dominating future posterior updates and compounding over time. We reveal insightful connections between these objectives and Temporal-Difference methods, a popular learning mechanism in Reinforcement Learning and Neuroscience. Experiments on challenging CL benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates Catastrophic Forgetting, outperforming strong Variational CL methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ethics and Persuasion in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback: A Procedural Rhetorical Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09576v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since 2022, versions of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Claude have been trained using a specialized technique called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune language model output using feedback from human annotators. As a result, the integration of RLHF has greatly enhanced the outputs of these large language models (LLMs) and made the interactions and responses appear more "human-like" than those of previous versions using only supervised learning. The increasing convergence of human and machine-written text has potentially severe ethical, sociotechnical, and pedagogical implications relating to transparency, trust, bias, and interpersonal relations. To highlight these implications, this paper presents a rhetorical analysis of some of the central procedures and processes currently being reshaped by RLHF-enhanced generative AI chatbots: upholding language conventions, information seeking practices, and expectations for social relationships. Rhetorical investigations of generative AI and LLMs have, to this point, focused largely on the persuasiveness of the content generated. Using Ian Bogost's concept of procedural rhetoric, this paper shifts the site of rhetorical investigation from content analysis to the underlying mechanisms of persuasion built into RLHF-enhanced LLMs. In doing so, this theoretical investigation opens a new direction for further inquiry in AI ethics that considers how procedures rerouted through AI-driven technologies might reinforce hegemonic language use, perpetuate biases, decontextualize learning, and encroach upon human relationships. It will therefore be of interest to educators, researchers, scholars, and the growing number of users of generative AI chatbots.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, Accepted version</p></details> |

Recently, multi-task learning has gained much attention for solving VRP variants. However, this adaptability often compromises the performance of the models. To address this challenge, we first pre-train a reinforcement learning model on the multi-depot VRP, followed by a short fine-tuning phase to adapt it to different variants. By leveraging the complexity of the multi-depot VRP, the pre-trained model learns richer node representations and gains more transferable knowledge compared to models trained on simpler routing problems, such as the traveling salesman problem. TuneNSearch employs, in the first stage, a Transformer-based architecture, augmented with a residual edge-graph attention network to capture the impact of edge distances and residual connections between layers. This architecture allows for a more precise capture of graph-structured data, improving the encoding of VRP's features. After inference, our model is also coupled with a second stage composed of a local search algorithm, which yields substantial performance gains with minimal computational overhead added. Results show that TuneNSearch outperforms many existing state-of-the-art models trained for each VRP variant, requiring only one-fifth of the training epochs. Our approach demonstrates strong generalization, achieving high performance across different tasks, distributions and problem sizes, thus addressing a long-standing gap in the literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[WavReward: Spoken Dialogue Models With Generalist Reward Evaluators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09558v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end spoken dialogue models such as GPT-4o-audio have recently garnered significant attention in the speech domain. However, the evaluation of spoken dialogue models' conversational performance has largely been overlooked. This is primarily due to the intelligent chatbots convey a wealth of non-textual information which cannot be easily measured using text-based language models like ChatGPT. To address this gap, we propose WavReward, a reward feedback model based on audio language models that can evaluate both the IQ and EQ of spoken dialogue systems with speech input. Specifically, 1) based on audio language models, WavReward incorporates the deep reasoning process and the nonlinear reward mechanism for post-training. By utilizing multi-sample feedback via the reinforcement learning algorithm, we construct a specialized evaluator tailored to spoken dialogue models. 2) We introduce ChatReward-30K, a preference dataset used to train WavReward. ChatReward-30K includes both comprehension and generation aspects of spoken dialogue models. These scenarios span various tasks, such as text-based chats, nine acoustic attributes of instruction chats, and implicit chats. WavReward outperforms previous state-of-the-art evaluation models across multiple spoken dialogue scenarios, achieving a substantial improvement about Qwen2.5-Omni in objective accuracy from 55.1$\%$ to 91.5$\%$. In subjective A/B testing, WavReward also leads by a margin of 83$\%$. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each component of WavReward. All data and code will be publicly at https://github.com/jishengpeng/WavReward after the paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |

The family comes in three sizes -- Nano (8B), Super (49B), and Ultra (253B) -- and performs competitively with state-of-the-art reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 while offering superior inference throughput and memory efficiency. In this report, we discuss the training procedure for these models, which entails using neural architecture search from Llama 3 models for accelerated inference, knowledge distillation, and continued pretraining, followed by a reasoning-focused post-training stage consisting of two main parts: supervised fine-tuning and large scale reinforcement learning. Llama-Nemotron models are the first open-source models to support a dynamic reasoning toggle, allowing users to switch between standard chat and reasoning modes during inference. To further support open research and facilitate model development, we provide the following resources: 1. We release the Llama-Nemotron reasoning models -- LN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra -- under the commercially permissive NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement. 2. We release the complete post-training dataset: Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset. 3. We also release our training codebases: NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, and Megatron-LM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling Realizable Students from Unrealizable Teachers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09546v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study policy distillation under privileged information, where a student policy with only partial observations must learn from a teacher with full-state access. A key challenge is information asymmetry: the student cannot directly access the teacher's state space, leading to distributional shifts and policy degradation. Existing approaches either modify the teacher to produce realizable but sub-optimal demonstrations or rely on the student to explore missing information independently, both of which are inefficient. Our key insight is that the student should strategically interact with the teacher --querying only when necessary and resetting from recovery states --to stay on a recoverable path within its own observation space. We introduce two methods: (i) an imitation learning approach that adaptively determines when the student should query the teacher for corrections, and (ii) a reinforcement learning approach that selects where to initialize training for efficient exploration. We validate our methods in both simulated and real-world robotic tasks, demonstrating significant improvements over standard teacher-student baselines in training efficiency and final performance.

| **[Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Simulation for Environmental Policy Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12777v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate policy development faces significant challenges due to deep uncertainty, complex system dynamics, and competing stakeholder interests. Climate simulation methods, such as Earth System Models, have become valuable tools for policy exploration. However, their typical use is for evaluating potential polices, rather than directly synthesizing them. The problem can be inverted to optimize for policy pathways, but the traditional optimization approaches often struggle with non-linear dynamics, heterogeneous agents, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification. We propose a framework for augmenting climate simulations with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address these limitations. We identify key challenges at the interface between climate simulations and the application of MARL in the context of policy synthesis, including reward definition, scalability with increasing agents and state spaces, uncertainty propagation across linked systems, and solution validation. Additionally, we discuss challenges in making MARL-derived solutions interpretable and useful for policy-makers. Our framework provides a foundation for more sophisticated climate policy exploration while acknowledging important limitations and areas for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in AAMAS'25 Blue Sky Ideas Track</p></details> |

Learning from heterogeneous data is one of the fundamental challenges in offline RL. Traditional methods focus on learning an optimal policy for all individuals with pre-collected data from a single episode or homogeneous batch episodes, and thus, may result in a suboptimal policy for a heterogeneous population. In this paper, we propose an individualized offline policy optimization framework for heterogeneous time-stationary Markov decision processes (MDPs). The proposed heterogeneous model with individual latent variables enables us to efficiently estimate the individual Q-functions, and our Penalized Pessimistic Personalized Policy Learning (P4L) algorithm guarantees a fast rate on the average regret under a weak partial coverage assumption on behavior policies. In addition, our simulation studies and a real data application demonstrate the superior numerical performance of the proposed method compared with existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preserving Plasticity in Continual Learning with Adaptive Linearity Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09486v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loss of plasticity in deep neural networks is the gradual reduction in a model's capacity to incrementally learn and has been identified as a key obstacle to learning in non-stationary problem settings. Recent work has shown that deep linear networks tend to be resilient towards loss of plasticity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Adaptive Linearization (AdaLin), a general approach that dynamically adapts each neuron's activation function to mitigate plasticity loss. Unlike prior methods that rely on regularization or periodic resets, AdaLin equips every neuron with a learnable parameter and a gating mechanism that injects linearity into the activation function based on its gradient flow. This adaptive modulation ensures sufficient gradient signal and sustains continual learning without introducing additional hyperparameters or requiring explicit task boundaries. When used with conventional activation functions like ReLU, Tanh, and GeLU, we demonstrate that AdaLin can significantly improve performance on standard benchmarks, including Random Label and Permuted MNIST, Random Label and Shuffled CIFAR-10, and Class-Split CIFAR-100. Furthermore, its efficacy is shown in more complex scenarios, such as class-incremental learning on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-18 backbone, and in mitigating plasticity loss in off-policy reinforcement learning agents. We perform a systematic set of ablations that show that neuron-level adaptation is crucial for good performance and analyze a number of metrics in the network that might be correlated to loss of plasticity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 4th Conference on Lifelong Learning Agents (CoLLAs), 2025</p></details> |

The core challenge is designing interactions to optimally balance two competing goals: charging of the battery optimally using the qubit in hand, and acquiring more information by qubit to improve energy harvesting in subsequent rounds. Here, we leverage exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning to develop adaptive strategies achieving energy dissipation that scales only poly-logarithmically in $N$.

This leads to new State-of-the-Art performance on the recent MMAU benchmark. Omni-R1 achieves the highest accuracies on the sounds, music, speech, and overall average categories, both on the Test-mini and Test-full splits. To understand the performance improvement, we tested models both with and without audio and found that much of the performance improvement from GRPO could be attributed to better text-based reasoning. We also made a surprising discovery that fine-tuning without audio on a text-only dataset was effective at improving the audio-based performance.</p></details> |  |

Quantum-Train (QT), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that leverages quantum neural networks (QNNs) to generate trainable parameters exclusively during training, eliminating the need for quantum hardware at inference time. Building on QT's success across multiple domains, including image classification, reinforcement learning, flood prediction, and large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, we introduce Quantum Parameter Adaptation (QPA) for efficient typhoon forecasting model learning. Integrated with an Attention-based Multi-ConvGRU model, QPA enables parameter-efficient training while maintaining predictive accuracy. This work represents the first application of quantum machine learning (QML) to large-scale typhoon trajectory prediction, offering a scalable and energy-efficient approach to climate modeling. Our results demonstrate that QPA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving performance, making high-performance forecasting more accessible and sustainable through hybrid quantum-classical learning.</p></details> |  |

While Probabilistic Logic Shields (PLS) has been a powerful proposal to enforce safety in single-agent RL, their generalizability to multi-agent settings remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by conducting extensive analyses of PLS within decentralized, multi-agent environments, and in doing so, propose Shielded Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (SMARL) as a general framework for steering MARL towards norm-compliant outcomes. Our key contributions are: (1) a novel Probabilistic Logic Temporal Difference (PLTD) update for shielded, independent Q-learning, which incorporates probabilistic constraints directly into the value update process; (2) a probabilistic logic policy gradient method for shielded PPO with formal safety guarantees for MARL; and (3) comprehensive evaluation across symmetric and asymmetrically shielded $n$-player game-theoretic benchmarks, demonstrating fewer constraint violations and significantly better cooperation under normative constraints. These results position SMARL as an effective mechanism for equilibrium selection, paving the way toward safer, socially aligned multi-agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 16 figures, Earlier title: "Analyzing Probabilistic Logic Driven Safety in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" (changed for specificity and clarity)</p></details> |

Quantum architecture search (QAS) automates this design process, with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as a promising approach. Yet, RL-based QAS methods encounter significant scalability issues, as computational and training costs grow rapidly with the number of qubits, circuit depth, and noise, severely impacting performance. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textit{TensorRL-QAS}$, a scalable framework that combines tensor network (TN) methods with RL for designing quantum circuits. By warm-starting the architecture search with a matrix product state approximation of the target solution, TensorRL-QAS effectively narrows the search space to physically meaningful circuits, accelerating convergence to the desired solution. Tested on several quantum chemistry problems of up to 12-qubit, TensorRL-QAS achieves up to a 10-fold reduction in CNOT count and circuit depth compared to baseline methods, while maintaining or surpassing chemical accuracy. It reduces function evaluations by up to 100-fold, accelerates training episodes by up to $98\%$, and achieves up to $50\%$ success probability for 10-qubit systems-far exceeding the $<1\%$ rates of baseline approaches. Robustness and versatility are demonstrated both in the noiseless and noisy scenarios, where we report a simulation of up to 8-qubit. These advancements establish TensorRL-QAS as a promising candidate for a scalable and efficient quantum circuit discovery protocol on near-term quantum hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code will be available soon!

However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods employ static, pre-inference retrieval strategies, making them inadequate for complex tasks involving ambiguous, multi-step, or evolving information needs. Recent advances in test-time scaling techniques have demonstrated significant potential in enabling LLMs to dynamically interact with external tools, motivating the shift toward adaptive inference-time retrieval. Inspired by Information Foraging Theory (IFT), we propose InForage, a reinforcement learning framework that formalizes retrieval-augmented reasoning as a dynamic information-seeking process. Unlike existing approaches, InForage explicitly rewards intermediate retrieval quality, encouraging LLMs to iteratively gather and integrate information through adaptive search behaviors. To facilitate training, we construct a human-guided dataset capturing iterative search and reasoning trajectories for complex, real-world web tasks. Extensive evaluations across general question answering, multi-hop reasoning tasks, and a newly developed real-time web QA dataset demonstrate InForage's superior performance over baseline methods. These results highlight InForage's effectiveness in building robust, adaptive, and efficient reasoning agents.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Despite its success in language models, its application in multi-modal domains, particularly in graphic user interface (GUI) agent tasks, remains under-explored. To address this issue, we propose UI-R1, the first framework to explore how rule-based RL can enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI action prediction tasks. Specifically, UI-R1 introduces a novel rule-based action reward, enabling model optimization via policy-based algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). For efficient training, we curate a small yet high-quality dataset of 136 challenging tasks, encompassing five common action types on mobile devices. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed UI-R1-3B achieves significant improvements over the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks, with average accuracy gains of 22.1% on ScreenSpot, 6.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, and 12.7% on ANDROIDCONTROL. Furthermore, UI-R1-3B delivers competitive performance compared to larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B) trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on 76K samples. We additionally develop an optimized version, UI-R1-E-3B, which significantly improves both grounding efficiency and accuracy. These results underscore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning to advance GUI understanding and control, paving the way for future research in this domain.

This paper leverages the UFM to provide qualitative insights into neural multivariate regression, a critical task in imitation learning, robotics, and reinforcement learning. Specifically, we address two key questions: (1) How do multi-task models compare to multiple single-task models in terms of training performance? (2) Can whitening and normalizing regression targets improve training performance? The UFM theory predicts that multi-task models achieve strictly smaller training MSE than multiple single-task models when the same or stronger regularization is applied to the latter, and our empirical results confirm these findings. Regarding whitening and normalizing regression targets, the UFM theory predicts that they reduce training MSE when the average variance across the target dimensions is less than one, and our empirical results once again confirm these findings. These findings highlight the UFM as a powerful framework for deriving actionable insights into DNN design and data pre-processing strategies.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |

Efficient path planners are therefore required. This paper presents a drone path planner trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL) on an abstract simulation that uses object detections and uncertain prior knowledge. The RL agent controls the flight direction and can terminate the flight. By using the agent in combination with the drone's flight controller and a detection network to process camera images, it is possible to evaluate the performance of the agent on real-world data. In simulation, the agent yielded on average a 78% shorter flight path compared to a full coverage planner, at the cost of a 14% lower recall. On real-world data, the agent showed a 72% shorter flight path compared to a full coverage planner, however, at the cost of a 25% lower recall. The lower performance on real-world data was attributed to the real-world object distribution and the lower accuracy of prior knowledge, and shows potential for improvement. Overall, we concluded that for applications where it is not crucial to find all objects, such as weed detection, the learned-based path planner is suitable and efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Novel Approaches for Precision Agriculture and Forestry with Autonomous Robots IEEE ICRA Workshop - 2025</p></details> |

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks.

| **[Seeing Beyond the Scene: Enhancing Vision-Language Models with Interactional Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09118v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional scene graphs primarily focus on spatial relationships, limiting vision-language models' (VLMs) ability to reason about complex interactions in visual scenes. This paper addresses two key challenges: (1) conventional detection-to-construction methods produce unfocused, contextually irrelevant relationship sets, and (2) existing approaches fail to form persistent memories for generalizing interaction reasoning to new scenes. We propose Interaction-augmented Scene Graph Reasoning (ISGR), a framework that enhances VLMs' interactional reasoning through three complementary components. First, our dual-stream graph constructor combines SAM-powered spatial relation extraction with interaction-aware captioning to generate functionally salient scene graphs with spatial grounding. Second, we employ targeted interaction queries to activate VLMs' latent knowledge of object functionalities, converting passive recognition into active reasoning about how objects work together. Finally, we introduce a lone-term memory reinforcement learning strategy with a specialized interaction-focused reward function that transforms transient patterns into long-term reasoning heuristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods on interaction-heavy reasoning benchmarks, with particularly strong improvements on complex scene understanding tasks.

| **[Beyond the Known: Decision Making with Counterfactual Reasoning Decision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09114v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformers (DT) play a crucial role in modern reinforcement learning, leveraging offline datasets to achieve impressive results across various domains. However, DT requires high-quality, comprehensive data to perform optimally. In real-world applications, the lack of training data and the scarcity of optimal behaviours make training on offline datasets challenging, as suboptimal data can hinder performance. To address this, we propose the Counterfactual Reasoning Decision Transformer (CRDT), a novel framework inspired by counterfactual reasoning. CRDT enhances DT ability to reason beyond known data by generating and utilizing counterfactual experiences, enabling improved decision-making in unseen scenarios. Experiments across Atari and D4RL benchmarks, including scenarios with limited data and altered dynamics, demonstrate that CRDT outperforms conventional DT approaches. Additionally, reasoning counterfactually allows the DT agent to obtain stitching abilities, combining suboptimal trajectories, without architectural modifications. These results highlight the potential of counterfactual reasoning to enhance reinforcement learning agents' performance and generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, the uniqueness of patients' muscle loss is often overlooked. Leveraging reinforcement learning and a biologically accurate musculoskeletal model in simulation, we propose a customized wearable robotic controller that is able to address specific muscle deficits and to provide compensation for hand-object manipulation tasks. Video data of a same subject performing human grasping tasks is used to train a manipulation model through learning from demonstration. This manipulation model is subsequently fine-tuned to perform object-specific interaction tasks. The muscle forces in the musculoskeletal manipulation model are then weakened to simulate neurological motor impairments, which are later compensated by the actuation of a virtual wearable robotics glove. Results shows that integrating the virtual wearable robotic glove provides shared assistance to support the hand manipulator with weakened muscle forces. The learned exoglove controller achieved an average of 90.5\% of the original manipulation proficiency.</p></details> |  |

By integrating RL with LLMs' generative power, the method eliminates dependency on annotated data or auxiliary models. Experiments reveal RL-enhanced LLMs achieve industry-viable accuracy and superior cross-domain generalization, offering a scalable solution for reliability optimization in Chinese NLP applications. This breakthrough facilitates LLM deployment in practical Chinese text correction scenarios while establishing a new paradigm for self-improving language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning: A Case Study on Audio Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11197v4)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to greatly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), and RL-based approaches have been progressively applied to visual multimodal tasks. However, the audio modality has largely been overlooked in these developments. Thus, we conduct a series of RL explorations in audio understanding and reasoning, specifically focusing on the audio question answering (AQA) task. We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct, and our experiments demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the MMAU Test-mini benchmark, achieving an accuracy rate of 64.5%. The main findings in this technical report are as follows: 1) The GRPO algorithm can be effectively applied to large audio language models (LALMs), even when the model has only 8.2B parameters; 2) With only 38k post-training samples, RL significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning (SFT), indicating that RL-based approaches can be effective without large datasets; 3) The explicit reasoning process has not shown significant benefits for AQA tasks, and how to efficiently utilize deep thinking remains an open question for further research; 4) LALMs still lag far behind humans auditory-language reasoning, suggesting that the RL-based approaches warrant further exploration.

| **[DRA-GRPO: Exploring Diversity-Aware Reward Adjustment for R1-Zero-Like Training of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09655v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning for language model post-training, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have shown promise in low-resource settings. However, GRPO typically relies on solution-level and scalar reward signals that fail to capture the semantic diversity among sampled completions. This leads to what we identify as a diversity-quality inconsistency, where distinct reasoning paths may receive indistinguishable rewards. To address this limitation, we propose $\textit{Diversity-aware Reward Adjustment}$ (DRA), a method that explicitly incorporates semantic diversity into the reward computation. DRA uses Submodular Mutual Information (SMI) to downweight redundant completions and amplify rewards for diverse ones. This encourages better exploration during learning, while maintaining stable exploitation of high-quality samples. Our method integrates seamlessly with both GRPO and its variant DR.~GRPO, resulting in $\textit{DRA-GRPO}$ and $\textit{DGA-DR.~GRPO}$. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks and find that it outperforms recent strong baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 58.2%, using only 7,000 fine-tuning samples and a total training cost of approximately $55. The code is available at https://github.com/xiwenc1/DRA-GRPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Single-Turn: A Survey on Multi-Turn Interactions with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04717v4)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized their ability to handle single-turn tasks, yet real-world applications demand sophisticated multi-turn interactions. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in evaluating and enhancing multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Focusing on task-specific scenarios, from instruction following in diverse domains such as math and coding to complex conversational engagements in roleplay, healthcare, education, and even adversarial jailbreak settings, we systematically examine the challenges of maintaining context, coherence, fairness, and responsiveness over prolonged dialogues. The paper organizes current benchmarks and datasets into coherent categories that reflect the evolving landscape of multi-turn dialogue evaluation. In addition, we review a range of enhancement methodologies under multi-turn settings, including model-centric strategies (contextual learning, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and new architectures), external integration approaches (memory-augmented, retrieval-based methods, and knowledge graph), and agent-based techniques for collaborative interactions. Finally, we discuss open challenges and propose future directions for research to further advance the robustness and effectiveness of multi-turn interactions in LLMs. Related resources and papers are available at https://github.com/yubol-cmu/Awesome-Multi-Turn-LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Making Small Language Models Efficient Reasoners: Intervention, Supervision, Reinforcement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07961v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research enhances language model reasoning by scaling test-time compute via longer chain-of-thought traces. This often improves accuracy but also introduces redundancy and high computational cost, especially for small language models distilled with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we propose new algorithms to improve token-efficient reasoning with small-scale models by effectively trading off accuracy and computation. We first show that the post-SFT model fails to determine the optimal stopping point of the reasoning process, resulting in verbose and repetitive outputs. Verbosity also significantly varies across wrong vs correct responses. To address these issues, we propose two solutions: (1) Temperature scaling (TS) to control the stopping point for the thinking phase and thereby trace length, and (2) TLDR: a length-regularized reinforcement learning method based on GRPO that facilitates multi-level trace length control (e.g. short, medium, long reasoning). Experiments on four reasoning benchmarks, MATH500, AMC, AIME24 and OlympiadBench, demonstrate that TS is highly effective compared to s1's budget forcing approach and TLDR significantly improves token efficiency by about 50% with minimal to no accuracy loss over the SFT baseline. Moreover, TLDR also facilitates flexible control over the response length, offering a practical and effective solution for token-efficient reasoning in small models. Ultimately, our work reveals the importance of stopping time control, highlights shortcomings of pure SFT, and provides effective algorithmic recipes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monte Carlo Beam Search for Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning in Continuous Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09029v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Actor-critic methods, like Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), depend on basic noise-based exploration, which can result in less than optimal policy convergence. In this study, we introduce Monte Carlo Beam Search (MCBS), a new hybrid method that combines beam search and Monte Carlo rollouts with TD3 to improve exploration and action selection. MCBS produces several candidate actions around the policy's output and assesses them through short-horizon rollouts, enabling the agent to make better-informed choices. We test MCBS across various continuous-control benchmarks, including HalfCheetah-v4, Walker2d-v5, and Swimmer-v5, showing enhanced sample efficiency and performance compared to standard TD3 and other baseline methods like SAC, PPO, and A2C. Our findings emphasize MCBS's capability to enhance policy learning through structured look-ahead search while ensuring computational efficiency. Additionally, we offer a detailed analysis of crucial hyperparameters, such as beam width and rollout depth, and explore adaptive strategies to optimize MCBS for complex control tasks. Our method shows a higher convergence rate across different environments compared to TD3, SAC, PPO, and A2C. For instance, we achieved 90% of the maximum achievable reward within around 200 thousand timesteps compared to 400 thousand timesteps for the second-best method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Meta Prompt Engineering for Alignment with the Theory of Mind](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09024v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a method of meta-prompting that jointly produces fluent text for complex tasks while optimizing the similarity of neural states between a human's mental expectation and a Large Language Model's (LLM) neural processing. A technique of agentic reinforcement learning is applied, in which an LLM as a Judge (LLMaaJ) teaches another LLM, through in-context learning, how to produce content by interpreting the intended and unintended generated text traits. To measure human mental beliefs around content production, users modify long form AI-generated text articles before publication at the US Open 2024 tennis Grand Slam. Now, an LLMaaJ can solve the Theory of Mind (ToM) alignment problem by anticipating and including human edits within the creation of text from an LLM. Throughout experimentation and by interpreting the results of a live production system, the expectations of human content reviewers had 100% of alignment with AI 53.8% of the time with an average iteration count of 4.38. The geometric interpretation of content traits such as factualness, novelty, repetitiveness, and relevancy over a Hilbert vector space combines spatial volume (all trait importance) with vertices alignment (individual trait relevance) enabled the LLMaaJ to optimize on Human ToM. This resulted in an increase in content quality by extending the coverage of tennis action. Our work that was deployed at the US Open 2024 has been used across other live events within sports and entertainment.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

In certain cases, multi-stage cascading failures can occur. However, existing cascading-failure-mitigation strategies are usually single-stage-based, overlooking the complexity of the multi-stage scenario. This paper treats the multi-stage cascading failure problem as a reinforcement learning task and develops a simulation environment. The reinforcement learning agent is then trained via the deterministic policy gradient algorithm to achieve continuous actions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted and presented at ICLR 2025 in Singapore, Apr. 28, 2025</p></details> |

Our approach integrates policy optimization with familiarity autoencoders within an end-to-end continual learning system. This system can recognize and learn new tasks or environments while preserving knowledge from earlier experiences and can selectively retrieve relevant knowledge when re-encountering a known environment.

| **[Learning to Be Cautious](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15907v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key challenge in the field of reinforcement learning is to develop agents that behave cautiously in novel situations. It is generally impossible to anticipate all situations that an autonomous system may face or what behavior would best avoid bad outcomes. An agent that can learn to be cautious would overcome this challenge by discovering for itself when and how to behave cautiously. In contrast, current approaches typically embed task-specific safety information or explicit cautious behaviors into the system, which is error-prone and imposes extra burdens on practitioners. In this paper, we present both a sequence of tasks where cautious behavior becomes increasingly non-obvious, as well as an algorithm to demonstrate that it is possible for a system to learn to be cautious. The essential features of our algorithm are that it characterizes reward function uncertainty without task-specific safety information and uses this uncertainty to construct a robust policy. Specifically, we construct robust policies with a k-of-N counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) subroutine given learned reward function uncertainty represented by a neural network ensemble. These policies exhibit caution in each of our tasks without any task-specific safety tuning.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Enhancing Aerial Combat Tactics through Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08995v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework for analyzing simulated air combat scenarios involving heterogeneous agents. The objective is to identify effective Courses of Action that lead to mission success within preset simulations, thereby enabling the exploration of real-world defense scenarios at low cost and in a safe-to-fail setting. Applying deep Reinforcement Learning in this context poses specific challenges, such as complex flight dynamics, the exponential size of the state and action spaces in multi-agent systems, and the capability to integrate real-time control of individual units with look-ahead planning. To address these challenges, the decision-making process is split into two levels of abstraction: low-level policies control individual units, while a high-level commander policy issues macro commands aligned with the overall mission targets. This hierarchical structure facilitates the training process by exploiting policy symmetries of individual agents and by separating control from command tasks. The low-level policies are trained for individual combat control in a curriculum of increasing complexity. The high-level commander is then trained on mission targets given pre-trained control policies. The empirical validation confirms the advantages of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as journal chapter in Deep Learning Applications, Vol. 1, by Taylor & Francis</p></details> |
| **[Generalization in Monitored Markov Decision Processes (Mon-MDPs)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08988v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) typically models the interaction between the agent and environment as a Markov decision process (MDP), where the rewards that guide the agent's behavior are always observable. However, in many real-world scenarios, rewards are not always observable, which can be modeled as a monitored Markov decision process (Mon-MDP). Prior work on Mon-MDPs have been limited to simple, tabular cases, restricting their applicability to real-world problems. This work explores Mon-MDPs using function approximation (FA) and investigates the challenges involved. We show that combining function approximation with a learned reward model enables agents to generalize from monitored states with observable rewards, to unmonitored environment states with unobservable rewards. Therefore, we demonstrate that such generalization with a reward model achieves near-optimal policies in environments formally defined as unsolvable. However, we identify a critical limitation of such function approximation, where agents incorrectly extrapolate rewards due to overgeneralization, resulting in undesirable behaviors. To mitigate overgeneralization, we propose a cautious police optimization method leveraging reward uncertainty. This work serves as a step towards bridging this gap between Mon-MDP theory and real-world applications.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Adaptive Entanglement Generation for Quantum Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08958v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entanglement generation in long-distance quantum networks is a difficult process due to resource limitations and the probabilistic nature of entanglement swapping. To maximize success probability, existing quantum routing algorithms employ computationally expensive solutions (e.g., linear programming) to determine which links to entangle and use for end-to-end entanglement generation. Such optimization methods, however, cannot meet the delay requirements of real-world quantum networks, necessitating swift yet efficient real-time optimization models. In this paper, we propose reinforcement learning (RL)-based models to determine which links to entangle and proactively swap to meet connection requests. We show that the proposed RL-based approach is 20x faster compared to linear programming. Moreover, we show that one can take advantage of the longevity of entanglements to (i) cache entangled links for future use and (ii) proactively swap entanglement on high-demand path segments, thereby increasing the likelihood of request success. Through comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate that caching unused entanglements leads to a 10-15% improvement in the performance of state-of-the-art quantum routing algorithms. Complementing caching with proactive entanglement swapping further enhances the request success rate by up to 52.55%.</p></details> |  |

Artificial bacterial flagella (ABFs) have emerged as potential tools for this task by navigating through the circulatory system with the help of external magnetic fields. While their swimming characteristics are well understood in simple settings, their controlled navigation through realistic capillary networks remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of blood flow and the high computational cost of detailed simulations. We address this challenge by conducting numerical simulations of ABFs in retinal capillaries, propelled by an external magnetic field. The simulations are based on a validated blood model that predicts the dynamics of individual red blood cells and their hydrodynamic interactions with ABFs. The magnetic field follows a control policy that brings the ABF to a prescribed target. The control policy is learned with an actor-critic, off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm coupled with a reduced-order model of the system. We show that the same policy robustly guides the ABF to a prescribed target in both the reduced-order model and the fine-grained blood simulations. This approach is suitable for designing robust control policies for personalized medicine at moderate computational cost.</p></details> |  |

In its current implementation, DIDP guides the search using user-defined dual bounds. Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly being applied to combinatorial optimization problems and shares several key structures with DP, being represented by the Bellman equation and state-based transition systems. We propose using reinforcement learning to obtain a heuristic function to guide the search in DIDP. We develop two RL-based guidance approaches: value-based guidance using Deep Q-Networks and policy-based guidance using Proximal Policy Optimization. Our experiments indicate that RL-based guidance significantly outperforms standard DIDP and problem-specific greedy heuristics with the same number of node expansions. Further, despite longer node evaluation times, RL guidance achieves better run-time performance than standard DIDP on three of four benchmark domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures, to be published in CPAIOR 2025 (https://sites.google.com/view/cpaior2025)</p></details> |

Among QML approaches, variational quantum circuits (VQCs), also known as quantum neural networks (QNNs), have shown promise both empirically and theoretically. However, their broader adoption is hindered by reliance on quantum hardware during inference. Hardware imperfections and limited access to quantum devices pose practical challenges. To address this, the Quantum-Train (QT) framework leverages the exponential scaling of quantum amplitudes to generate classical neural network parameters, enabling inference without quantum hardware and achieving significant parameter compression. Yet, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for such quantum-enhanced neural programmers remains non-trivial and often requires expertise in quantum information science. In this paper, we propose an automated solution using differentiable optimization. Our method jointly optimizes both conventional circuit parameters and architectural parameters in an end-to-end manner via automatic differentiation. We evaluate the proposed framework on classification, time-series prediction, and reinforcement learning tasks. Simulation results show that our method matches or outperforms manually designed QNN architectures. This work offers a scalable and automated pathway for designing QNNs that can generate classical neural network parameters across diverse applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep reinforcement learning-based longitudinal control strategy for automated vehicles at signalised intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08896v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing an autonomous vehicle control strategy for signalised intersections (SI) is one of the challenging tasks due to its inherently complex decision-making process. This study proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based longitudinal vehicle control strategy at SI. A comprehensive reward function has been formulated with a particular focus on (i) distance headway-based efficiency reward, (ii) decision-making criteria during amber light, and (iii) asymmetric acceleration/ deceleration response, along with the traditional safety and comfort criteria. This reward function has been incorporated with two popular DRL algorithms, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Soft-Actor Critic (SAC), which can handle the continuous action space of acceleration/deceleration. The proposed models have been trained on the combination of real-world leader vehicle (LV) trajectories and simulated trajectories generated using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. The overall performance of the proposed models has been tested using Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) plots and compared with the real-world trajectory data. The results show that the RL models successfully maintain lower distance headway (i.e., higher efficiency) and jerk compared to human-driven vehicles without compromising safety. Further, to assess the robustness of the proposed models, we evaluated the model performance on diverse safety-critical scenarios, in terms of car-following and traffic signal compliance. Both DDPG and SAC models successfully handled the critical scenarios, while the DDPG model showed smoother action profiles compared to the SAC model. Overall, the results confirm that DRL-based longitudinal vehicle control strategy at SI can help to improve traffic safety, efficiency, and comfort.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Molecular Design with Steerable and Granular Synthesizability Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08774v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizability in small molecule generative design remains a bottleneck. Existing works that do consider synthesizability can output predicted synthesis routes for generated molecules. However, there has been minimal attention in addressing the ease of synthesis and enabling flexibility to incorporate desired reaction constraints. In this work, we propose a small molecule generative design framework that enables steerable and granular synthesizability control. Generated molecules satisfy arbitrary multi-parameter optimization objectives with predicted synthesis routes containing pre-defined allowed reactions, while optionally avoiding others. One can also enforce that all reactions belong to a pre-defined set. We show the capability to mix-and-match these reaction constraints across the most common medicinal chemistry transformations. Next, we show how our framework can be used to valorize industrial byproducts towards de novo optimized molecules. Going further, we demonstrate how granular control over synthesizability constraints can loosely mimic virtual screening of ultra-large make-on-demand libraries. Using only a single GPU, we generate and dock 15k molecules to identify promising candidates in Freedom 4.0 constituting 142B make-on-demand molecules (assessing only 0.00001% of the library). Generated molecules satisfying the reaction constraints have > 90% exact match rate. Lastly, we benchmark our framework against recent synthesizability-constrained generative models and demonstrate the highest sample efficiency even when imposing the additional constraint that all molecules must be synthesizable from a single reaction type. The main theme is demonstrating that a pre-trained generalist molecular generative model can be incentivized to generate property-optimized small molecules under challenging synthesizability constraints through reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant progress, existing RL approaches face challenges such as diminishing reward signals and inefficient exploration in vast combinatorial action spaces, leading to inefficiency. In this paper, we propose Preference Optimization, a novel method that transforms quantitative reward signals into qualitative preference signals via statistical comparison modeling, emphasizing the superiority among sampled solutions. Methodologically, by reparameterizing the reward function in terms of policy and utilizing preference models, we formulate an entropy-regularized RL objective that aligns the policy directly with preferences while avoiding intractable computations. Furthermore, we integrate local search techniques into the fine-tuning rather than post-processing to generate high-quality preference pairs, helping the policy escape local optima. Empirical results on various benchmarks, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and the Flexible Flow Shop Problem (FFSP), demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing RL algorithms, achieving superior convergence efficiency and solution quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

While prior work has integrated differential privacy (DP) with alignment techniques, their performance remains limited. In this paper, we propose novel algorithms for privacy-preserving alignment and rigorously analyze their effectiveness across varying privacy budgets and models. Our framework can be deployed on two celebrated alignment techniques, namely direct preference optimization (DPO) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Through systematic experiments on large-scale language models, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, one of our algorithms, DP-AdamW, combined with DPO, surpasses existing methods, improving alignment quality by up to 15% under moderate privacy budgets ({\epsilon}=2-5). We further investigate the interplay between privacy guarantees, alignment efficacy, and computational demands, providing practical guidelines for optimizing these trade-offs.</p></details> |  |

The data visualization tools and statistical metrics are the indicators for the comparisons and show some obvious trends and patterns that can guide decision-making in inventory management. These tools enable managers to not only track the performance of different algorithms in real-time but also to drill down into specific data points to understand the underlying causes of inventory fluctuations. This level of detail is crucial for pinpointing inefficiencies and areas for improvement within the supply chain.</p></details> |  |

However, the sample efficiency of RL is crucial, and to improve it, we combine a model-based RL algorithm with our published method that turns Koopman (e)NMPCs into automatically differentiable policies. We apply our approach to an eNMPC case study of a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) model from the literature. The approach outperforms benchmark methods, i.e., data-driven eNMPCs using models based on system identification without further RL tuning of the resulting policy, and neural network controllers trained with model-based RL, by achieving superior control performance and higher sample efficiency. Furthermore, utilizing partial prior knowledge about the system dynamics via physics-informed learning further increases sample efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Credit Assignment and Efficient Exploration based on Influence Scope in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08630v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training cooperative agents in sparse-reward scenarios poses significant challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Without clear feedback on actions at each step in sparse-reward setting, previous methods struggle with precise credit assignment among agents and effective exploration. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to deal with both credit assignment and exploration problems in reward-sparse domains. Accordingly, we propose an algorithm that calculates the Influence Scope of Agents (ISA) on states by taking specific value of the dimensions/attributes of states that can be influenced by individual agents. The mutual dependence between agents' actions and state attributes are then used to calculate the credit assignment and to delimit the exploration space for each individual agent. We then evaluate ISA in a variety of sparse-reward multi-agent scenarios. The results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Based on a popular maximum entropy criteria, our approach iteratively finds a weight improvement step and proposes a method to find an appropriate step size that ensures learned cost function features remain similar to the demonstrated trajectory features. In contrast to similar approaches, our algorithm can individually tune the effectiveness of each observation for the partition function and does not need a large sample set, enabling faster learning. We generate sample trajectories by solving an optimal control problem instead of random sampling, leading to more informative trajectories. The performance of our method is compared to two state of the art algorithms to demonstrate its benefits in several simulated environments.</p></details> |  |

A significant hurdle is the current lack of standardized infrastructure, which hinders integrating diverse tools, generating rich interaction data, and training robust agents effectively. To address these gaps, we introduce OpenThinkIMG, the first open-source, comprehensive end-to-end framework for tool-augmented LVLMs. It features standardized vision tool interfaces, scalable trajectory generation for policy initialization, and a flexible training environment. Furthermore, considering supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on static demonstrations offers limited policy generalization for dynamic tool invocation, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework V-ToolRL to train LVLMs to learn adaptive policies for invoking external vision tools. V-ToolRL enables LVLMs to autonomously discover optimal tool-usage strategies by directly optimizing for task success using feedback from tool interactions. We empirically validate V-ToolRL on challenging chart reasoning tasks. Our RL-trained agent, built upon a Qwen2-VL-2B, significantly outperforms its SFT-initialized counterpart (+28.83 points) and surpasses established supervised tool-learning baselines like Taco and CogCom by an average of +12.7 points. Notably, it also surpasses prominent closed-source models like GPT-4.1 by +8.68 accuracy points. We hope OpenThinkIMG can serve as a foundational framework for advancing dynamic, tool-augmented visual reasoning, helping the community develop AI agents that can genuinely "think with images".</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, despite its potential, traditional PbRL methods are often constrained by the indistinguishability of segments, which impedes the learning process. In this paper, we introduce Skill-Enhanced Preference Optimization Algorithm (S-EPOA), which addresses the segment indistinguishability issue by integrating skill mechanisms into the preference learning framework. Specifically, we first conduct the unsupervised pretraining to learn useful skills. Then, we propose a novel query selection mechanism to balance the information gain and distinguishability over the learned skill space. Experimental results on a range of tasks, including robotic manipulation and locomotion, demonstrate that S-EPOA significantly outperforms conventional PbRL methods in terms of both robustness and learning efficiency. The results highlight the effectiveness of skill-driven learning in overcoming the challenges posed by segment indistinguishability.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 |

However, a key challenge in such approaches lies in selecting an appropriate masking strategy. Previous studies have explored predefined masking techniques, including random and tube-based masking, as well as approaches that leverage key motion priors, optical flow and semantic cues from externally pre-trained models. In this work, we introduce a novel and generalizable Trajectory-Aware Adaptive Token Sampler (TATS), which models the motion dynamics of tokens and can be seamlessly integrated into the masked autoencoder (MAE) framework to select motion-centric tokens in videos. Additionally, we propose a unified training strategy that enables joint optimization of both MAE and TATS from scratch using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We show that our model allows for aggressive masking without compromising performance on the downstream task of action recognition while also ensuring that the pre-training remains memory efficient. Extensive experiments of the proposed approach across four benchmarks, including Something-Something v2, Kinetics-400, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, generalization, and efficiency of our work compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive textual data have recently demonstrated outstanding performance in general tasks, introducing new research directions for opponent modeling. Some studies primarily focus on directly using LLMs to generate decisions based on the elaborate prompt context that incorporates opponent descriptions, while these approaches are limited to scenarios where LLMs possess adequate domain expertise. To address that, we introduce a two-stage Strategy-Augmented Planning (SAP) framework that significantly enhances the opponent exploitation capabilities of LLM-based agents by utilizing a critical component, the Strategy Evaluation Network (SEN). Specifically, in the offline stage, we construct an explicit strategy space and subsequently collect strategy-outcome pair data for training the SEN network. During the online phase, SAP dynamically recognizes the opponent's strategies and greedily exploits them by searching best response strategy on the well-trained SEN, finally translating strategy to a course of actions by carefully designed prompts. Experimental results show that SAP exhibits robust generalization capabilities, allowing it to perform effectively not only against previously encountered opponent strategies but also against novel, unseen strategies. In the MicroRTS environment, SAP achieves a 85.35\% performance improvement over baseline methods and matches the competitiveness of reinforcement learning approaches against state-of-the-art (SOTA) rule-based AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

| **[Parameter Estimation using Reinforcement Learning Causal Curiosity: Limits and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08453v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal understanding is important in many disciplines of science and engineering, where we seek to understand how different factors in the system causally affect an experiment or situation and pave a pathway towards creating effective or optimising existing models. Examples of use cases are autonomous exploration and modelling of unknown environments or assessing key variables in optimising large complex systems. In this paper, we analyse a Reinforcement Learning approach called Causal Curiosity, which aims to estimate as accurately and efficiently as possible, without directly measuring them, the value of factors that causally determine the dynamics of a system. Whilst the idea presents a pathway forward, measurement accuracy is the foundation of methodology effectiveness. Focusing on the current causal curiosity's robotic manipulator, we present for the first time a measurement accuracy analysis of the future potentials and current limitations of this technique and an analysis of its sensitivity and confounding factor disentanglement capability - crucial for causal analysis. As a result of our work, we promote proposals for an improved and efficient design of Causal Curiosity methods to be applied to real-world complex scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 10 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

However, organizing UAVs to form multi-hop networks in large-scale dynamic environments presents significant challenges, including limitations in algorithmic scalability and the vast exploration space required for coordinated decision-making. To address these issues, we propose MRLMN, a novel framework that integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and large language models (LLMs) to jointly optimize UAV agents toward achieving optimal networking performance. The framework incorporates a grouping strategy with reward decomposition to enhance algorithmic scalability and balance decision-making across UAVs. In addition, behavioral constraints are applied to selected key UAVs to improve the robustness of the network. Furthermore, the framework integrates LLM agents, leveraging knowledge distillation to transfer their high-level decision-making capabilities to MARL agents. This enhances both the efficiency of exploration and the overall training process. In the distillation module, a Hungarian algorithm-based matching scheme is applied to align the decision outputs of the LLM and MARL agents and define the distillation loss. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in network performance, including enhanced coverage and communication quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution Framework Centralized Enough for MARL?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17352v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has recently emerged as a popular framework for cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), where agents can use additional global state information to guide training in a centralized way and make their own decisions only based on decentralized local policies. Despite the encouraging results achieved, CTDE makes an independence assumption on agent policies, which limits agents to adopt global cooperative information from each other during centralized training. Therefore, we argue that existing CTDE methods cannot fully utilize global information for training, leading to an inefficient joint-policy exploration and even suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce a novel Centralized Advising and Decentralized Pruning (CADP) framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning, that not only enables an efficacious message exchange among agents during training but also guarantees the independent policies for execution. Firstly, CADP endows agents the explicit communication channel to seek and take advices from different agents for more centralized training. To further ensure the decentralized execution, we propose a smooth model pruning mechanism to progressively constraint the agent communication into a closed one without degradation in agent cooperation capability. Empirical evaluations on StarCraft II micromanagement and Google Research Football benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, the upcoming IEEE 802.11bn amendment introduces multi-access point coordination (MAPC) methods. This paper addresses a variant of MAPC called coordinated spatial reuse (C-SR), where devices transmit simultaneously on the same channel, with the power adjusted to minimize interference. The C-SR scheduling problem is selecting which devices transmit concurrently and with what settings. We provide a theoretical upper bound model, optimized for either throughput or fairness, which finds the best possible transmission schedule using mixed-integer linear programming. Then, a practical, probing-based approach is proposed which uses multi-armed bandits (MABs), a type of reinforcement learning, to solve the C-SR scheduling problem. We validate both classical (flat) MAB and hierarchical MAB (H-MAB) schemes with simulations and in a testbed. Using H-MABs for C-SR improves aggregate throughput over legacy IEEE 802.11 (on average by 80\% in random scenarios), without reducing the number of transmission opportunities per station. Finally, our framework is lightweight and ready for implementation in Wi-Fi devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 18 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, there is currently limited research on how to optimize diffusion-based polices (e.g., Diffusion Policy) fast and stably. In this paper, we propose an Adam-based Diffusion Policy Optimization (ADPO), a fast algorithmic framework containing best practices for fine-tuning diffusion-based polices in robotic control tasks using the adaptive gradient descent method in RL. Adaptive gradient method is less studied in training RL, let alone diffusion-based policies. We confirm that ADPO outperforms other diffusion-based RL methods in terms of overall effectiveness for fine-tuning on standard robotic tasks. Concretely, we conduct extensive experiments on standard robotic control tasks to test ADPO, where, particularly, six popular diffusion-based RL methods are provided as benchmark methods. Experimental results show that ADPO acquires better or comparable performance than the baseline methods. Finally, we systematically analyze the sensitivity of multiple hyperparameters in standard robotics tasks, providing guidance for subsequent practical applications. Our video demonstrations are released in https://github.com/Timeless-lab/ADPO.git.</p></details> |  |

Enabling the agent to gain a deeper understanding and adapt more efficiently to diverse working scenarios is crucial, and strategic knowledge utilization is a key factor in this process. This paper proposes a Knowledge Capture, Adaptation, and Composition (KCAC) framework to systematically integrate knowledge transfer into RL through cross-task curriculum learning. KCAC is evaluated using a two block stacking task in the CausalWorld benchmark, a complex robotic manipulation environment. To our knowledge, existing RL approaches fail to solve this task effectively, reflecting deficiencies in knowledge capture. In this work, we redesign the benchmark reward function by removing rigid constraints and strict ordering, allowing the agent to maximize total rewards concurrently and enabling flexible task completion. Furthermore, we define two self-designed sub-tasks and implement a structured cross-task curriculum to facilitate efficient learning. As a result, our KCAC approach achieves a 40 percent reduction in training time while improving task success rates by 10 percent compared to traditional RL methods. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key curriculum design parameters subtask selection, transition timing, and learning rate that optimize learning efficiency and provide conceptual guidance for curriculum based RL frameworks. This work offers valuable insights into curriculum design in RL and robotic learning.</p></details> |  |

Existing path planning methods for auxiliary cameras track two-dimensional surgical features but do not simultaneously account for camera orientation, workspace constraints, and robot joint limits. This study presents AutoCam: an automatic auxiliary camera placement method to improve visualization in RAMIS. Implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, the system uses a priority-based, workspace-constrained control algorithm that combines heuristic geometric placement with nonlinear optimization to ensure robust camera tracking. A user study (N=6) demonstrated that the system maintained 99.84% visibility of a salient feature and achieved a pose error of 4.36 $\pm$ 2.11 degrees and 1.95 $\pm$ 5.66 mm. The controller was computationally efficient, with a loop time of 6.8 $\pm$ 12.8 ms. An additional pilot study (N=6), where novices completed a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training task, suggests that users can teleoperate just as effectively from AutoCam's viewpoint as from the endoscope's while still benefiting from AutoCam's improved visual coverage of the scene. These results indicate that an auxiliary camera can be autonomously controlled using the da Vinci patient-side manipulators to track a salient feature, laying the groundwork for new multi-camera visualization methods in RAMIS.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Existing methods combining sampling-based planners with trajectory optimization produce suboptimal results and lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Physically-coupled discontinuity-bounded Conflict-Based Search (pc-dbCBS), an anytime kinodynamic motion planner, that extends discontinuity-bounded CBS to rigidly-coupled systems. Our approach proposes a tri-level conflict detection and resolution framework that includes the physical coupling between the robots. Moreover, pc-dbCBS alternates iteratively between state space representations, thereby preserving probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality while relying only on single-robot motion primitives. Across 25 simulated and six real-world problems involving multirotors carrying a cable-suspended payload and differential-drive robots linked by rigid rods, pc-dbCBS solves up to 92% more instances than a state-of-the-art baseline and plans trajectories that are 50-60% faster while reducing planning time by an order of magnitude.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Joint Robotic Aerial Base Station Deployment and Wireless Backhauling in 6G Multi-hop Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07714v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to their ability to anchor into tall urban landforms, such as lampposts or street lights, robotic aerial base stations (RABSs) can create a hyper-flexible wireless multi-hop heterogeneous network to meet the forthcoming green, densified, and dynamic network deployment to support, inter alia, high data rates. In this work, we propose a network infrastructure that can concurrently support the wireless backhaul link capacity and access link traffic demand in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band. The RABSs grasping locations, resource blocks (RBs) assignment, and route flow control are simultaneously optimized to maximize the served traffic demands. Robotic base stations capitalize on the fact that traffic distribution varies considerably across both time and space within a given geographical area. Hence, they are able to relocate to suitable locations, i.e., 'follow' the traffic demand as it unfolds to increase the overall network efficiency. To tackle the curse of dimensionality of the proposed mixed-integer linear problem, we propose a greedy algorithm to obtain a competitive solution with low computational complexity. Compared to baseline models, which are heterogeneous networks with randomly deployed fixed small cells and pre-allocated RBs for wireless access and backhaul links, a wide set of numerical investigations reveals that robotic base stations could improve the served traffic demand. Specifically, the proposed mode serves at most 65\% more traffic demand compared to an equal number of deployed fixed small cells.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version reflects the conference publication in 2025 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC), with a minor modified title and text content.

This paper proposes a Deep Learning (DL) and eXplainable AI (XAI) approach, equipping ARTO with interaction analysis capabilities to verify and validate the operations on cockpit components. During these interactions, forces, torques, and end effector poses are recorded and preprocessed to filter disturbances caused by low performance force controllers and embedded Force Torque Sensors (FTS). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) then classify the cobot actions as Success or Fail, while also identifying and reporting the causes of failure. To improve interpretability, Grad CAM, an XAI technique for visual explanations, is integrated to provide insights into the models decision making process. This approach enhances the reliability and trustworthiness of the automated testing system, facilitating the diagnosis and rectification of errors that may arise during testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Safe Robot Foundation Models Using Inductive Biases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10219v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety is a critical requirement for the real-world deployment of robotic systems. Unfortunately, while current robot foundation models show promising generalization capabilities across a wide variety of tasks, they fail to address safety, an important aspect for ensuring long-term operation. Current robot foundation models assume that safe behavior should emerge by learning from a sufficiently large dataset of demonstrations. However, this approach has two clear major drawbacks. Firstly, there are no formal safety guarantees for a behavior cloning policy trained using supervised learning. Secondly, without explicit knowledge of any safety constraints, the policy may require an unreasonable number of additional demonstrations to even approximate the desired constrained behavior. To solve these key issues, we show how we can instead combine robot foundation models with geometric inductive biases using ATACOM, a safety layer placed after the foundation policy that ensures safe state transitions by enforcing action constraints. With this approach, we can ensure formal safety guarantees for generalist policies without providing extensive demonstrations of safe behavior, and without requiring any specific fine-tuning for safety. Our experiments show that our approach can be beneficial both for classical manipulation tasks, where we avoid unwanted collisions with irrelevant objects, and for dynamic tasks, such as the robot air hockey environment, where we can generate fast trajectories respecting complex tasks and joint space constraints.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Some robots have already been tested in general-purpose scenarios such as homes and shopping malls. We aim to advance the research and application of embodied intelligence in industrial scenes. However, current EIR lacks a deep understanding of industrial environment semantics and the normative constraints between industrial operating objects. To address this gap, this paper first reviews the history of industrial robotics and the mainstream EIR frameworks. We then introduce the concept of the embodied intelligent industrial robotics (EIIR) and propose a knowledge-driven EIIR technology framework for industrial environments. The framework includes four main modules: world model, high-level task planner, low-level skill controller, and simulator. We also review the current development of technologies related to each module and highlight recent progress in adapting them to industrial applications. Finally, we summarize the key challenges EIIR faces in industrial scenarios and suggest future research directions. We believe that EIIR technology will shape the next generation of industrial robotics. Industrial systems based on embodied intelligent industrial robots offer strong potential for enabling intelligent manufacturing. We will continue to track and summarize new research in this area and hope this review will serve as a valuable reference for scholars and engineers interested in industrial embodied intelligence.

A novel framework named LLM A*, aims to leverage the commonsense of LLMs, and the utility-optimal A* is proposed to facilitate few-shot near-optimal path planning. Prompts are used for two main purposes: 1) to provide LLMs with essential information like environments, costs, heuristics, etc.; 2) to communicate human feedback on intermediate planning results to LLMs. This approach takes human feedback on board and renders the entire planning process transparent (akin to a `white box') to humans. Moreover, it facilitates code-free path planning, thereby fostering the accessibility and inclusiveness of artificial intelligence techniques to communities less proficient in coding. Comparative analysis against A* and RL demonstrates that LLM A* exhibits greater efficiency in terms of search space and achieves paths comparable to A* while outperforming RL. The interactive nature of LLM A* also makes it a promising tool for deployment in collaborative human-robot tasks.

However, the most effective way of guiding novice teachers to approach expert-level demonstrations quantitatively for specific teaching tasks remains an open question. To this end, this paper investigates the use of machine teaching (MT) to guide novice teachers to improve their teaching skills based on reinforcement learning from demonstration (RLfD). The paper reports an experiment in which novices receive MT-derived guidance to train their ability to teach a given motor skill with only 8 demonstrations and generalise this to previously unseen ones. Results indicate that the MT-guidance not only enhances robot learning performance by 89% on the training skill but also causes a 70% improvement in robot learning performance on skills not seen by subjects during training. These findings highlight the effectiveness of MT-guidance in upskilling human teaching behaviours, ultimately improving demonstration quality in RLfD.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Current approaches suffer from significant domain gaps between training datasets and robot manipulation tasks, while also lacking model architectures that can effectively incorporate 3D information. To overcome these limitations, we enhance the DROID dataset with high-quality depth maps and point clouds, constructing DROID-3D as a valuable supplement for 3D embodied vision research. Then we develop EmbodiedMAE, a multi-modal masked autoencoder that simultaneously learns representations across RGB, depth, and point cloud modalities through stochastic masking and cross-modal fusion. Trained on DROID-3D, EmbodiedMAE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art vision foundation models (VFMs) in both training efficiency and final performance across 70 simulation tasks and 20 real-world robot manipulation tasks on two robot platforms. The model exhibits strong scaling behavior with size and promotes effective policy learning from 3D inputs. Experimental results establish EmbodiedMAE as a reliable unified 3D multi-modal VFM for embodied AI systems, particularly in precise tabletop manipulation settings where spatial perception is critical.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we consider world models that operate on RGB-D frames (RGB-D world models). As opposed to canonical approaches that handle dynamics prediction mostly implicitly and reconcile it with visual rendering in a single model, we introduce FlowDreamer, which adopts 3D scene flow as explicit motion representations. FlowDreamer first predicts 3D scene flow from past frame and action conditions with a U-Net, and then a diffusion model will predict the future frame utilizing the scene flow. FlowDreamer is trained end-to-end despite its modularized nature. We conduct experiments on 4 different benchmarks, covering both video prediction and visual planning tasks. The results demonstrate that FlowDreamer achieves better performance compared to other baseline RGB-D world models by 7% on semantic similarity, 11% on pixel quality, and 6% on success rate in various robot manipulation domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: see https://sharinka0715.github.io/FlowDreamer/</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Robot Task Allocation for Homogeneous Tasks with Collision Avoidance via Spatial Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10073v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, a novel framework is presented that achieves a combined solution based on Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) and collision avoidance with respect to homogeneous measurement tasks taking place in industrial environments. The spatial clustering we propose offers to simultaneously solve the task allocation problem and deal with collision risks by cutting the workspace into distinguishable operational zones for each robot. To divide task sites and to schedule robot routes within corresponding clusters, we use K-means clustering and the 2-Opt algorithm. The presented framework shows satisfactory performance, where up to 93\% time reduction (1.24s against 17.62s) with a solution quality improvement of up to 7\% compared to the best performing method is demonstrated. Our method also completely eliminates collision points that persist in comparative methods in a most significant sense. Theoretical analysis agrees with the claim that spatial partitioning unifies the apparently disjoint tasks allocation and collision avoidance problems under conditions of many identical tasks to be distributed over sparse geographical areas. Ultimately, the findings in this work are of substantial importance for real world applications where both computational efficiency and operation free from collisions is of paramount importance.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, Scheduled for presentation at an upcoming conference</p></details> |

The numerous applications of agricultural robots rely on the transmission of data via mobile network, with the amount of data depending on the services offered by the robots and the level of on-board technology. Nevertheless, infrastructure required to deploy these robots, as well as the related energy and environmental consequences, appear overlooked in the digital agriculture literature. In this study, we propose a method for assessing the additional energy consumption and carbon footprint induced by a large-scale deployment of agricultural robots. Our method also estimates the share of agricultural area that can be managed by the deployed robots with respect to network infrastructure constraints. We have applied this method to metropolitan France mobile network and agricultural parcels for five different robotic scenarios. Our results show that increasing the robot's bitrate needs leads to significant additional impacts, which increase at a pace that is poorly captured by classical linear extrapolation methods. When constraining the network to the existing sites, increased bitrate needs also comes with a rapidly decreasing manageable agricultural area.</p></details> |  |

Our method partitions the workspace, assigns fruit-picking sequences to arms, determines tight and feasible fruit-picking schedules and vehicle travel speed, and generates smooth, collision-free arm trajectories. The fruit-picking throughput achieved by the algorithm was assessed using synthetically generated fruit coordinates and a harvester design featuring up to 12 arms. The throughput increased monotonically as more arms were added. Adding more arms when fruit densities were low resulted in diminishing gains because it took longer to travel from one fruit to another. However, when there were enough fruits, the proposed algorithm achieved a linear speedup as the number of arms increased.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work will be submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[APEX: Action Priors Enable Efficient Exploration for Skill Imitation on Articulated Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10022v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning by imitation provides an effective way for robots to develop well-regulated complex behaviors and directly benefit from natural demonstrations. State-of-the-art imitation learning (IL) approaches typically leverage Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP), which, despite their impressive results, suffer from two key limitations. They are prone to mode collapse, which often leads to overfitting to the simulation environment and thus increased sim-to-real gap, and they struggle to learn diverse behaviors effectively. To overcome these limitations, we introduce APEX (Action Priors enable Efficient eXploration): a simple yet versatile imitation learning framework that integrates demonstrations directly into reinforcement learning (RL), maintaining high exploration while grounding behavior with expert-informed priors. We achieve this through a combination of decaying action priors, which initially bias exploration toward expert demonstrations but gradually allow the policy to explore independently. This is complemented by a multi-critic RL framework that effectively balances stylistic consistency with task performance. Our approach achieves sample-efficient imitation learning and enables the acquisition of diverse skills within a single policy. APEX generalizes to varying velocities and preserves reference-like styles across complex tasks such as navigating rough terrain and climbing stairs, utilizing only flat-terrain kinematic motion data as a prior. We validate our framework through extensive hardware experiments on the Unitree Go2 quadruped. There, APEX yields diverse and agile locomotion gaits, inherent gait transitions, and the highest reported speed for the platform to the best of our knowledge (peak velocity of ~3.3 m/s on hardware). Our results establish APEX as a compelling alternative to existing IL methods, offering better efficiency, adaptability, and real-world performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Diverse Natural Behaviors for Enhancing the Agility of Quadrupedal Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09979v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving animal-like agility is a longstanding goal in quadrupedal robotics. While recent studies have successfully demonstrated imitation of specific behaviors, enabling robots to replicate a broader range of natural behaviors in real-world environments remains an open challenge. Here we propose an integrated controller comprising a Basic Behavior Controller (BBC) and a Task-Specific Controller (TSC) which can effectively learn diverse natural quadrupedal behaviors in an enhanced simulator and efficiently transfer them to the real world. Specifically, the BBC is trained using a novel semi-supervised generative adversarial imitation learning algorithm to extract diverse behavioral styles from raw motion capture data of real dogs, enabling smooth behavior transitions by adjusting discrete and continuous latent variable inputs. The TSC, trained via privileged learning with depth images as input, coordinates the BBC to efficiently perform various tasks. Additionally, we employ evolutionary adversarial simulator identification to optimize the simulator, aligning it closely with reality. After training, the robot exhibits diverse natural behaviors, successfully completing the quadrupedal agility challenge at an average speed of 1.1 m/s and achieving a peak speed of 3.2 m/s during hurdling. This work represents a substantial step toward animal-like agility in quadrupedal robots, opening avenues for their deployment in increasingly complex real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

We present a geometric and mechanical framework for Yoshimura-Ori modules that supports a diverse set of metastable states, including newly identified asymmetric "pop-out" and "hyperfolded" configurations. These states are governed by three parameters -- tilt angle, phase shift, and slant height -- and enable discrete, programmable transformations. Using this model, we develop forward and inverse kinematic strategies to stack modules into deployable booms that approximate complex 3D shapes. We validate our approach through mechanical tests and demonstrate a tendon- and pneumatically-actuated Yoshimura Space Crane capable of object manipulation, solar tracking, and high load-bearing performance. A meter-scale solar charging station further illustrates the design's scalability. These results establish Yoshimura-Ori structures as a promising platform for adaptable, multifunctional deployable systems in both terrestrial and space environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-SAFE: Shared Autonomy Framework with Diffusion for Safe Human-to-Robot Driving Handover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09889v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe handover in shared autonomy for vehicle control is well-established in modern vehicles. However, avoiding accidents often requires action several seconds in advance. This necessitates understanding human driver behavior and an expert control strategy for seamless intervention when a collision or unsafe state is predicted. We propose Diffusion-SAFE, a closed-loop shared autonomy framework leveraging diffusion models to: (1) predict human driving behavior for detection of potential risks, (2) generate safe expert trajectories, and (3) enable smooth handovers by blending human and expert policies over a short time horizon. Unlike prior works which use engineered score functions to rate driving performance, our approach enables both performance evaluation and optimal action sequence generation from demonstrations. By adjusting the forward and reverse processes of the diffusion-based copilot, our method ensures a gradual transition of control authority, by mimicking the drivers' behavior before intervention, which mitigates abrupt takeovers, leading to smooth transitions. We evaluated Diffusion-SAFE in both simulation (CarRacing-v0) and real-world (ROS-based race car), measuring human-driving similarity, safety, and computational efficiency. Results demonstrate a 98.5\% successful handover rate, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in progressively correcting human actions and continuously sampling optimal robot actions.</p></details> |  |

However, they often fail to capture the level of detail required for inspection and scene awareness tasks. Conversely, dense SLAM approaches generate richer scene reconstructions but impose a prohibitive computational load to create 3D maps. We present a novel distributed volumetric mapping framework designated as CRADMap that addresses these issues by extending the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ORBSLAM3 system with the COVINS on the backend for global optimization. Our pipeline for volumetric reconstruction fuses dense keyframes at a centralized server via 5G connectivity, aggregating geometry, and occupancy information from multiple autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) without overtaxing onboard resources. This enables each AMR to independently perform mapping while the backend constructs high-fidelity real-time 3D maps. To operate Beyond the Visible (BtV) and overcome the limitations of standard visual sensors, we automated a standalone 4D mmWave radar module that functions independently without sensor fusion with SLAM. The BtV system enables the detection and mapping of occluded metallic objects in cluttered environments, enhancing situational awareness in inspection scenarios. Experimental validation in Section~\ref{sec:IV} demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, IEEE, ICARM</p></details> |
| **[Neural Associative Skill Memories for safer robotics and modelling human sensorimotor repertoires](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09760v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern robots face challenges shared by humans, where machines must learn multiple sensorimotor skills and express them adaptively. Equipping robots with a human-like memory of how it feels to do multiple stereotypical movements can make robots more aware of normal operational states and help develop self-preserving safer robots. Associative Skill Memories (ASMs) aim to address this by linking movement primitives to sensory feedback, but existing implementations rely on hard-coded libraries of individual skills. A key unresolved problem is how a single neural network can learn a repertoire of skills while enabling fault detection and context-aware execution. Here we introduce Neural Associative Skill Memories (ASMs), a framework that utilises self-supervised predictive coding for temporal prediction to unify skill learning and expression, using biologically plausible learning rules. Unlike traditional ASMs which require explicit skill selection, Neural ASMs implicitly recognize and express skills through contextual inference, enabling fault detection across learned behaviours without an explicit skill selection mechanism. Compared to recurrent neural networks trained via backpropagation through time, our model achieves comparable qualitative performance in skill memory expression while using local learning rules and predicts a biologically relevant speed-accuracy trade-off during skill memory expression. This work advances the field of neurorobotics by demonstrating how predictive coding principles can model adaptive robot control and human motor preparation. By unifying fault detection, reactive control, skill memorisation and expression into a single energy-based architecture, Neural ASMs contribute to safer robotics and provide a computational lens to study biological sensorimotor learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[On-Robot Reinforcement Learning with Goal-Contrastive Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19989v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to enable robots to learn from their own actions in the real world. Unfortunately, RL can be prohibitively expensive, in terms of on-robot runtime, due to inefficient exploration when learning from a sparse reward signal. Designing dense reward functions is labour-intensive and requires domain expertise. In our work, we propose GCR (Goal-Contrastive Rewards), a dense reward function learning method that can be trained on passive video demonstrations. By using videos without actions, our method is easier to scale, as we can use arbitrary videos. GCR combines two loss functions, an implicit value loss function that models how the reward increases when traversing a successful trajectory, and a goal-contrastive loss that discriminates between successful and failed trajectories. We perform experiments in simulated manipulation environments across RoboMimic and MimicGen tasks, as well as in the real world using a Franka arm and a Spot quadruped. We find that GCR leads to a more-sample efficient RL, enabling model-free RL to solve about twice as many tasks as our baseline reward learning methods. We also demonstrate positive cross-embodiment transfer from videos of people and of other robots performing a task. Website: https://gcr-robot.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

In robotic manipulation, VLMs are used primarily as high-level planners, but recent work has also studied their lower-level reasoning ability, which refers to making decisions about precise robot movements. However, the community currently lacks a clear and common benchmark that can evaluate how well VLMs can aid low-level reasoning in robotics. Consequently, we propose a novel benchmark, ManipBench, to evaluate the low-level robot manipulation reasoning capabilities of VLMs across various dimensions, including how well they understand object-object interactions and deformable object manipulation. We extensively test 33 representative VLMs across 10 model families on our benchmark, including variants to test different model sizes. Our evaluation shows that the performance of VLMs significantly varies across tasks, and there is a strong correlation between this performance and trends in our real-world manipulation tasks. It also shows that there remains a significant gap between these models and human-level understanding.

| **[DataMIL: Selecting Data for Robot Imitation Learning with Datamodels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09603v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the robotics community has amassed ever larger and more diverse datasets to train generalist robot policies. However, while these policies achieve strong mean performance across a variety of tasks, they often underperform on individual, specialized tasks and require further tuning on newly acquired task-specific data. Combining task-specific data with carefully curated subsets of large prior datasets via co-training can produce better specialized policies, but selecting data naively may actually harm downstream performance. To address this, we introduce DataMIL, a policy-driven data selection framework built on the datamodels paradigm that reasons about data selection in an end-to-end manner, using the policy itself to identify which data points will most improve performance. Unlike standard practices that filter data using human notions of quality (e.g., based on semantic or visual similarity), DataMIL directly optimizes data selection for task success, allowing us to select data that enhance the policy while dropping data that degrade it. To avoid performing expensive rollouts in the environment during selection, we use a novel surrogate loss function on task-specific data, allowing us to use DataMIL in the real world without degrading performance. We validate our approach on a suite of more than 60 simulation and real-world manipulation tasks - most notably showing successful data selection from the Open X-Embodiment datasets-demonstrating consistent gains in success rates and superior performance over multiple baselines. Our results underscore the importance of end-to-end, performance-aware data selection for unlocking the potential of large prior datasets in robotics.

| **[Real2Render2Real: Scaling Robot Data Without Dynamics Simulation or Robot Hardware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09601v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling robot learning requires vast and diverse datasets. Yet the prevailing data collection paradigm-human teleoperation-remains costly and constrained by manual effort and physical robot access. We introduce Real2Render2Real (R2R2R), a novel approach for generating robot training data without relying on object dynamics simulation or teleoperation of robot hardware. The input is a smartphone-captured scan of one or more objects and a single video of a human demonstration. R2R2R renders thousands of high visual fidelity robot-agnostic demonstrations by reconstructing detailed 3D object geometry and appearance, and tracking 6-DoF object motion. R2R2R uses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to enable flexible asset generation and trajectory synthesis for both rigid and articulated objects, converting these representations to meshes to maintain compatibility with scalable rendering engines like IsaacLab but with collision modeling off. Robot demonstration data generated by R2R2R integrates directly with models that operate on robot proprioceptive states and image observations, such as vision-language-action models (VLA) and imitation learning policies. Physical experiments suggest that models trained on R2R2R data from a single human demonstration can match the performance of models trained on 150 human teleoperation demonstrations.

In this paper, we introduce a novel formation control system for an indoor blimp swarm using a specialized leader-follower approach enhanced with a dynamic leader-switching mechanism. This strategy allows any blimp to take on the leader role, distributing maneuvering demands across the swarm and enhancing overall formation stability. Only the leader blimp is manually controlled by a human operator, while follower blimps use onboard monocular cameras and a laser altimeter for relative position and altitude estimation. A leader-switching scheme is proposed to assist the human operator to maintain stability of the swarm, especially when a sharp turn is performed. Experimental results confirm that the leader-switching mechanism effectively maintains stable formations and adapts to dynamic indoor environments while assisting human operator.</p></details> |  |

However, existing FM-enabled robots primary operate in closed-world settings, where the robot is given a full prior map or has a full view of its workspace. This paper addresses the deployment of FM-enabled robots in the field, where missions often require a robot to operate in large-scale and unstructured environments. To effectively accomplish these missions, robots must actively explore their environments, navigate obstacle-cluttered terrain, handle unexpected sensor inputs, and operate with compute constraints. We discuss recent deployments of SPINE, our LLM-enabled autonomy framework, in field robotic settings. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first demonstration of large-scale LLM-enabled robot planning in unstructured environments with several kilometers of missions. SPINE is agnostic to a particular LLM, which allows us to distill small language models capable of running onboard size, weight and power (SWaP) limited platforms. Via preliminary model distillation work, we then present the first language-driven UAV planner using on-device language models. We conclude our paper by proposing several promising directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE ICRA Workshop on Field Robotics 2025</p></details> |

In domains from NLP to Computer Vision, this has led to a consolidation of pretrained models, with general pretrained backbones serving as a starting point for many applications. Can such a consolidation happen in robotics? Conventionally, robotic learning methods train a separate model for every application, every robot, and even every environment. Can we instead train generalist X-robot policy that can be adapted efficiently to new robots, tasks, and environments? In this paper, we provide datasets in standardized data formats and models to make it possible to explore this possibility in the context of robotic manipulation, alongside experimental results that provide an example of effective X-robot policies. We assemble a dataset from 22 different robots collected through a collaboration between 21 institutions, demonstrating 527 skills (160266 tasks).

However, existing methods still struggle with precision manipulation task and rely on inefficient image/point cloud observations. In this paper, we explore to introduce SE(3) object pose into imitation learning and propose the pose-guided efficient imitation learning methods for robotic precise insertion task. First, we propose a precise insertion diffusion policy which utilizes the relative SE(3) pose as the observation-action pair. The policy models the source object SE(3) pose trajectory relative to the target object. Second, we explore to introduce the RGBD data to the pose-guided diffusion policy. Specifically, we design a goal-conditioned RGBD encoder to capture the discrepancy between the current state and the goal state. In addition, a pose-guided residual gated fusion method is proposed, which takes pose features as the backbone, and the RGBD features selectively compensate for pose feature deficiencies through an adaptive gating mechanism. Our methods are evaluated on 6 robotic precise insertion tasks, demonstrating competitive performance with only 7-10 demonstrations. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods can successfully complete precision insertion tasks with a clearance of about 0.01 mm. Experimental results highlight its superior efficiency and generalization capability compared to existing baselines.

While many potential benefits are associated with robotic care technologies, there is a variety of ethical challenges. To support steps towards a responsible implementation and use, this review develops an overview on ethical aspects of the use of social robots in elderly care from a decision-makers' perspective. Methods: Electronic databases were queried using a comprehensive search strategy based on the key concepts of "ethical aspects", "social robotics" and "elderly care". Abstract and title screening was conducted by two authors independently. Full-text screening was conducted by one author following a joint consolidation phase. Data was extracted using MAXQDA24 by one author, based on a consolidated coding framework. Analysis was performed through modified qualitative content analysis. Results: A total of 1,518 publications were screened, and 248 publications were included. We have organized our analysis in a scheme of ethical hazards, ethical opportunities and unsettled questions, identifying at least 60 broad ethical aspects affecting three different stakeholder groups. While some ethical issues are well-known and broadly discussed our analysis shows a plethora of potentially relevant aspects, often only marginally recognized, that are worthy of consideration from a practical perspective. Discussion: The findings highlight the need for a contextual and detailed evaluation of implementation scenarios. To make use of the vast knowledge of the ethical discourse, we hypothesize that decision-makers need to understand the specific nature of this discourse to be able to engage in careful ethical deliberation.</p></details> | <details><summary>93 pa...</summary><p>93 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables, 3 suplements</p></details> |

This efficiency makes them an attractive model system for developing artificial collision-detecting systems. Specifically, researchers have identified collision-selective neurons in the locust's optic lobe, called lobula giant movement detectors (LGMDs), which respond specifically to approaching objects. Research upon LGMD neurons began in the early 1970s. Initially, due to their large size, these neurons were identified as motion detectors, but their role as looming detectors was recognized over time. Since then, progress in neuroscience, computational modeling of LGMD's visual neural circuits, and LGMD-based robotics have advanced in tandem, each field supporting and driving the others. Today, with a deeper understanding of LGMD neurons, LGMD-based models have significantly improved collision-free navigation in mobile robots including ground and aerial robots. This review highlights recent developments in LGMD research from the perspectives of neuroscience, computational modeling, and robotics. It emphasizes a biologically plausible research paradigm, where insights from neuroscience inform real-world applications, which would in turn validate and advance neuroscience. With strong support from extensive research and growing application demand, this paradigm has reached a mature stage and demonstrates versatility across different areas of neuroscience research, thereby enhancing our understanding of the interconnections between neuroscience, computational modeling, and robotics. Furthermore, this paradigm would shed light upon the modeling and robotic research into other motion-sensitive neurons or neural circuits.</p></details> | 35 pages, 6 figures |

In this paper, we propose a unified framework for Robot-Assisted Drone Recovery on a Wavy Surface that addresses two major tasks: Firstly, accurate prediction of a moving drone's position under wave-induced disturbances using an Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF), and secondly, effective motion planning for a manipulator via Receding Horizon Control (RHC). Specifically, the ESKF predicts the drone's future position 0.5s ahead, while the manipulator plans a capture trajectory in real time, thus overcoming not only wave-induced base motions but also limited torque constraints. We provide a system design that comprises a manipulator subsystem and a UAV subsystem. On the UAV side, we detail how position control and suspended payload strategies are implemented. On the manipulator side, we show how an RHC scheme outperforms traditional low-level control algorithms. Simulation and real-world experiments - using wave-disturbed motion data - demonstrate that our approach achieves a high success rate - above 95% and outperforms conventional baseline methods by up to 10% in efficiency and 20% in precision. The results underscore the feasibility and robustness of our system, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and offers a practical solution for maritime drone operations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 15 figures |

While modern Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can handle diverse robotic tasks, they often incur high per-step inference costs, resulting in significant latency, sometimes minutes per task. In contrast, RT-cache stores a large-scale Memory of previously successful robot trajectories and retrieves relevant multistep motion snippets, drastically reducing inference overhead. By integrating a Memory Builder with a Trajectory Retrieval, we develop an efficient retrieval process that remains tractable even for extremely large datasets. RT-cache flexibly accumulates real-world experiences and replays them whenever the current scene matches past states, adapting quickly to new or unseen environments with only a few additional samples. Experiments on the Open-X Embodiment Dataset and other real-world data demonstrate that RT-cache completes tasks both faster and more successfully than a baseline lacking retrieval, suggesting a practical, data-driven solution for real-time manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures.

In humans, inner speech structures thought processes and decision-making; in robotics, it improves explainability by making reasoning explicit. This is crucial in healthcare scenarios, where trust in robotic assistants depends on both accurate recommendations and human-like dialogue, which make interactions more natural and engaging. Building on this, we developed a social robot that provides dietary advice, and we provided the architecture with inner speech capabilities to validate user input, refine reasoning, and generate clear justifications. The system integrates large language models for natural language understanding and a knowledge graph for structured dietary information. By making decisions more transparent, our approach strengthens trust and improves human-robot interaction in healthcare. We validated this by measuring the computational efficiency of our architecture and conducting a small user study, which assessed the reliability of inner speech in explaining the robot's behavior.</p></details> |  |

However, these policies remain highly sensitive to domain shifts stemming from background or robot embodiment changes, which limits their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we present ARRO, a novel calibration-free visual representation that leverages zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation and object detection models to efficiently mask out task-irrelevant regions of the scene without requiring additional training. By filtering visual distractors and overlaying virtual guides during both training and inference, ARRO improves robustness to scene variations and reduces the need for additional data collection. We extensively evaluate ARRO with Diffusion Policy on several tabletop manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments, and further demonstrate its compatibility and effectiveness with generalist robot policies, such as Octo and OpenVLA. Across all settings in our evaluation, ARRO yields consistent performance gains, allows for selective masking to choose between different objects, and shows robustness even to challenging segmentation conditions.

We address these limitations by integrating DMP controllers into a BT framework, jointly learning the BT structure and DMP actions from single demonstrations, thereby removing the need for predefined actions. Additionally, by combining BT decision logic with DMP motion generation, our method enhances policy interpretability, modularity, and adaptability for autonomous systems. Our approach readily affords both learning to replicate low-level motions and combining partial demonstrations into a coherent and easy-to-modify overall policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, accepted (not yet published) at IAS19 2025 conference</p></details> |

Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, while building on top of general Vision-Language Models (VLMs), still fall short of achieving robust zero-shot performance due to the scarcity and heterogeneity prevalent in embodied datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FSD (From Seeing to Doing), a novel vision-language model that generates intermediate representations through spatial relationship reasoning, providing fine-grained guidance for robotic manipulation. Our approach combines a hierarchical data pipeline for training with a self-consistency mechanism that aligns spatial coordinates with visual signals. Through extensive experiments, we comprehensively validated FSD's capabilities in both "seeing" and "doing," achieving outstanding performance across 8 benchmarks for general spatial reasoning and embodied reference abilities, as well as on our proposed more challenging benchmark VABench. We also verified zero-shot capabilities in robot manipulation, demonstrating significant performance improvements over baseline methods in both SimplerEnv and real robot settings. Experimental results show that FSD achieves 54.1% success rate in SimplerEnv and 72% success rate across 8 real-world tasks, outperforming the strongest baseline by 30%.</p></details> | Early version |
| **[Achieving Scalable Robot Autonomy via neurosymbolic planning using lightweight local LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08492v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>PDDL-based symbolic task planning remains pivotal for robot autonomy yet struggles with dynamic human-robot collaboration due to scalability, re-planning demands, and delayed plan availability. Although a few neurosymbolic frameworks have previously leveraged LLMs such as GPT-3 to address these challenges, reliance on closed-source, remote models with limited context introduced critical constraints: third-party dependency, inconsistent response times, restricted plan length and complexity, and multi-domain scalability issues. We present Gideon, a novel framework that enables the transition to modern, smaller, local LLMs with extended context length. Gideon integrates a novel problem generator to systematically generate large-scale datasets of realistic domain-problem-plan tuples for any domain, and adapts neurosymbolic planning for local LLMs, enabling on-device execution and extended context for multi-domain support. Preliminary experiments in single-domain scenarios performed on Qwen-2.5 1.5B and trained on 8k-32k samples, demonstrate a valid plan percentage of 66.1% (32k model) and show that the figure can be further scaled through additional data. Multi-domain tests on 16k samples yield an even higher 70.6% planning validity rate, proving extensibility across domains and signaling that data variety can have a positive effect on learning efficiency. Although long-horizon planning and reduced model size make Gideon training much less efficient than baseline models based on larger LLMs, the results are still significant considering that the trained model is about 120x smaller than baseline and that significant advantages can be achieved in inference efficiency, scalability, and multi-domain adaptability, all critical factors in human-robot collaboration. Training inefficiency can be mitigated by Gideon's streamlined data generation pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, accepted at IAS 2025</p></details> |

However, current VLA models face significant challenges: they are slow during inference and require extensive pre-training on large amounts of robotic data, making real-world deployment difficult. In this paper, we introduce a new family of compact vision-language-action models, called TinyVLA, which offers two key advantages over existing VLA models: (1) faster inference speeds, and (2) improved data efficiency, eliminating the need for pre-training stage. Our framework incorporates two essential components to build TinyVLA: (1) initializing the policy backbone with robust, high-speed multimodal models, and (2) integrating a diffusion policy decoder during fine-tuning to enable precise robot actions. We conducted extensive evaluations of TinyVLA in both simulation and on real robots, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model, OpenVLA, in terms of speed and data efficiency, while delivering comparable or superior performance. Additionally, TinyVLA exhibits strong generalization capabilities across various dimensions, including language instructions, novel objects, unseen positions, changes in object appearance, background variations, and environmental shifts, often matching or exceeding the performance of OpenVLA. We believe that \methodname offers an interesting perspective on utilizing pre-trained multimodal models for policy learning.

While vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise for generalizable robot skills, realizing their full potential requires addressing limitations in action representation and efficient training. Current VLA models often focus on scaling the vision-language model (VLM) component, while the action space representation remains a critical bottleneck. This paper introduces DexVLA, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency and generalization capabilities of VLAs for complex, long-horizon tasks across diverse robot embodiments. DexVLA features a novel diffusion-based action expert, scaled to one billion parameters, designed for cross-embodiment learning. A novel embodiment curriculum learning strategy facilitates efficient training: (1) pre-training the diffusion expert that is separable from the VLA on cross-embodiment data, (2) aligning the VLA model to specific embodiments, and (3) post-training for rapid adaptation to new tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple embodiments, including single-arm, bimanual, and dexterous hand, demonstrating DexVLA's adaptability to challenging tasks without task-specific adaptation, its ability to learn dexterous skills on novel embodiments with limited data, and its capacity to complete complex, long-horizon tasks using only direct language prompting, such as laundry folding. In all settings, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models like Octo, OpenVLA, and Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The w...</summary><p>The webpage is at https://dex-vla.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[HMR-ODTA: Online Diverse Task Allocation for a Team of Heterogeneous Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08419v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinating time-sensitive deliveries in environments like hospitals poses a complex challenge, particularly when managing multiple online pickup and delivery requests within strict time windows using a team of heterogeneous robots. Traditional approaches fail to address dynamic rescheduling or diverse service requirements, typically restricting robots to single-task types. This paper tackles the Multi-Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (MPDPTW), where autonomous mobile robots are capable of handling varied service requests. The objective is to minimize late delivery penalties while maximizing task completion rates. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework leveraging a heterogeneous robot team and an efficient dynamic scheduling algorithm that supports dynamic task rescheduling. Users submit requests with specific time constraints, and our decentralized algorithm, Heterogeneous Mobile Robots Online Diverse Task Allocation (HMR-ODTA), optimizes task assignments to ensure timely service while addressing delays or task rejections. Extensive simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness. For smaller task sets (40-160 tasks), penalties were reduced by nearly 63%, while for larger sets (160-280 tasks), penalties decreased by approximately 50%. These results highlight the algorithm's effectiveness in improving task scheduling and coordination in multi-robot systems, offering a robust solution for enhancing delivery performance in structured, time-critical environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[ORACLE-Grasp: Zero-Shot Task-Oriented Robotic Grasping using Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08417v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grasping unknown objects in unstructured environments remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, requiring both semantic understanding and spatial reasoning. Existing methods often rely on dense training datasets or explicit geometric modeling, limiting their scalability to real-world tasks. Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offer new possibilities for integrating vision and language understanding, but their application to autonomous robotic grasping remains largely unexplored. We present ORACLE-Grasp, a zero-shot framework that leverages LMMs as semantic oracles to guide grasp selection without requiring additional training or human input. The system formulates grasp prediction as a structured, iterative decision process, using dual-prompt tool calling to first extract high-level object context and then select task-relevant grasp regions. By discretizing the image space and reasoning over candidate areas, ORACLE-Grasp mitigates the spatial imprecision common in LMMs and produces human-like, task-driven grasp suggestions. Early stopping and depth-based refinement steps further enhance efficiency and physical grasp reliability. Experiments demonstrate that the predicted grasps achieve low positional and orientation errors relative to human-annotated ground truth and lead to high success rates in real-world pick up tasks. These results highlight the potential of combining language-driven reasoning with lightweight vision techniques to enable robust, autonomous grasping without task-specific datasets or retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-VLA: Scaling Robot Foundation Models via Unified Diffusion and Autoregression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03293v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present DiffusionVLA, a novel framework that seamlessly combines the autoregression model with the diffusion model for learning visuomotor policy. Central to our approach is a next-token prediction objective, enabling the model to reason effectively over the user's query in the context of current observations. Subsequently, a diffusion model is attached to generate robust action outputs. To enhance policy learning through self-reasoning, we introduce a novel reasoning injection module that integrates reasoning phrases directly into the policy learning process. The whole framework is simple and flexible, making it easy to deploy and upgrade. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple real robots to validate the effectiveness of DiffusionVLA. Our tests include a challenging factory sorting task, where DiffusionVLA successfully categorizes objects, including those not seen during training. We observe that the reasoning module makes the model interpretable. It allows observers to understand the model thought process and identify potential causes of policy failures. Additionally, we test DiffusionVLA on a zero-shot bin-picking task, achieving 63.7\% accuracy on 102 previously unseen objects. Our method demonstrates robustness to visual changes, such as distractors and new backgrounds, and easily adapts to new embodiments. Furthermore, DiffusionVLA can follow novel instructions and retain conversational ability. Notably, DiffusionVLA is data-efficient and fast at inference; our smallest DiffusionVLA-2B runs 82Hz on a single A6000 GPU and can train from scratch on less than 50 demonstrations for a complex task. Finally, we scale the model from 2B to 72B parameters, showcasing improved generalization capabilities with increased model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project page is available at: http://diffusion-vla.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Diffusion Policy Optimization for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08376v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown the great potential of diffusion models in improving reinforcement learning (RL) by modeling complex policies, expressing a high degree of multi-modality, and efficiently handling high-dimensional continuous control tasks. However, there is currently limited research on how to optimize diffusion-based polices (e.g., Diffusion Policy) fast and stably. In this paper, we propose an Adam-based Diffusion Policy Optimization (ADPO), a fast algorithmic framework containing best practices for fine-tuning diffusion-based polices in robotic control tasks using the adaptive gradient descent method in RL. Adaptive gradient method is less studied in training RL, let alone diffusion-based policies. We confirm that ADPO outperforms other diffusion-based RL methods in terms of overall effectiveness for fine-tuning on standard robotic tasks. Concretely, we conduct extensive experiments on standard robotic control tasks to test ADPO, where, particularly, six popular diffusion-based RL methods are provided as benchmark methods. Experimental results show that ADPO acquires better or comparable performance than the baseline methods. Finally, we systematically analyze the sensitivity of multiple hyperparameters in standard robotics tasks, providing guidance for subsequent practical applications. Our video demonstrations are released in https://github.com/Timeless-lab/ADPO.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[MA-ROESL: Motion-aware Rapid Reward Optimization for Efficient Robot Skill Learning from Single Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08367v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated excellent high-level planning capabilities, enabling locomotion skill learning from video demonstrations without the need for meticulous human-level reward design. However, the improper frame sampling method and low training efficiency of current methods remain a critical bottleneck, resulting in substantial computational overhead and time costs. To address this limitation, we propose Motion-aware Rapid Reward Optimization for Efficient Robot Skill Learning from Single Videos (MA-ROESL). MA-ROESL integrates a motion-aware frame selection method to implicitly enhance the quality of VLM-generated reward functions. It further employs a hybrid three-phase training pipeline that improves training efficiency via rapid reward optimization and derives the final policy through online fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that MA-ROESL significantly enhances training efficiency while faithfully reproducing locomotion skills in both simulated and real-world settings, thereby underscoring its potential as a robust and scalable framework for efficient robot locomotion skill learning from video demonstrations.</p></details> |  |
| **[ERPoT: Effective and Reliable Pose Tracking for Mobile Robots Using Lightweight Polygon Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14723v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an effective and reliable pose tracking solution, termed ERPoT, for mobile robots operating in large-scale outdoor and challenging indoor environments, underpinned by an innovative prior polygon map. Especially, to overcome the challenge that arises as the map size grows with the expansion of the environment, the novel form of a prior map composed of multiple polygons is proposed. Benefiting from the use of polygons to concisely and accurately depict environmental occupancy, the prior polygon map achieves long-term reliable pose tracking while ensuring a compact form. More importantly, pose tracking is carried out under pure LiDAR mode, and the dense 3D point cloud is transformed into a sparse 2D scan through ground removal and obstacle selection. On this basis, a novel cost function for pose estimation through point-polygon matching is introduced, encompassing two distinct constraint forms: point-to-vertex and point-to-edge. In this study, our primary focus lies on two crucial aspects: lightweight and compact prior map construction, as well as effective and reliable robot pose tracking. Both aspects serve as the foundational pillars for future navigation across diverse mobile platforms equipped with different LiDAR sensors in varied environments. Comparative experiments based on the publicly available datasets and our self-recorded datasets are conducted, and evaluation results show the superior performance of ERPoT on reliability, prior map size, pose estimation error, and runtime over the other six approaches.

Observers based on proprioceptive information can be used for contact detection but have first-order error dynamics, which results in delays. Sensor fusion based on inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of accelerometers and gyroscopes is advantageous for reducing delays. The acceleration estimation enables the direct calculation of external forces. For serial robots, the installation of multiple accelerometers and gyroscopes is required for dynamics modeling since the joint coordinates are the minimal coordinates. Alternatively, parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential to use only one IMU on the end-effector platform, which already presents the minimal coordinates of the PR. This work introduces a sensor-fusion method for contact detection using encoders and only one low-cost, consumer-grade IMU for a PR. The end-effector accelerations are estimated by an extended Kalman filter and incorporated into the dynamics to calculate external forces. In real-world experiments with a planar PR, we demonstrate that this approach reduces the detection duration by up to 50% compared to a momentum observer and enables the collision and clamping detection within 3-39ms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of a publication accepted for IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

However, two issues need to be considered when applying it in field environments: one is resource limitation, and the other is inter/intra-robot association. The resource limitation issue arises when the data size exceeds the processing capacity of the network or memory, especially when utilizing communication systems or onboard computers in the field. The inter/intra-robot association issue occurs due to the narrow convergence region of ICP under large viewpoint differences, triggering many false positive loops and ultimately resulting in an inconsistent global map for multi-robot systems. To tackle these problems, we propose a distributed LiDAR SLAM framework designed for versatile field applications, called SKiD-SLAM. Extending our previous work that solely focused on lightweight place recognition and fast and robust global registration, we present a multi-robot mapping framework that focuses on robust and lightweight inter-robot loop closure in distributed LiDAR SLAM. Through various environmental experiments, we demonstrate that our method is more robust and lightweight compared to other state-of-the-art distributed SLAM approaches, overcoming resource limitation and inter/intra-robot association issues. Also, we validated the field applicability of our approach through mapping experiments in real-world planetary emulation terrain and cave environments, which are in-house datasets. Our code will be available at https://sparolab.github.io/research/skid_slam/.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Rethink Repeatable Measures of Robot Performance with Statistical Query](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08216v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For a general standardized testing algorithm designed to evaluate a specific aspect of a robot's performance, several key expectations are commonly imposed. Beyond accuracy (i.e., closeness to a typically unknown ground-truth reference) and efficiency (i.e., feasibility within acceptable testing costs and equipment constraints), one particularly important attribute is repeatability. Repeatability refers to the ability to consistently obtain the same testing outcome when similar testing algorithms are executed on the same subject robot by different stakeholders, across different times or locations. However, achieving repeatable testing has become increasingly challenging as the components involved grow more complex, intelligent, diverse, and, most importantly, stochastic. While related efforts have addressed repeatability at ethical, hardware, and procedural levels, this study focuses specifically on repeatable testing at the algorithmic level. Specifically, we target the well-adopted class of testing algorithms in standardized evaluation: statistical query (SQ) algorithms (i.e., algorithms that estimate the expected value of a bounded function over a distribution using sampled data). We propose a lightweight, parameterized, and adaptive modification applicable to any SQ routine, whether based on Monte Carlo sampling, importance sampling, or adaptive importance sampling, that makes it provably repeatable, with guaranteed bounds on both accuracy and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across three representative scenarios: (i) established and widely adopted standardized testing of manipulators, (ii) emerging intelligent testing algorithms for operational risk assessment in automated vehicles, and (iii) developing use cases involving command tracking performance evaluation of humanoid robots in locomotion tasks.</p></details> |  |

Current BC approaches often enhance generalization by leveraging large datasets and incorporating additional visual and textual modalities to capture more diverse information. However, these methods overlook whether the learned representations contain redundant information and lack a solid theoretical foundation to guide the learning process. To address these limitations, we adopt an information-theoretic perspective and introduce mutual information to quantify and mitigate redundancy in latent representations. Building on this, we incorporate the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle into BC, which extends the idea of reducing redundancy by providing a structured framework for compressing irrelevant information while preserving task-relevant features. This work presents the first comprehensive study on redundancy in latent representations across various methods, backbones, and experimental settings, while extending the generalizability of the IB to BC. Extensive experiments and analyses on the CortexBench and LIBERO benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements with IB, underscoring the importance of reducing input data redundancy and highlighting its practical value for more practical applications.

However, existing neural architectures that support heterogeneous teaming tend to force a trade-off between expressivity and efficiency. Shared-parameter designs prioritize sample efficiency by enabling a single network to be shared across all or a pre-specified subset of robots (via input augmentations), but tend to limit behavioral diversity. In contrast, recent designs employ a separate policy for each robot, enabling greater diversity and expressivity at the cost of efficiency and generalization. Our key insight is that such tradeoffs can be avoided by viewing these design choices as ends of a broad spectrum. Inspired by recent work in transfer and meta learning, and building on prior work in multi-robot task allocation, we propose Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks (CASH), a soft weight sharing architecture that uses hypernetworks to efficiently learn a flexible shared policy that dynamically adapts to each robot post-training. By explicitly encoding the impact of robot capabilities (e.g., speed and payload) on collective behavior, CASH enables zero-shot generalization to unseen robots or team compositions. Our experiments involve multiple heterogeneous tasks, three learning paradigms (imitation learning, value-based, and policy-gradient RL), and SOTA multi-robot simulation (JaxMARL) and hardware (Robotarium) platforms. Across all conditions, we find that CASH generates appropriately-diverse behaviors and consistently outperforms baseline architectures in terms of performance and sample efficiency during both training and zero-shot generalization, all with 60%-80% fewer learnable parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, equal authorship between Kevin Fu and Shalin Anand Jain</p></details> |

We propose a novel hybrid geometric-neural approach for autonomous leaf grasping that combines traditional computer vision with neural networks through self-supervised learning. Our method integrates YOLOv8 for instance segmentation and RAFT-Stereo for 3D depth estimation to build rich leaf representations, which feed into both a geometric feature scoring pipeline and a neural refinement module (GraspPointCNN). The key innovation is our confidence-weighted fusion mechanism that dynamically balances the contribution of each approach based on prediction certainty. Our self-supervised framework uses the geometric pipeline as an expert teacher to automatically generate training data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves an 88.0% success rate in controlled environments and 84.7% in real greenhouse conditions, significantly outperforming both purely geometric (75.3%) and neural (60.2%) methods. This work establishes a new paradigm for agricultural robotics where domain expertise is seamlessly integrated with machine learning capabilities, providing a foundation for fully automated crop monitoring systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[What Matters for Batch Online Reinforcement Learning in Robotics?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08078v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to learn from large batches of autonomously collected data for policy improvement -- a paradigm we refer to as batch online reinforcement learning -- holds the promise of enabling truly scalable robot learning by significantly reducing the need for human effort of data collection while getting benefits from self-improvement. Yet, despite the promise of this paradigm, it remains challenging to achieve due to algorithms not being able to learn effectively from the autonomous data. For example, prior works have applied imitation learning and filtered imitation learning methods to the batch online RL problem, but these algorithms often fail to efficiently improve from the autonomously collected data or converge quickly to a suboptimal point. This raises the question of what matters for effective batch online RL in robotics. Motivated by this question, we perform a systematic empirical study of three axes -- (i) algorithm class, (ii) policy extraction methods, and (iii) policy expressivity -- and analyze how these axes affect performance and scaling with the amount of autonomous data. Through our analysis, we make several observations. First, we observe that the use of Q-functions to guide batch online RL significantly improves performance over imitation-based methods. Building on this, we show that an implicit method of policy extraction -- via choosing the best action in the distribution of the policy -- is necessary over traditional policy extraction methods from offline RL. Next, we show that an expressive policy class is preferred over less expressive policy classes. Based on this analysis, we propose a general recipe for effective batch online RL. We then show a simple addition to the recipe of using temporally-correlated noise to obtain more diversity results in further performance gains. Our recipe obtains significantly better performance and scaling compared to prior methods.</p></details> |  |

This integration presents both unprecedented opportunities and notable challenges for effective collaboration. However, the active guidance of human actions and their integration in co-learning processes, where humans and robots mutually learn from each other, remains under-explored. This article demonstrates how consensus between human and robot opinions can be established by modeling decision-making processes as non-linear opinion dynamics. We utilize dynamic bias as a control parameter to steer the robot's opinion toward consensus and employ visual cues via a robotic eye gaze to guide human decisions. These non-verbal cues communicate the robot's future intentions, gradually guiding human decisions to align with them. To design robot behavior for consensus, we integrate a human opinion observation algorithm with the robot's opinion formation, controlling its actions based on that formed opinion. Experiments with $51$ participants ($N=51$) in a two-choice decision-making task show that effective consensus and trust can be established in a human--robot co-learning setting by guiding human decisions through nonverbal robotic cues and using bias-controlled opinion dynamics to shape robot behavior. Finally, we provide detailed information on the perceived cognitive load and the behavior of robotic eyes based on user feedback and post-experiment interviews.</p></details> | 48 pages, 8 figures |

However, controlling their behavior is challenging due to their nonlinear material response and infinite degrees of freedom. A potential solution to these challenges is to discretize the infinite-dimensional configuration space into a finite but sufficiently large number of functional modes with programmed dynamics. We present a strategy for co-designing the desired tasks and morphology of pneumatically actuated soft robots with multiple encoded stable states and dynamic responses. Our approach introduces a general method to capture the soft robots' response using an energy-based analytical model, the parameters of which are obtained using Recursive Feature Elimination. The resulting lumped-parameter model facilitates inverse co-design of the robot's morphology and planned tasks by embodying specific dynamics upon actuation.

| **[Pixel Motion as Universal Representation for Robot Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07817v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present LangToMo, a vision-language-action framework structured as a dual-system architecture that uses pixel motion forecasts as intermediate representations. Our high-level System 2, an image diffusion model, generates text-conditioned pixel motion sequences from a single frame to guide robot control. Pixel motion-a universal, interpretable, and motion-centric representation-can be extracted from videos in a self-supervised manner, enabling diffusion model training on web-scale video-caption data. Treating generated pixel motion as learned universal representations, our low level System 1 module translates these into robot actions via motion-to-action mapping functions, which can be either hand-crafted or learned with minimal supervision. System 2 operates as a high-level policy applied at sparse temporal intervals, while System 1 acts as a low-level policy at dense temporal intervals. This hierarchical decoupling enables flexible, scalable, and generalizable robot control under both unsupervised and supervised settings, bridging the gap between language, motion, and action.

While teleoperation provides high-fidelity datasets, its high cost limits its scalability. Instead, what if people could use their own hands, just as they do in everyday life, to collect data? In DexWild, a diverse team of data collectors uses their hands to collect hours of interactions across a multitude of environments and objects. To record this data, we create DexWild-System, a low-cost, mobile, and easy-to-use device. The DexWild learning framework co-trains on both human and robot demonstrations, leading to improved performance compared to training on each dataset individually. This combination results in robust robot policies capable of generalizing to novel environments, tasks, and embodiments with minimal additional robot-specific data. Experimental results demonstrate that DexWild significantly improves performance, achieving a 68.5% success rate in unseen environments-nearly four times higher than policies trained with robot data only-and offering 5.8x better cross-embodiment generalization.

However, its traditional implementation as a singular static unit limits its dynamic range and application versatility. This paper introduces AcoustoBots - a novel convergence of acoustophoresis with a movable and reconfigurable phased array of transducers for enhanced application versatility. We mount a phased array of transducers on a swarm of robots to harness the benefits of multiple mobile acoustophoretic units. This offers a more flexible and interactive platform that enables a swarm of acoustophoretic multimodal interactions. Our novel AcoustoBots design includes a hinge actuation system that controls the orientation of the mounted phased array of transducers to achieve high flexibility in a swarm of acoustophoretic multimodal interactions. In addition, we designed a BeadDispenserBot that can deliver particles to trapping locations, which automates the acoustic levitation interaction. These attributes allow AcoustoBots to independently work for a common cause and interchange between modalities, allowing for novel augmentations (e.g., a swarm of haptics, audio, and levitation) and bilateral interactions with users in an expanded interaction area. We detail our design considerations, challenges, and methodological approach to extend acoustophoretic central control in distributed settings. This work demonstrates a scalable acoustic control framework with two mobile robots, laying the groundwork for future deployment in larger robotic swarms. Finally, we characterize the performance of our AcoustoBots and explore the potential interactive scenarios they can enable.</p></details> |  |

However, many robotic downstream tasks require the use of cameras, which may raise privacy risks. To better understand user perceptions of privacy in relation to visual data, we conducted a user study investigating how different image modalities and image resolutions affect users' privacy concerns. The results show that depth images are broadly viewed as privacy-safe, and a similarly high proportion of respondents feel the same about semantic segmentation images. Additionally, the majority of participants consider 32*32 resolution RGB images to be almost sufficiently privacy-preserving, while most believe that 16*16 resolution can fully guarantee privacy protection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Control Strategies for Safe and Adaptive Robot-Assisted Dressing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07710v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety, reliability, and user trust are crucial in human-robot interaction (HRI) where the robots must address hazards in real-time. This study presents hazard driven low-level control strategies implemented in robot-assisted dressing (RAD) scenarios where hazards like garment snags and user discomfort in real-time can affect task performance and user safety. The proposed control mechanisms include: (1) Garment Snagging Control Strategy, which detects excessive forces and either seeks user intervention via a chatbot or autonomously adjusts its trajectory, and (2) User Discomfort/Pain Mitigation Strategy, which dynamically reduces velocity based on user feedback and aborts the task if necessary. We used physical dressing trials in order to evaluate these control strategies. Results confirm that integrating force monitoring with user feedback improves safety and task continuity. The findings emphasise the need for hybrid approaches that balance autonomous intervention, user involvement, and controlled task termination, supported by bi-directional interaction and real-time user-driven adaptability, paving the way for more responsive and personalised HRI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intuitive Human-Robot Interfaces Leveraging on Autonomy Features for the Control of Highly-redundant Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07668v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>[...] With the TelePhysicalOperation interface, the user can teleoperate the different capabilities of a robot (e.g., single/double arm manipulation, wheel/leg locomotion) by applying virtual forces on selected robot body parts. This approach emulates the intuitiveness of physical human-robot interaction, but at the same time it permits to teleoperate the robot from a safe distance, in a way that resembles a "Marionette" interface. The system is further enhanced with wearable haptic feedback functions to align better with the "Marionette" metaphor, and a user study has been conducted to validate its efficacy with and without the haptic channel enabled. Considering the importance of robot independence, the TelePhysicalOperation interface incorporates autonomy modules to face, for example, the teleoperation of dual-arm mobile base robots for bimanual object grasping and transportation tasks. With the laser-guided interface, the user can indicate points of interest to the robot through the utilization of a simple but effective laser emitter device. With a neural network-based vision system, the robot tracks the laser projection in real time, allowing the user to indicate not only fixed goals, like objects, but also paths to follow. With the implemented autonomous behavior, a mobile manipulator employs its locomanipulation abilities to follow the indicated goals. The behavior is modeled using Behavior Trees, exploiting their reactivity to promptly respond to changes in goal positions, and their modularity to adapt the motion planning to the task needs. The proposed laser interface has also been employed in an assistive scenario. In this case, users with upper limbs impairments can control an assistive manipulator by directing a head-worn laser emitter to the point of interests, to collaboratively address activities of everyday life.

In contrast, humans are able to learn efficiently by watching others interact with their environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce semantic action flow as a core intermediate representation capturing the essential spatio-temporal manipulator-object interactions, invariant to superficial visual differences. We present ViSA-Flow, a framework that learns this representation self-supervised from unlabeled large-scale video data. First, a generative model is pre-trained on semantic action flows automatically extracted from large-scale human-object interaction video data, learning a robust prior over manipulation structure. Second, this prior is efficiently adapted to a target robot by fine-tuning on a small set of robot demonstrations processed through the same semantic abstraction pipeline. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the CALVIN benchmark and real-world tasks that ViSA-Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in low-data regimes, outperforming prior methods by effectively transferring knowledge from human video observation to robotic execution. Videos are available at https://visaflow-web.github.io/ViSAFLOW.</p></details> |  |

Given the limited battery of robots, especially for aerial vehicles, we allow for robot recharges and the possibility of fragmenting and/or relaying certain tasks. We also address tasks that must be performed by a coalition of robots in a coordinated manner. Given these features, we introduce a new class of heterogeneous MRTA problems which we analyze theoretically and optimally formulate as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program. We then contribute a heuristic algorithm to compute approximate solutions and integrate it into a mission planning and execution architecture capable of reacting to unexpected events by repairing or recomputing plans online. Our experimental results show the relevance of our newly formulated problem in a realistic use case for inspection with aerial robots. We assess the performance of our heuristic solver in comparison with other variants and with exact optimal solutions in small-scale scenarios. In addition, we evaluate the ability of our replanning framework to repair plans online.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

However, most existing target person tracking (TPT) benchmarks are limited to controlled laboratory environments with few distractions, clean backgrounds, and short-term occlusions. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoptic, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 35 sequences, both indoors and outdoors. Using this dataset and visual annotations, we perform extensive experiments with existing TPT methods, offering a thorough analysis of their limitations and suggesting future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. web: https://medlartea.github.io/tpt-bench/</p></details> |

However, they continue to experience crippling long-tail latency spikes whenever bursty request streams exceed the capacity of heterogeneous edge and cloud tiers. To address these long-tail latency issues, we present Latency-Aware, Predictive In-Memory Routing and Proactive Autoscaling (LA-IMR). This control layer integrates a closed-form, utilization-driven latency model with event-driven scheduling, replica autoscaling, and edge-to-cloud offloading to mitigate 99th-percentile (P99) delays. Our analytic model decomposes end-to-end latency into processing, network, and queuing components, expressing inference latency as an affine power-law function of instance utilization. Once calibrated, it produces two complementary functions that drive: (i) millisecond-scale routing decisions for traffic offloading, and (ii) capacity planning that jointly determines replica pool sizes. LA-IMR enacts these decisions through a quality-differentiated, multi-queue scheduler and a custom-metric Kubernetes autoscaler that scales replicas proactively -- before queues build up -- rather than reactively based on lagging CPU metrics. Across representative vision workloads (YOLOv5m and EfficientDet) and bursty arrival traces, LA-IMR reduces P99 latency by up to 20.7 percent compared to traditional latency-only autoscaling, laying a principled foundation for next-generation, tail-tolerant cloud-edge inference services.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, the variable quality of training data often constrains the performance of these models. On the other hand, offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at learning robust policy models from mixed-quality data. In this paper, we introduce Reinforced robot GPT (ReinboT), a novel end-to-end VLA model that integrates the RL principle of maximizing cumulative reward. ReinboT achieves a deeper understanding of the data quality distribution by predicting dense returns that capture the nuances of manipulation tasks. The dense return prediction capability enables the robot to generate more robust decision-making actions, oriented towards maximizing future benefits. Extensive experiments show that ReinboT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CALVIN mixed-quality dataset and exhibits superior few-shot learning and out-of-distribution generalization capabilities in real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality-enhanced Decision-Making for Autonomous Mobile Robots in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11901v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing integration of robots in shared environments -- such as warehouses, shopping centres, and hospitals -- demands a deep understanding of the underlying dynamics and human behaviours, including how, when, and where individuals engage in various activities and interactions. This knowledge goes beyond simple correlation studies and requires a more comprehensive causal analysis. By leveraging causal inference to model cause-and-effect relationships, we can better anticipate critical environmental factors and enable autonomous robots to plan and execute tasks more effectively. To this end, we propose a novel causality-based decision-making framework that reasons over a learned causal model to predict battery usage and human obstructions, understanding how these factors could influence robot task execution. Such reasoning framework assists the robot in deciding when and how to complete a given task. To achieve this, we developed also PeopleFlow, a new Gazebo-based simulator designed to model context-sensitive human-robot spatial interactions in shared workspaces. PeopleFlow features realistic human and robot trajectories influenced by contextual factors such as time, environment layout, and robot state, and can simulate a large number of agents. While the simulator is general-purpose, in this paper we focus on a warehouse-like environment as a case study, where we conduct an extensive evaluation benchmarking our causal approach against a non-causal baseline. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solutions, highlighting how causal reasoning enables autonomous robots to operate more efficiently and safely in dynamic environments shared with humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Causa...</summary><p>Causal Discovery and Inference - Robot Autonomy - Human-Robot Spatial Interaction - Decision-Making</p></details> |

The intrinsic ability to adjust the stiffness during the execution of the task enables the CDPRs to effectively meet above-mentioned requirements.

| **[Autonomous Robotic Pruning in Orchards and Vineyards: a Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07318v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manual pruning is labor intensive and represents up to 25% of annual labor costs in fruit production, notably in apple orchards and vineyards where operational challenges and cost constraints limit the adoption of large-scale machinery. In response, a growing body of research is investigating compact, flexible robotic platforms capable of precise pruning in varied terrains, particularly where traditional mechanization falls short. This paper reviews recent advances in autonomous robotic pruning for orchards and vineyards, addressing a critical need in precision agriculture. Our review examines literature published between 2014 and 2024, focusing on innovative contributions across key system components. Special attention is given to recent developments in machine vision, perception, plant skeletonization, and control strategies, areas that have experienced significant influence from advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The analysis situates these technological trends within broader agricultural challenges, including rising labor costs, a decline in the number of young farmers, and the diverse pruning requirements of different fruit species such as apple, grapevine, and cherry trees. By comparing various robotic architectures and methodologies, this survey not only highlights the progress made toward autonomous pruning but also identifies critical open challenges and future research directions. The findings underscore the potential of robotic systems to bridge the gap between manual and mechanized operations, paving the way for more efficient, sustainable, and precise agricultural practices.</p></details> |  |

However, relying on hand-crafted prior knowledge about the geometric structure of the object fails when generalising to unseen objects, and depth sensors fail to detect transparent objects such as drinking glasses. In this work, we propose a stereo-based method for hand-object reconstruction that combines single-view reconstructions probabilistically to form a coherent stereo reconstruction. We learn 3D shape priors from a large synthetic hand-object dataset to ensure that our method is generalisable, and use RGB inputs to better capture transparent objects. We show that our method reduces the object Chamfer distance compared to existing RGB based hand-object reconstruction methods on single view and stereo settings. We process the reconstructed hand-object shape with a projection-based outlier removal step and use the output to guide a human-to-robot handover pipeline with wide-baseline stereo RGB cameras. Our hand-object reconstruction enables a robot to successfully receive a diverse range of household objects from the human.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 1 table.

It holds particular promise for soft robots, which are amenable to novel manufacturing techniques that can realize learned morphologies and actuators. Inspired by nature and recent novel robot designs, we propose to go a step further and explore the novel reconfigurable robots, defined as robots that can change their morphology within their lifetime. We formalize control of reconfigurable soft robots as a high-dimensional reinforcement learning (RL) problem. We unify morphology change, locomotion, and environment interaction in the same action space, and introduce an appropriate, coarse-to-fine curriculum that enables us to discover policies that accomplish fine-grained control of the resulting robots. We also introduce DittoGym, a comprehensive RL benchmark for reconfigurable soft robots that require fine-grained morphology changes to accomplish the tasks. Finally, we evaluate our proposed coarse-to-fine algorithm on DittoGym and demonstrate robots that learn to change their morphology several times within a sequence, uniquely enabled by our RL algorithm.

Our system enables users to visualize robot perception outputs such as object detection and segmentation results using a MR device. Therefore, users can inspect failures of perception models using the system on real robots. Moreover, iTeach facilitates real-time, informed data collection and annotation, where users can use hand gesture, eye gaze and voice commands to annotate images collected from robots. The annotated images can be used to fine-tune perception models to improve their accuracy and adaptability. The system continually improves perception models by collecting annotations of failed examples from users. When applied to object detection and unseen object instance segmentation (UOIS) tasks, iTeach demonstrates encouraging results in improving pre-trained vision models for these two tasks. These results highlight the potential of MR to make robotic perception systems more capable and adaptive in real-world environments.

Recent advances have made significant progress in high-level cognition with Foundation Models (FMs) and low-level skill development for humanoid robots. However, directly combining these components often results in poor robustness and efficiency due to compounding errors in long-horizon tasks and the varied latency of different modules. We introduce Being-0, a hierarchical agent framework that integrates an FM with a modular skill library. The FM handles high-level cognitive tasks such as instruction understanding, task planning, and reasoning, while the skill library provides stable locomotion and dexterous manipulation for low-level control. To bridge the gap between these levels, we propose a novel Connector module, powered by a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). The Connector enhances the FM's embodied capabilities by translating language-based plans into actionable skill commands and dynamically coordinating locomotion and manipulation to improve task success. With all components, except the FM, deployable on low-cost onboard computation devices, Being-0 achieves efficient, real-time performance on a full-sized humanoid robot equipped with dexterous hands and active vision. Extensive experiments in large indoor environments demonstrate Being-0's effectiveness in solving complex, long-horizon tasks that require challenging navigation and manipulation subtasks.

ML models, especially artificial neural networks (ANNs), can provide advanced decision-making and control capabilities by learning from data. However, they often function as black boxes, making it challenging to interpret them. This is especially a problem in safety-critical control applications. To generate realistic CFEs, we parameterize the LiDAR space with simple shapes such as circles and rectangles, whose parameters are chosen by a genetic algorithm, and the configurations are transformed into LiDAR data by raycasting. Our model-agnostic approach generates CFEs in the form of synthetic LiDAR data that resembles a base LiDAR state but is modified to produce a pre-defined ML model control output based on a query from the user. We demonstrate our method on a mobile robot, the TurtleBot3, controlled using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in real-world and simulated scenarios. Our method generates logical and realistic CFEs, which helps to interpret the DRL agent's decision making. This paper contributes towards advancing explainable AI in mobile robotics, and our method could be a tool for understanding, debugging, and improving ML-based autonomous control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2025 European Control Conference (ECC)</p></details> |
| **[FACET: Force-Adaptive Control via Impedance Reference Tracking for Legged Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06883v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant strides in legged robot control, enabling locomotion across diverse terrains and complex loco-manipulation capabilities. However, the commonly used position or velocity tracking-based objectives are agnostic to forces experienced by the robot, leading to stiff and potentially dangerous behaviors and poor control during forceful interactions. To address this limitation, we present \emph{Force-Adaptive Control via Impedance Reference Tracking} (FACET). Inspired by impedance control, we use RL to train a control policy to imitate a virtual mass-spring-damper system, allowing fine-grained control under external forces by manipulating the virtual spring. In simulation, we demonstrate that our quadruped robot achieves improved robustness to large impulses (up to 200 Ns) and exhibits controllable compliance, achieving an 80% reduction in collision impulse. The policy is deployed to a physical robot to showcase both compliance and the ability to engage with large forces by kinesthetic control and pulling payloads up to 2/3 of its weight. Further extension to a legged loco-manipulator and a humanoid shows the applicability of our method to more complex settings to enable whole-body compliance control.

| **[Efficient Robotic Policy Learning via Latent Space Backward Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06861v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current robotic planning methods often rely on predicting multi-frame images with full pixel details. While this fine-grained approach can serve as a generic world model, it introduces two significant challenges for downstream policy learning: substantial computational costs that hinder real-time deployment, and accumulated inaccuracies that can mislead action extraction. Planning with coarse-grained subgoals partially alleviates efficiency issues. However, their forward planning schemes can still result in off-task predictions due to accumulation errors, leading to misalignment with long-term goals. This raises a critical question: Can robotic planning be both efficient and accurate enough for real-time control in long-horizon, multi-stage tasks? To address this, we propose a Latent Space Backward Planning scheme (LBP), which begins by grounding the task into final latent goals, followed by recursively predicting intermediate subgoals closer to the current state. The grounded final goal enables backward subgoal planning to always remain aware of task completion, facilitating on-task prediction along the entire planning horizon. The subgoal-conditioned policy incorporates a learnable token to summarize the subgoal sequences and determines how each subgoal guides action extraction. Through extensive simulation and real-robot long-horizon experiments, we show that LBP outperforms existing fine-grained and forward planning methods, achieving SOTA performance.

The proposed framework integrates a robust state estimator capable of accurately reconstructing neighboring agents' velocity vectors and orientations under varying dynamic conditions, with a decentralized formation tracking controller that leverages Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to guarantee collision avoidance and inter-agent safety. We present a closed-form control law that ensures both stability and string stability, effectively attenuating disturbances propagating from leader to followers. The theoretical foundations of the estimator and controller are established using Lyapunov stability analysis, which confirms global asymptotic stability under constant velocities and global uniformly ultimate boundedness under time-varying conditions. Extensive numerical simulations and realistic Gazebo-based experiments validate the effectiveness, robustness, and practical applicability of the proposed method, demonstrating precise formation tracking, stringent safety maintenance, and disturbance resilience without relying on inter-robot communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

However, established MARL platforms (e.g., SMAC and MPE) lack robotics relevance and hardware deployment, leaving multi-robot learning researchers to develop bespoke environments and hardware testbeds dedicated to the development and evaluation of their individual contributions. The Multi-Agent RL Benchmark and Learning Environment for the Robotarium (MARBLER) is an exciting recent step in providing a standardized robotics-relevant platform for MARL, by bridging the Robotarium testbed with existing MARL software infrastructure. However, MARBLER lacks support for parallelization and GPU/TPU execution, making the platform prohibitively slow compared to modern MARL environments and hindering adoption. We contribute JaxRobotarium, a Jax-powered end-to-end simulation, learning, deployment, and benchmarking platform for the Robotarium. JaxRobotarium enables rapid training and deployment of multi-robot reinforcement learning (MRRL) policies with realistic robot dynamics and safety constraints, supporting both parallelization and hardware acceleration. Our generalizable learning interface provides an easy-to-use integration with SOTA MARL libraries (e.g., JaxMARL).

| **[HAMSTER: Hierarchical Action Models For Open-World Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05485v4)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is the lack of robotic data, which are typically obtained through expensive on-robot operation. A promising remedy is to leverage cheaper, off-domain data such as action-free videos, hand-drawn sketches or simulation data. In this work, we posit that hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) models can be more effective in utilizing off-domain data than standard monolithic VLA models that directly finetune vision-language models (VLMs) to predict actions. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA models, where the high-level VLM is finetuned to produce a coarse 2D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory given an RGB image and a task description. The intermediate 2D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Doing so alleviates the high-level VLM from fine-grained action prediction, while reducing the low-level policy's burden on complex task-level reasoning. We show that, with the hierarchical design, the high-level VLM can transfer across significant domain gaps between the off-domain finetuning data and real-robot testing scenarios, including differences on embodiments, dynamics, visual appearances and task semantics, etc. In the real-robot experiments, we observe an average of 20% improvement in success rate across seven different axes of generalization over OpenVLA, representing a 50% relative gain.

However, network intrusion to IoRT can lead to data leakage, service interruption in IoRT and even physical damage by controlling robots or vehicles. This paper proposes a Contrastive Federated Semi-Supervised Learning Network Intrusion Detection framework (CFedSSL-NID) for IoRT intrusion detection and defense, to address the practical scenario of IoRT where robots don't possess labeled data locally and the requirement for data privacy preserving. CFedSSL-NID integrates randomly weak and strong augmentation, latent contrastive learning, and EMA update to integrate supervised signals, thereby enhancing performance and robustness on robots' local unlabeled data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CFedSSL-NID outperforms existing federated semi-supervised and fully supervised methods on benchmark dataset and has lower resource requirements.</p></details> |  |

Although prior work has demonstrated skateboarding for quadrupeds that are already positioned on the board, the initial mounting phase still poses a significant challenge. A goal-oriented methodology was adopted, beginning with the terminal phases of the task and progressively increasing the complexity of the problem definition to approximate the desired objective. The learning process was initiated with the skateboard rigidly fixed within the global coordinate frame and the robot positioned directly above it. Through gradual relaxation of these initial conditions, the learned policy demonstrated robustness to variations in skateboard position and orientation, ultimately exhibiting a successful transfer to scenarios involving a mobile skateboard. The code, trained models, and reproducible examples are available at the following link: https://github.com/dancher00/quadruped-skateboard-mounting</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-RT: Learning Language-Conditioned Robotic Policies from Natural Language Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00508v4)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teaching robots desired skills in real-world environments remains challenging, especially for non-experts. A key bottleneck is that collecting robotic data often requires expertise or specialized hardware, limiting accessibility and scalability. We posit that natural language offers an intuitive and accessible interface for robot learning. To this end, we study two aspects: (1) enabling non-experts to collect robotic data through natural language supervision (e.g., "move the arm to the right") and (2) training robot policies directly from this supervision. Specifically, we introduce a data collection framework that collects robot demonstrations based on natural language supervision and further augments these demonstrations. We then present CLIP-RT, a new vision-language-action (VLA) model that learns language-conditioned visuomotor policies from this supervision. CLIP-RT adapts the pretrained CLIP model and learns to predict language-based motion primitives via contrastive imitation learning. We train CLIP-RT on the Open X-Embodiment dataset and finetune it on in-domain data collected by our framework. In real-world evaluations, CLIP-RT demonstrates strong capabilities in learning novel manipulation skills, outperforming OpenVLA (7B parameters) by 24% in average success rates, while using 7x fewer parameters (1B). We further assess CLIP-RT's capabilities in few-shot generalization and collaborative scenarios involving large pretrained models or humans. In simulated environments, CLIP-RT also yields strong performance, achieving a 93.1% average success rate on the LIBERO benchmark with an inference throughput of 163 Hz.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RSS 2025.

Inspired by these developments, researchers have begun exploring the use of LLMs as decentralized decision-makers for multi-robot formation control. However, prior studies reveal that directly applying LLMs to such tasks often leads to unstable and inconsistent behaviors, where robots may collapse to the centroid of their positions or diverge entirely due to hallucinated reasoning, logical inconsistencies, and limited coordination awareness. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework that integrates LLMs with an influence-based plan consensus protocol. In this framework, each robot independently generates a local plan toward the desired formation using its own LLM. The robots then iteratively refine their plans through a decentralized consensus protocol that accounts for their influence on neighboring robots. This process drives the system toward a coherent and stable flocking formation in a fully decentralized manner. We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulations involving both state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs (e.g., o3-mini, Claude 3.5) and open-source models (e.g., Llama3.1-405b, Qwen-Max, DeepSeek-R1). The results show notable improvements in stability, convergence, and adaptability over previous LLM-based methods. We further validate our framework on a physical team of Crazyflie drones, demonstrating its practical viability and effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems.</p></details> |  |

This becomes particularly challenging in perception-degraded subterranean conditions under harsh environmental factors, including darkness, dust, and geometrically self-similar structures. This paper details CompSLAM, a highly resilient and hierarchical multi-modal localization and mapping framework designed to address these challenges. Its flexible architecture achieves resilience through redundancy by leveraging the complementary nature of pose estimates derived from diverse sensor modalities. Developed during the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, CompSLAM was successfully deployed on all aerial, legged, and wheeled robots of Team Cerberus during their competition-winning final run. Furthermore, it has proven to be a reliable odometry and mapping solution in various subsequent projects, with extensions enabling multi-robot map sharing for marsupial robotic deployments and collaborative mapping. This paper also introduces a comprehensive dataset acquired by a manually teleoperated quadrupedal robot, covering a significant portion of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge finals course. This dataset evaluates CompSLAM's robustness to sensor degradations as the robot traverses 740 meters in an environment characterized by highly variable geometries and demanding lighting conditions. The CompSLAM code and the DARPA SubT Finals dataset are made publicly available for the benefit of the robotics community</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, Code: https://github.com/leggedrobotics/compslam_subt</p></details> |
| **[ELEMENTAL: Interactive Learning from Demonstrations and Vision-Language Models for Reward Design in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18825v3)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated compelling performance in robotic tasks, but its success often hinges on the design of complex, ad hoc reward functions. Researchers have explored how Large Language Models (LLMs) could enable non-expert users to specify reward functions more easily. However, LLMs struggle to balance the importance of different features, generalize poorly to out-of-distribution robotic tasks, and cannot represent the problem properly with only text-based descriptions. To address these challenges, we propose ELEMENTAL (intEractive LEarning froM dEmoNstraTion And Language), a novel framework that combines natural language guidance with visual user demonstrations to align robot behavior with user intentions better. By incorporating visual inputs, ELEMENTAL overcomes the limitations of text-only task specifications, while leveraging inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to balance feature weights and match the demonstrated behaviors optimally. ELEMENTAL also introduces an iterative feedback-loop through self-reflection to improve feature, reward, and policy learning. Our experiment results demonstrate that ELEMENTAL outperforms prior work by 42.3% on task success, and achieves 41.3% better generalization in out-of-distribution tasks, highlighting its robustness in LfD.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Vision-language-action (VLA) models, in particular, have emerged as a promising approach for visuomotor control by leveraging large-scale vision-language data and robot demonstrations. However, current VLA models are typically evaluated using a limited set of hand-crafted scenes, leaving their general performance and robustness in diverse scenarios largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present VLATest, a fuzzing framework designed to generate robotic manipulation scenes for testing VLA models. Based on VLATest, we conducted an empirical study to assess the performance of seven representative VLA models. Our study results revealed that current VLA models lack the robustness necessary for practical deployment. Additionally, we investigated the impact of various factors, including the number of confounding objects, lighting conditions, camera poses, unseen objects, and task instruction mutations, on the VLA model's performance. Our findings highlight the limitations of existing VLA models, emphasizing the need for further research to develop reliable and trustworthy VLA applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in FSE '25 (Proceedings of ACM Software Engineering, Vol. 2, Issue FSE, Article FSE073), 24 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[DAPPER: Discriminability-Aware Policy-to-Policy Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning for Query-Efficient Robot Skill Acquisition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06357v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) enables policy learning through simple queries comparing trajectories from a single policy. While human responses to these queries make it possible to learn policies aligned with human preferences, PbRL suffers from low query efficiency, as policy bias limits trajectory diversity and reduces the number of discriminable queries available for learning preferences. This paper identifies preference discriminability, which quantifies how easily a human can judge which trajectory is closer to their ideal behavior, as a key metric for improving query efficiency. To address this, we move beyond comparisons within a single policy and instead generate queries by comparing trajectories from multiple policies, as training them from scratch promotes diversity without policy bias. We propose Discriminability-Aware Policy-to-Policy Preference-Based Efficient Reinforcement Learning (DAPPER), which integrates preference discriminability with trajectory diversification achieved by multiple policies. DAPPER trains new policies from scratch after each reward update and employs a discriminator that learns to estimate preference discriminability, enabling the prioritized sampling of more discriminable queries. During training, it jointly maximizes the preference reward and preference discriminability score, encouraging the discovery of highly rewarding and easily distinguishable policies. Experiments in simulated and real-world legged robot environments demonstrate that DAPPER outperforms previous methods in query efficiency, particularly under challenging preference discriminability conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning-based adaption of robotic friction models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16688v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the Fourth Industrial Revolution, wherein artificial intelligence and the automation of machines occupy a central role, the deployment of robots is indispensable. However, the manufacturing process using robots, especially in collaboration with humans, is highly intricate. In particular, modeling the friction torque in robotic joints is a longstanding problem due to the lack of a good mathematical description. This motivates the usage of data-driven methods in recent works. However, model-based and data-driven models often exhibit limitations in their ability to generalize beyond the specific dynamics they were trained on, as we demonstrate in this paper. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach based on residual learning, which aims to adapt an existing friction model to new dynamics using as little data as possible. We validate our approach by training a base neural network on a symmetric friction data set to learn an accurate relation between the velocity and the friction torque. Subsequently, to adapt to more complex asymmetric settings, we train a second network on a small dataset, focusing on predicting the residual of the initial network's output. By combining the output of both networks in a suitable manner, our proposed estimator outperforms the conventional model-based approach, an extended LuGre model, and the base neural network significantly. Furthermore, we evaluate our method on trajectories involving external loads and still observe a substantial improvement, approximately 60-70%, over the conventional approach. Our method does not rely on data with external load during training, eliminating the need for external torque sensors. This demonstrates the generalization capability of our approach, even with a small amount of data--less than a minute--enabling adaptation to diverse scenarios based on prior knowledge about friction in different settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter-Free Segmentation of Robot Movements with Cross-Correlation Using Different Similarity Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06100v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Often, robots are asked to execute primitive movements, whether as a single action or in a series of actions representing a larger, more complex task. These movements can be learned in many ways, but a common one is from demonstrations presented to the robot by a teacher. However, these demonstrations are not always simple movements themselves, and complex demonstrations must be broken down, or segmented, into primitive movements. In this work, we present a parameter-free approach to segmentation using techniques inspired by autocorrelation and cross-correlation from signal processing. In cross-correlation, a representative signal is found in some larger, more complex signal by correlating the representative signal with the larger signal. This same idea can be applied to segmenting robot motion and demonstrations, provided with a representative motion primitive. This results in a fast and accurate segmentation, which does not take any parameters. One of the main contributions of this paper is the modification of the cross-correlation process by employing similarity metrics that can capture features specific to robot movements. To validate our framework, we conduct several experiments of complex tasks both in simulation and in real-world. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our segmentation framework by comparing various similarity metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Robot Learning Using Multi-Coordinate Elastic Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06092v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To learn manipulation skills, robots need to understand the features of those skills. An easy way for robots to learn is through Learning from Demonstration (LfD), where the robot learns a skill from an expert demonstrator. While the main features of a skill might be captured in one differential coordinate (i.e., Cartesian), they could have meaning in other coordinates. For example, an important feature of a skill may be its shape or velocity profile, which are difficult to discover in Cartesian differential coordinate. In this work, we present a method which enables robots to learn skills from human demonstrations via encoding these skills into various differential coordinates, then determines the importance of each coordinate to reproduce the skill. We also introduce a modified form of Elastic Maps that includes multiple differential coordinates, combining statistical modeling of skills in these differential coordinate spaces. Elastic Maps, which are flexible and fast to compute, allow for the incorporation of several different types of constraints and the use of any number of demonstrations. Additionally, we propose methods for auto-tuning several parameters associated with the modified Elastic Map formulation. We validate our approach in several simulated experiments and a real-world writing task with a UR5e manipulator arm.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures.

| **[3D Hand-Eye Calibration for Collaborative Robot Arm: Look at Robot Base Once](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21619v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand-eye calibration is a common problem in the field of collaborative robotics, involving the determination of the transformation matrix between the visual sensor and the robot flange to enable vision-based robotic tasks. However, this process typically requires multiple movements of the robot arm and an external calibration object, making it both time-consuming and inconvenient, especially in scenarios where frequent recalibration is necessary. In this work, we extend our previous method which eliminates the need for external calibration objects such as a chessboard. We propose a generic dataset generation approach for point cloud registration, focusing on aligning the robot base point cloud with the scanned data. Furthermore, a more detailed simulation study is conducted involving several different collaborative robot arms, followed by real-world experiments in an industrial setting. Our improved method is simulated and evaluated using a total of 14 robotic arms from 9 different brands, including KUKA, Universal Robots, UFACTORY, and Franka Emika, all of which are widely used in the field of collaborative robotics. Physical experiments demonstrate that our extended approach achieves performance comparable to existing commercial hand-eye calibration solutions, while completing the entire calibration procedure in just a few seconds. In addition, we provide a user-friendly hand-eye calibration solution, with the code publicly available at github.com/leihui6/LRBO.</p></details> | updated |
| **[Adaptive Robot Localization with Ultra-wideband Novelty Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05903v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology has shown remarkable potential as a low-cost general solution for robot localization. However, limitations of the UWB signal for precise positioning arise from the disturbances caused by the environment itself, due to reflectance, multi-path effect, and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions. This problem is emphasized in cluttered indoor spaces where service robotic platforms usually operate. Both model-based and learning-based methods are currently under investigation to precisely predict the UWB error patterns. Despite the great capability in approximating strong non-linearity, learning-based methods often do not consider environmental factors and require data collection and re-training for unseen data distributions, making them not practically feasible on a large scale. The goal of this research is to develop a robust and adaptive UWB localization method for indoor confined spaces. A novelty detection technique is used to recognize outlier conditions from nominal UWB range data with a semi-supervised autoencoder. Then, the obtained novelty scores are combined with an Extended Kalman filter, leveraging a dynamic estimation of covariance and bias error for each range measurement received from the UWB anchors. The resulting solution is a compact, flexible, and robust system which enables the localization system to adapt the trustworthiness of UWB data spatially and temporally in the environment. The extensive experimentation conducted with a real robot in a wide range of testing scenarios demonstrates the advantages and benefits of the proposed solution in indoor cluttered spaces presenting NLoS conditions, reaching an average improvement of almost 60% and greater than 25cm of absolute positioning error.</p></details> |  |

The predefined gait cycle is encoded in a flexible manner, facilitating gait adjustments throughout the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KAIST HOUND, a 45 kg robotic system, can achieve biped, tripod, and quadruped locomotion using the proposed framework; quadrupedal capabilities include traversing uneven terrain, galloping at 4.67 m/s, and overcoming obstacles up to 58 cm (67 cm for HOUND2); bipedal capabilities include running at 3.6 m/s, carrying a 7.5 kg object, and ascending stairs-all performed without exteroceptive input.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, Videos at https://youtu.be/JV2_HfTlOKI, IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |

Although robotic arms are currently used primarily for functional tasks, there is considerable potential to explore ways to enhance users' body language capabilities during social interactions. This paper introduces an Augmented Body Communicator system that integrates robotic arms and a large language model. Through the incorporation of kinetic memory, disabled users and their supporters can collaboratively design actions for the robot arm. The LLM system then provides suggestions on the most suitable action based on contextual cues during interactions. The system underwent thorough user testing with six participants who have conditions affecting upper limb mobility. Results indicate that the system improves users' ability to express themselves. Based on our findings, we offer recommendations for developing robotic arms that support disabled individuals with body language capabilities and functional tasks.</p></details> |  |

How Do People Feel about Robots that Leverage Profanity?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05831v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Profanity is nearly as old as language itself, and cursing has become particularly ubiquitous within the last century. At the same time, robots in personal and service applications are often overly polite, even though past work demonstrates the potential benefits of robot norm-breaking. Thus, we became curious about robots using curse words in error scenarios as a means for improving social perceptions by human users. We investigated this idea using three phases of exploratory work: an online video-based study (N = 76) with a student pool, an online video-based study (N = 98) in the general U.S. population, and an in-person proof-of-concept deployment (N = 52) in a campus space, each of which included the following conditions: no-speech, non-expletive error response, and expletive error response. A surprising result in the outcomes for all three studies was that although verbal acknowledgment of an error was typically beneficial (as expected based on prior work), few significant differences appeared between the non-expletive and expletive error acknowledgment conditions (counter to our expectations). Within the cultural context of our work, the U.S., it seems that many users would likely not mind if robots curse, and may even find it relatable and humorous. This work signals a promising and mischievous design space that challenges typical robot character design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for the 2025 IEEE RO-MAN Conference</p></details> |

In such scenarios, alternative sensing modalities are needed to provide timely and robust feedback. To this end, we explore the use of audio and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors to detect underlying anomalies in autonomous mobile robots, such as collisions and internal mechanical faults. Furthermore, to address the challenge of limited labeled anomaly data, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection framework based on Mahalanobis Support Vector Data Description (M-SVDD). In contrast to conventional SVDD methods that rely on Euclidean distance and assume isotropic feature distributions, our approach employs the Mahalanobis distance to adaptively scale feature dimensions and capture inter-feature correlations, enabling more expressive decision boundaries. In addition, a reconstruction-based auxiliary branch is introduced to preserve feature diversity and prevent representation collapse, further enhancing the robustness of anomaly detection. Extensive experiments on a collected mobile robot dataset and four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, as shown in the video https://youtu.be/yh1tn6DDD4A.

Their kinematic redundancy enhances reachability and manipulability, enabling them to navigate complex, cluttered environments and perform a wide range of tasks. However, this redundancy also presents significant control challenges, particularly in coordinating the movements of the robot's macro-micro structure (torso and arms). Therefore, we propose various human-robot collaborative (HRC) methods for coordinating the torso and arm of remotely controlled mobile humanoid robots, aiming to balance autonomy and human input to enhance system efficiency and task execution. The proposed methods include human-initiated approaches, where users manually control torso movements, and robot-initiated approaches, which autonomously coordinate torso and arm based on factors such as reachability, task goal, or inferred human intent. We conducted a user study with N=17 participants to compare the proposed approaches in terms of task performance, manipulability, and energy efficiency, and analyzed which methods were preferred by participants.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2025).
