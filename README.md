| **[Advances in 4D Generation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14501v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative artificial intelligence has recently progressed from static image and video synthesis to 3D content generation, culminating in the emergence of 4D generation-the task of synthesizing temporally coherent dynamic 3D assets guided by user input. As a burgeoning research frontier, 4D generation enables richer interactive and immersive experiences, with applications ranging from digital humans to autonomous driving. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks a unified understanding of 4D representations, generative frameworks, basic paradigms, and the core technical challenges it faces. This survey provides a systematic and in-depth review of the 4D generation landscape. To comprehensively characterize 4D generation, we first categorize fundamental 4D representations and outline associated techniques for 4D generation. We then present an in-depth analysis of representative generative pipelines based on conditions and representation methods. Subsequently, we discuss how motion and geometry priors are integrated into 4D outputs to ensure spatio-temporal consistency under various control schemes. From an application perspective, this paper summarizes 4D generation tasks in areas such as dynamic object/scene generation, digital human synthesis, editable 4D content, and embodied AI. Furthermore, we summarize and multi-dimensionally compare four basic paradigms for 4D generation: End-to-End, Generated-Data-Based, Implicit-Distillation-Based, and Explicit-Supervision-Based. Concluding our analysis, we highlight five key challenges-consistency, controllability, diversity, efficiency, and fidelity-and contextualize these with current approaches.By distilling recent advances and outlining open problems, this work offers a comprehensive and forward-looking perspective to guide future research in 4D generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[BoxFusion: Reconstruction-Free Open-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection via Real-Time Multi-View Box Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15610v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lanlan96.github.io/BoxFusion/</p></details> |
| **[ThinkAct: Vision-Language-Action Reasoning via Reinforced Visual Latent Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16815v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jasper0314-huang.github.io/thinkact-vla/</p></details> |
| **[Towards provable probabilistic safety for scalable embodied AI systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05171v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable embodied AI systems. Instead, empirical safety evaluation is employed as an alternative, but the absence of provable guarantees imposes significant limitations. To address these issues, we argue for a paradigm shift to provable probabilistic safety that integrates provable guarantees with progressive achievement toward a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance. The new paradigm better leverages statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability, and a well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be deployed at scale. In this Perspective, we outline a roadmap for provable probabilistic safety, along with corresponding challenges and potential solutions. By bridging the gap between theoretical safety assurance and practical deployment, this Perspective offers a pathway toward safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Streaming Video Representation via Multitask Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20041v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding continuous video streams plays a fundamental role in real-time applications including embodied AI and autonomous driving. Unlike offline video understanding, streaming video understanding requires the ability to process video streams frame by frame, preserve historical information, and make low-latency decisions. To address these challenges, our main contributions are three-fold. (i) We develop a novel streaming video backbone, termed as StreamFormer, by incorporating causal temporal attention into a pre-trained vision transformer. This enables efficient streaming video processing while maintaining image representation capability. (ii) To train StreamFormer, we propose to unify diverse spatial-temporal video understanding tasks within a multitask visual-language alignment framework. Hence, StreamFormer learns global semantics, temporal dynamics, and fine-grained spatial relationships simultaneously. (iii) We conduct extensive experiments on online action detection, online video instance segmentation, and video question answering. StreamFormer achieves competitive results while maintaining efficiency, demonstrating its potential for real-time applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

| **[PR2: A Physics- and Photo-realistic Humanoid Testbed with Pilot Study in Competition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01559v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the development of a Physics-realistic and Photo-realistic humanoid robot testbed, PR2, to facilitate collaborative research between Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) and robotics. PR2 offers high-quality scene rendering and robot dynamic simulation, enabling (i) the creation of diverse scenes using various digital assets, (ii) the integration of advanced perception or foundation models, and (iii) the implementation of planning and control algorithms for dynamic humanoid robot behaviors based on environmental feedback. The beta version of PR2 has been deployed for the simulation track of a nationwide full-size humanoid robot competition for college students, attracting 137 teams and over 400 participants within four months. This competition covered traditional tasks in bipedal walking, as well as novel challenges in loco-manipulation and language-instruction-based object search, marking a first for public college robotics competitions. A retrospective analysis of the competition suggests that future events should emphasize the integration of locomotion with manipulation and perception. By making the PR2 testbed publicly available at https://github.com/pr2-humanoid/PR2-Platform, we aim to further advance education and training in humanoid robotics.

| **[EgoPrune: Efficient Token Pruning for Egomotion Video Reasoning in Embodied Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15428v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egomotion videos are first-person recordings where the view changes continuously due to the agent's movement. As they serve as the primary visual input for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient is therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, but their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video inputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person videos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints inherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a training-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning. EgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR for temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering (PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and removes redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token selector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame diversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune consistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning ratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover, we deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB edge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for on-device egomotion video reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhysX-3D: Physical-Grounded 3D Asset Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12465v3)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D modeling is moving from virtual to physical. Existing 3D generation primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models, the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we propose \textbf{PhysX-3D}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material, affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models, which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2) Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research in generative physical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://physx-3d.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[WMNav: Integrating Vision-Language Models into World Models for Object Goal Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02247v5)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object Goal Navigation-requiring an agent to locate a specific object in an unseen environment-remains a core challenge in embodied AI. Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

| **[The Duality of Generative AI and Reinforcement Learning in Robotics: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16411v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, generative AI and reinforcement learning (RL) have been redefining what is possible for AI agents that take information flows as input and produce intelligent behavior. As a result, we are seeing similar advancements in embodied AI and robotics for control policy generation. Our review paper examines the integration of generative AI models with RL to advance robotics. Our primary focus is on the duality between generative AI and RL for robotics downstream tasks. Specifically, we investigate: (1) The role of prominent generative AI tools as modular priors for multi-modal input fusion in RL tasks. (2) How RL can train, fine-tune and distill generative models for policy generation, such as VLA models, similarly to RL applications in large language models. We then propose a new taxonomy based on a considerable amount of selected papers. Lastly, we identify open challenges accounting for model scalability, adaptation and grounding, giving recommendations and insights on future research directions. We reflect on which generative AI models best fit the RL tasks and why. On the other side, we reflect on important issues inherent to RL-enhanced generative policies, such as safety concerns and failure modes, and what are the limitations of current methods. A curated collection of relevant research papers is maintained on our GitHub repository, serving as a resource for ongoing research and development in this field: https://github.com/clmoro/Robotics-RL-FMs-Integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication to Information Fusion</p></details> |
| **[STI-Bench: Are MLLMs Ready for Precise Spatial-Temporal World Understanding?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23765v6)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as an end-to-end solution for Embodied AI and Autonomous Driving has become a prevailing trend. While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[HIS-GPT: Towards 3D Human-In-Scene Multimodal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12955v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new task to benchmark human-in-scene understanding for embodied agents: Human-In-Scene Question Answering (HIS-QA). Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.

| **[A Survey: Learning Embodied Intelligence from Physical Simulators and World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00917v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) has placed embodied intelligence at the forefront of robotics research. Embodied intelligence focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the physical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only advanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract cognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest. Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the integration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their complementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in intelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and internal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment. By synthesizing current progress and identifying open challenges, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the path toward more capable and generalizable embodied AI systems. We also maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date literature and open-source projects at https://github.com/NJU3DV-LoongGroup/Embodied-World-Models-Survey.</p></details> | <details><summary>49pag...</summary><p>49pages, 25figures, 6tables, github repository avalible in https://github.com/NJU3DV-LoongGroup/Embodied-World-Models-Survey</p></details> |
| **[RoboBrain 2.0 Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02029v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce RoboBrain 2.0, our latest generation of embodied vision-language foundation models, designed to unify perception, reasoning, and planning for complex embodied tasks in physical environments. It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents. The code, checkpoint and benchmark are available at https://superrobobrain.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[View Invariant Learning for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08831v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLNCE), where an agent follows instructions and moves freely to reach a destination, is a key research problem in embodied AI. However, most navigation policies are sensitive to viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training method.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[NavComposer: Composing Language Instructions for Navigation Trajectories through Action-Scene-Object Modularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10894v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-guided navigation is a cornerstone of embodied AI, enabling agents to interpret language instructions and navigate complex environments. However, expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects, and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training. Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

Turing introduced the Imitation Game as a way to explore the question: "Can machines think?" The Total Turing Test later expanded this concept beyond purely verbal communication, incorporating perceptual and physical interaction. Building on this, we propose a new guiding question: "Can machines react?" and introduce the React to This (RTT) test for nonverbal behaviors, presenting results from an initial experiment.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively activates more neuron values in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reinforced Reasoning for Embodied Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22050v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied planning requires agents to make coherent multi-step decisions based on dynamic visual observations and natural language goals. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) excel at static perception tasks, they struggle with the temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and commonsense grounding needed for planning in interactive environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that brings R1-style reasoning enhancement into embodied planning. We first distill a high-quality dataset from a powerful closed-source model and perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with structured decision-making priors. We then design a rule-based reward function tailored to multi-step action quality and optimize the policy via Generalized Reinforced Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our approach is evaluated on Embench, a recent benchmark for interactive embodied tasks, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms models of similar or larger scale, including GPT-4o-mini and 70B+ open-source baselines, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen environments. This work highlights the potential of reinforcement-driven reasoning to advance long-horizon planning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Long-term Point Tracking in the Foundation Model Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09217v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However, real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets, offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines. However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time. Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks, demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2501.18487</p></details> |
| **[LLaPa: A Vision-Language Model Framework for Counterfactual-Aware Procedural Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08496v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models. The code and models are available https://github.com/sunshibo1234/LLaPa.</p></details> |  |
| **[SURPRISE3D: A Dataset for Spatial Understanding and Reasoning in Complex 3D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07781v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world. Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research. Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite.

| **[MapNav: A Novel Memory Representation via Annotated Semantic Maps for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13451v4)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a key task in Embodied AI, requiring agents to navigate diverse and unseen environments while following natural language instructions. Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing target person tracking (TPT) benchmarks are limited to controlled laboratory environments with few distractions, clean backgrounds, and short-term occlusions. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoramic images, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 48 sequences, both indoors and outdoors. Using this dataset and visual annotations, we perform extensive experiments with existing SOTA TPT methods, offering a thorough analysis of their limitations and suggesting future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. web: https://medlartea.github.io/tpt-bench/</p></details> |
| **[A Neural Representation Framework with LLM-Driven Spatial Reasoning for Open-Vocabulary 3D Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06719v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical feature field. This field represents language and instance features using distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations, outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their spatial reasoning capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attribution Regularization for Multimodal Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02359v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal machine learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for integrating information from multiple modalities to enhance learning and decision-making processes. However, it is commonly observed that unimodal models outperform multimodal models, despite the latter having access to richer information. Additionally, the influence of a single modality often dominates the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions. The focus of this project lies in the video-audio domain, although the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved. By leveraging this regularization term, the proposed approach aims to mitigate the issue of unimodal dominance and improve the performance of multimodal machine learning systems. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed technique will be assessed. The findings of this research project have the potential to significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal machine learning and facilitate its application in various domains, including multimedia analysis, human-computer interaction, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamArt: Generating Interactable Articulated Objects from a Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05763v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating articulated objects, such as laptops and microwaves, is a crucial yet challenging task with extensive applications in Embodied AI and AR/VR. Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture, neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated asset generation.

With PAPRLE, a user can change the arrangement of the robotic limbs, and control them using a variety of input devices, including puppeteers, gaming controllers, and VR-based interfaces. This versatility supports a wide range of teleoperation scenarios and promotes adaptability to different task requirements. To further enhance configurability, we introduce a pluggable puppeteer device that can be easily mounted and adapted to match the target robot configurations. PAPRLE supports bilateral teleoperation through these puppeteer devices, agnostic to the type or configuration of the follower robot. By supporting both joint-space and task-space control, the system provides real-time force feedback, improving user fidelity and physical interaction awareness. The modular design of PAPRLE facilitates novel spatial arrangements of the limbs and enables scalable data collection, thereby advancing research in embodied AI and learning-based control. We validate PAPRLE in various real-world settings, demonstrating its versatility across diverse combinations of leader devices and follower robots. The system will be released as open source, including both hardware and software components, to support broader adoption and community-driven extension.

However, collecting such embodied data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner, a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap. It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74% compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by 89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning.

These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices, and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings, which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents, allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-free Generation of Temporally Consistent Rewards from VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04789v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in embodied tasks such as goal decomposition and visual comprehension. However, providing accurate rewards for robotic manipulation without fine-tuning VLMs remains challenging due to the absence of domain-specific robotic knowledge in pre-trained datasets and high computational costs that hinder real-time applicability. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM, a novel training-free, temporally consistent framework that generates accurate rewards through tracking the status changes in VLM-derived subgoals. Specifically, our method first queries the VLM to establish spatially aware subgoals and an initial completion estimate before each round of interaction. We then employ a Bayesian tracking algorithm to update the goal completion status dynamically, using subgoal hidden states to generate structured rewards for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. This approach enhances long-horizon decision-making and improves failure recovery capabilities with RL. Extensive experiments indicate that $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in two robot manipulation benchmarks, demonstrating superior reward accuracy with reduced computation consumption. We believe our approach not only advances reward generation techniques but also contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://t2-vlm.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimLauncher: Launching Sample-Efficient Real-world Robotic Reinforcement Learning via Simulation Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04452v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous learning of dexterous, long-horizon robotic skills has been a longstanding pursuit of embodied AI. Recent advances in robotic reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable performance and robustness in real-world visuomotor control tasks. However, applying RL in the real world faces challenges such as low sample efficiency, slow exploration, and significant reliance on human intervention. In contrast, simulators offer a safe and efficient environment for extensive exploration and data collection, while the visual sim-to-real gap, often a limiting factor, can be mitigated using real-to-sim techniques. Building on these, we propose SimLauncher, a novel framework that combines the strengths of real-world RL and real-to-sim-to-real approaches to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we first pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment, which then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values using extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived from pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from the pre-trained policy for better exploration. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multi-stage, contact-rich, and dexterous hand manipulation tasks. Compared to prior real-world RL approaches, SimLauncher significantly improves sample efficiency and achieves near-perfect success rates. We hope this work serves as a proof of concept and inspires further research on leveraging large-scale simulation pre-training to benefit real-world robotic RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic 3D Scene Generation with Spatially Contextualized VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20129v3)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints. Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.

While single-arm systems have shown strong task performance, collaborative dual-arm systems are essential for handling more intricate tasks involving rigid, deformable, and tactile-sensitive objects. To advance this goal, we launched the RoboTwin Dual-Arm Collaboration Challenge at the 2nd MEIS Workshop, CVPR 2025.

Existing techniques generatively re-render the input video to realize the transfer, such as video relighting models and conditioned world generation models. Nevertheless, these models are predominantly limited to the domain of training data (e.g., portrait) or fall into the bottleneck of temporal consistency and computation efficiency, especially when the input video involves complex dynamics and long durations. In this paper, we propose TC-Light, a novel generative renderer to overcome these problems. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark. Extensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible re-rendering results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.

Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose estimation from reward for navigation alone. In a large study we investigate the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking, space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings, leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extend. We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.</p></details> |  |

Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets and algorithms approaching the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is underrepresented and only partly covered in the research field. In this work, we address this shortcoming by introducing: (1) Articulate3D, an expertly curated 3D dataset featuring high-quality manual annotations on 280 indoor scenes. Articulate3D provides 8 types of annotations for articulated objects, covering parts and detailed motion information, all stored in a standardized scene representation format designed for scalable 3D content creation, exchange and seamless integration into simulation environments. (2) USDNet, a novel unified framework capable of simultaneously predicting part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes for articulated objects. We evaluate USDNet on Articulate3D as well as two existing datasets, demonstrating the advantage of our unified dense prediction approach. Furthermore, we highlight the value of Articulate3D through cross-dataset and cross-domain evaluations and showcase its applicability in downstream tasks such as scene editing through LLM prompting and robotic policy training for articulated object manipulation. We provide open access to our dataset, benchmark, and method's source code.</p></details> |  |

Current language model-based navigation systems operate on discrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node connections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams into continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by DeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego dataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling to balance historical and current observations. While large language models can supervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level control. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with expert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced with a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights multi-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong performance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied navigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient, reward-driven post-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: vlnr1.github.io</p></details> |

While early efforts focused on 2D visual perception and simulation, recent 3D-aware generative world models have demonstrated the ability to synthesize geometrically consistent, interactive 3D environments, marking a shift toward 3D spatial cognition. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks systematic analysis to categorize emerging techniques and clarify their roles in advancing 3D cognitive world models. This survey addresses this need by introducing a conceptual framework, providing a structured and forward-looking review of world models transitioning from 2D perception to 3D cognition. Within this framework, we highlight two key technological drivers, particularly advances in 3D representations and the incorporation of world knowledge, as fundamental pillars. Building on these, we dissect three core cognitive capabilities that underpin 3D world modeling: 3D physical scene generation, 3D spatial reasoning, and 3D spatial interaction. We further examine the deployment of these capabilities in real-world applications, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, digital twin, and gaming/VR. Finally, we identify challenges across data, modeling, and deployment, and outline future directions for advancing more robust and generalizable 3D world models.</p></details> |  |

Recently, impressive achievements on AI-based MSFP methods have been reviewed in relevant surveys. However, we observe that the existing surveys have some limitations after a rigorous and detailed investigation. For one thing, most surveys are oriented to a single task or research field, such as 3D object detection or autonomous driving. Therefore, researchers in other related tasks often find it difficult to benefit directly. For another, most surveys only introduce MSFP from a single perspective of multi-modal fusion, while lacking consideration of the diversity of MSFP methods, such as multi-view fusion and time-series fusion. To this end, in this paper, we hope to organize MSFP research from a task-agnostic perspective, where methods are reported from various technical views. Specifically, we first introduce the background of MSFP. Next, we review multi-modal and multi-agent fusion methods. A step further, time-series fusion methods are analyzed. In the era of LLM, we also investigate multimodal LLM fusion methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions for MSFP. We hope this survey can help researchers understand the important progress in MSFP and provide possible insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

The recent rise of AI scientists and automated laboratories has accelerated both the cognitive and operational aspects of research. However, key limitations persist: AI systems are often confined to virtual environments, while automated laboratories lack the flexibility and autonomy to adaptively test new hypotheses in the physical world. Recent advances in embodied AI, such as generalist robot foundation models, diffusion-based action policies, fine-grained manipulation learning, and sim-to-real transfer, highlight the promise of integrating cognitive and embodied intelligence. This convergence opens the door to closed-loop systems that support iterative, autonomous experimentation and the possibility of serendipitous discovery. In this position paper, we propose the paradigm of Intelligent Science Laboratories (ISLs): a multi-layered, closed-loop framework that deeply integrates cognitive and embodied intelligence. ISLs unify foundation models for scientific reasoning, agent-based workflow orchestration, and embodied agents for robust physical experimentation. We argue that such systems are essential for overcoming the current limitations of scientific discovery and for realizing the full transformative potential of AI-driven science.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce InternSpatial, the largest open-source dataset for spatial reasoning in VLMs, along with InternSpatial-Bench, a corresponding evaluation benchmark designed to assess spatial understanding under diverse instruction formats. InternSpatial comprises 12 million QA pairs spanning both single-view and multi-view settings, drawn from diverse visual environments and supporting 19 instruction formats that reflect varied query styles. For evaluation, we propose InternSpatial-Bench for single-view tasks and expand multi-view reasoning by introducing a novel rotation angle prediction task that has not been explored in prior work. Experimental results show that models trained on InternSpatial achieve 12.1% improvement on InternSpatial-Bench and 10.7% on VSI-Bench, while maintaining strong performance on general-purpose benchmarks. We hope these resources will support the development of spatially capable VLMs in practical applications such as robotics and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional cloud-based telerobotics suffers from latency, reliability, scalability, and resilience issues, hindering real-time performance in critical applications. Cloud-Fog Telerobotics (CFTel) builds on the Cloud-Fog Automation (CFA) paradigm to address these limitations by leveraging a distributed Cloud-Edge-Robotics computing architecture, enabling deterministic connectivity, deterministic connected intelligence, and deterministic networked computing. This paper synthesizes recent advancements in CFTel, aiming to highlight its role in facilitating scalable, low-latency, autonomous, and AI-driven telerobotics. We analyze architectural frameworks and technologies that enable them, including 5G Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication, Edge Intelligence, Embodied AI, and Digital Twins. The study demonstrates that CFTel has the potential to enhance real-time control, scalability, and autonomy while supporting service-oriented solutions. We also discuss practical challenges, including latency constraints, cybersecurity risks, interoperability issues, and standardization efforts. This work serves as a foundational reference for researchers, stakeholders, and industry practitioners in future telerobotics research.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, accepted paper on the 23rd IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN), July 12-15, 2025, Kunming, China</p></details> |
| **[Adapting Vision-Language Models for Evaluating World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17967v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models -- generative models that simulate environment dynamics conditioned on past observations and actions -- are gaining prominence in planning, simulation, and embodied AI. However, evaluating their rollouts remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable, semantics-aware evaluator for world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Embodied AI: Advances and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05108v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied artificial intelligence (Embodied AI) plays a pivotal role in the application of advanced technologies in the intelligent era, where AI systems are integrated with physical bodies that enable them to perceive, reason, and interact with their environments. Through the use of sensors for input and actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges presented by real-world applications. To fill this gap and foster further development in the field, this paper reviews the current state of research, analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions, providing insights to guide innovation and progress in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16402v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in simulation platforms have greatly enhanced task diversity to train embodied Vision Language Models (VLMs), most platforms rely on simplified robot morphologies and bypass the stochastic nature of low-level execution, which limits their transferability to real-world robots. To address these issues, we present a physics-based simulation platform DualTHOR for complex dual-arm humanoid robots, built upon an extended version of AI2-THOR. Our simulator includes real-world robot assets, a task suite for dual-arm collaboration, and inverse kinematics solvers for humanoid robots. We also introduce a contingency mechanism that incorporates potential failures through physics-based low-level execution, bridging the gap to real-world scenarios. Our simulator enables a more comprehensive evaluation of the robustness and generalization of VLMs in household environments. Extensive evaluations reveal that current VLMs struggle with dual-arm coordination and exhibit limited robustness in realistic environments with contingencies, highlighting the importance of using our simulator to develop more capable VLMs for embodied tasks.

| **[Efficient and Generalizable Environmental Understanding for Visual Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15377v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Navigation is a core task in Embodied AI, enabling agents to navigate complex environments toward given objectives. Across diverse settings within Navigation tasks, many necessitate the modelling of sequential data accumulated from preceding time steps. While existing methods perform well, they typically process all historical observations simultaneously, overlooking the internal association structure within the data, which may limit the potential for further improvements in task performance. We address this by examining the unique characteristics of Navigation tasks through the lens of causality, introducing a causal framework to highlight the limitations of conventional sequential methods. Leveraging this insight, we propose Causality-Aware Navigation (CAN), which incorporates a Causal Understanding Module to enhance the agent's environmental understanding capability. Empirical evaluations show that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across various tasks and simulation environments. Extensive ablations studies attribute these gains to the Causal Understanding Module, which generalizes effectively in both Reinforcement and Supervised Learning settings without computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

Despite the progress made by existing methods, these methods often present some common challenges. First, they rely on pre-trained backbone models for visual perception, which struggle with the dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios. Second, the performance is limited when using pre-trained LLMs or VLMs without fine-tuning, due to the absence of VLN domain knowledge. Third, while fine-tuning LLMs and VLMs can improve results, their computational costs are higher than those without fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose Weakly-supervised Partial Contrastive Learning (WPCL), a method that enhances an agent's ability to identify objects from dynamic viewpoints in VLN scenarios by effectively integrating pre-trained VLM knowledge into the perception process, without requiring VLM fine-tuning. Our method enhances the agent's ability to interpret and respond to environmental cues while ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental results have shown that our method outperforms the baseline methods on multiple benchmarks, which validate the effectiveness, robustness and generalizability of our method.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances in robotic hardware and embodied AI have expanded their capabilities, current systems still struggle with handling thin, flat, and deformable objects such as paper and fabric. This limitation arises from the lack of suitable perception techniques for robust state estimation under diverse object appearances, as well as the absence of planning techniques for generating appropriate grasp motions. To bridge these gaps, this paper introduces PP-Tac, a robotic system for picking up paper-like objects. PP-Tac features a multi-fingered robotic hand with high-resolution omnidirectional tactile sensors \sensorname. This hardware configuration enables real-time slip detection and online frictional force control that mitigates such slips. Furthermore, grasp motion generation is achieved through a trajectory synthesis pipeline, which first constructs a dataset of finger's pinching motions. Based on this dataset, a diffusion-based policy is trained to control the hand-arm robotic system. Experiments demonstrate that PP-Tac can effectively grasp paper-like objects of varying material, thickness, and stiffness, achieving an overall success rate of 87.5\%. To our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to grasp paper-like deformable objects using a tactile dexterous hand.

| **[Semantic Mapping in Indoor Embodied AI -- A Survey on Advances, Challenges, and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05750v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent embodied agents (e.g. robots) need to perform complex semantic tasks in unfamiliar environments. Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

The diversity, realism, low cost accessibility and affordability of 3D data assets are critical for achieving generalization and scalability in embodied AI. However, most current embodied intelligence tasks still rely heavily on traditional 3D computer graphics assets manually created and annotated, which suffer from high production costs and limited realism. These limitations significantly hinder the scalability of data driven approaches. We present EmbodiedGen, a foundational platform for interactive 3D world generation. It enables the scalable generation of high-quality, controllable and photorealistic 3D assets with accurate physical properties and real-world scale in the Unified Robotics Description Format (URDF) at low cost. These assets can be directly imported into various physics simulation engines for fine-grained physical control, supporting downstream tasks in training and evaluation. EmbodiedGen is an easy-to-use, full-featured toolkit composed of six key modules: Image-to-3D, Text-to-3D, Texture Generation, Articulated Object Generation, Scene Generation and Layout Generation. EmbodiedGen generates diverse and interactive 3D worlds composed of generative 3D assets, leveraging generative AI to address the challenges of generalization and evaluation to the needs of embodied intelligence related research.

| **[Object-Centric Latent Action Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09680v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging vast amounts of unlabeled internet video data for embodied AI is currently bottlenecked by the lack of action labels and the presence of action-correlated visual distractors. Although recent latent action policy optimization (LAPO) has shown promise in inferring proxy-action labels from visual observations, its performance degrades significantly when distractors are present. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric latent action learning framework that centers on objects rather than pixels. We leverage self-supervised object-centric pretraining to disentangle action-related and distracting dynamics. This allows LAPO to focus on task-relevant interactions, resulting in more robust proxy-action labels, enabling better imitation learning and efficient adaptation of the agent with just a few action-labeled trajectories. We evaluated our method in eight visually complex tasks across the Distracting Control Suite (DCS) and Distracting MetaWorld (DMW). Our results show that object-centric pretraining mitigates the negative effects of distractors by 50%, as measured by downstream task performance: average return (DCS) and success rate (DMW).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Workshop on World Models at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025, Poster, Project Page: https://laom.dunnolab.ai/, Source code: https://github.com/dunnolab/laom</p></details> |

Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[OctoNav: Towards Generalist Embodied Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09839v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents, which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1. Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1, we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e., Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically, we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability. Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Analytic Task Scheduler: Recursive Least Squares Based Method for Continual Learning in Embodied Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09623v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied foundation models are crucial for Artificial Intelligence (AI) interacting with the physical world by integrating multi-modal inputs, such as proprioception, vision and language, to understand human intentions and generate actions to control robots. While these models demonstrate strong generalization and few-shot learning capabilities, they face significant challenges in continually acquiring new skills without forgetting previously learned skills, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose the Analytic Task Scheduler (ATS), a novel framework for continual learning in embodied foundation models. ATS consists of a task-specific model library, where each model is fine-tuned independently on a single task, and an analytic scheduler trained using recursive least squares (RLS) to learn the mapping between language instructions and task-specific models. This architecture enables accurate task recognition and dynamic model selection while fundamentally avoiding parameter interference across tasks. The scheduler updates its parameters incrementally using only statistics (autocorrelation and cross-correlation matrices), enabling forgetting-resistant learning without the need to revisit historical data. We validate ATS on a real-world robot platform (RM65B), demonstrating superior resistance to forgetting and strong adaptability to task variations. The results highlight ATS as an effective, scalable, and deployable solution for continual learning in embodied foundation models operating in complex, dynamic environments. Our code will be available at https://github.com/MIAA-Embodied-AI/AnalyticTaskScheduler</p></details> |  |

An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19789v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential for embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under distribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome these limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a systematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs compared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically investigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and execution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning, particularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic understanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable visual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs than LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for efficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for improving VLA generalization.

While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://faceong.github.io/VIKI-R/</p></details> |

Understanding their kinematic structure and reconstructing them have numerous applications in embodied AI and robotics. However, current methods require carefully captured data for training or inference, preventing practical, scalable, and generalizable reconstruction of articulated objects. We focus on reconstruction of an articulated object from a casually captured RGBD video shot with a hand-held camera. A casually captured video of an interaction with an articulated object is easy to acquire at scale using smartphones. However, this setting is quite challenging, as the object and camera move simultaneously and there are significant occlusions as the person interacts with the object. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a coarse-to-fine framework that infers joint parameters and segments movable parts of the object from a dynamic RGBD video. To evaluate our method under this new setting, we build a 20$\times$ larger synthetic dataset of 784 videos containing 284 objects across 11 categories. We compare our approach with existing methods that also take video as input. Experiments show that our method can reconstruct synthetic and real articulated objects across different categories from dynamic RGBD videos, outperforming existing methods significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website can be found at https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/video2articulation/</p></details> |

We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability, minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance embodied agent training.

Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations.

Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches such as Manifold Preserving Guided Diffusion (MPGD) apply only a single gradient update per denoising step, limiting restoration fidelity and robustness, especially in embedded or out-of-distribution settings. In this work, we introduce a multistep optimization strategy within each denoising timestep, significantly enhancing image quality, perceptual accuracy, and generalization. Our experiments on super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring demonstrate that increasing the number of gradient updates per step improves LPIPS and PSNR with minimal latency overhead. Notably, we validate this approach on a Jetson Orin Nano using degraded ImageNet and a UAV dataset, showing that MPGD, originally trained on face datasets, generalizes effectively to natural and aerial scenes. Our findings highlight MPGD's potential as a lightweight, plug-and-play restoration module for real-time visual perception in embodied AI agents such as drones and mobile robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025 Embodied AI Workshop</p></details> |
| **[DaDu-Corki: Algorithm-Architecture Co-Design for Embodied AI-powered Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04292v5)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI robots have the potential to fundamentally improve the way human beings live and manufacture. Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate, and this trend is strongly evident in manipulation tasks. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots for manipulation tasks are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes \textsc{Corki}\xspace, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI-powered robotic manipulation applications. We aim to decouple LLM inference, robotic control, and data communication in the embodied AI robots' compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, \textsc{Corki}\xspace predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. \textsc{Corki}\xspace largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to $5.1\times$, resulting in up to $5.9\times$ speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 13.9\%.</p></details> |  |

Yet, most visual relationship detection (VRD) models rely on a fixed predicate set, limiting their generalization to novel interactions. A key challenge is the inability to visually ground semantically plausible, but unannotated, relationships hypothesized from external knowledge. This work introduces an iterative visual grounding framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as structured relational priors. Inspired by expectation-maximization (EM), our method alternates between generating candidate scene graphs from detected objects using an LLM (expectation) and training a visual model to align these hypotheses with perceptual evidence (maximization). This process bootstraps relational understanding beyond annotated data and enables generalization to unseen predicates. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark for open-world VRD on Visual Genome with 21 held-out predicates and evaluate under three settings: seen, unseen, and mixed. Our model outperforms LLM-only, few-shot, and debiased baselines, achieving mean recall (mR@50) of 15.9, 13.1, and 11.7 on predicate classification on these three sets. These results highlight the promise of grounded LLM priors for scalable open-world visual understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset. Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://directlayout.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[OGGSplat: Open Gaussian Growing for Generalizable Reconstruction with Expanded Field-of-View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05204v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing semantic-aware 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging yet essential research direction, driven by the demands of emerging applications such as virtual reality and embodied AI. Existing per-scene optimization methods require dense input views and incur high computational costs, while generalizable approaches often struggle to reconstruct regions outside the input view cone. In this paper, we propose OGGSplat, an open Gaussian growing method that expands the field-of-view in generalizable 3D reconstruction. Our key insight is that the semantic attributes of open Gaussians provide strong priors for image extrapolation, enabling both semantic consistency and visual plausibility. Specifically, once open Gaussians are initialized from sparse views, we introduce an RGB-semantic consistent inpainting module applied to selected rendered views. This module enforces bidirectional control between an image diffusion model and a semantic diffusion model. The inpainted regions are then lifted back into 3D space for efficient and progressive Gaussian parameter optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a Gaussian Outpainting (GO) benchmark that assesses both semantic and generative quality of reconstructed open-vocabulary scenes. OGGSplat also demonstrates promising semantic-aware scene reconstruction capabilities when provided with two view images captured directly from a smartphone camera.</p></details> |  |

Both components employ modular 3D-printed finger designs, achieving ultra-low manufacturing costs while maintaining full actuation capabilities. Departing from conventional tendon-driven or underactuated approaches, our electromechanical system integrates independent joint motors across all 23 DoF, ensuring complete state observability and accurate kinematic modeling. This full-actuation architecture enables precise bidirectional kinematic calculations, substantially enhancing kinematic retargeting fidelity between the exoskeleton and robotic hand. The proposed system bridges the cost-performance gap in dexterous manipulation research, providing an accessible platform for acquiring high-quality demonstration data to advance embodied AI and dexterous robotic skill transfer learning.</p></details> |  |

We begin with a practical challenge: training a cross-morphology embodied AI policy that generalizes across diverse robot morphologies. We formalize this as the Heterogeneous Embodied Agent Training (HEAT) problem and prove it reduces to a structured Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that is PSPACE-complete. This result explains why current reinforcement learning pipelines break down under morphological diversity, due to sequential training constraints, memory-policy coupling, and data incompatibility. We further explore Collective Adaptation, a distributed learning alternative inspired by biological systems. Though NEXP-complete in theory, it offers meaningful scalability and deployment benefits in practice. This work illustrates how computational theory can illuminate system design trade-offs and guide the development of more robust, scalable embodied AI. For practitioners and researchers to explore this problem, the implementation code of this work has been made publicly available at https://github.com/airs-admin/HEAT</p></details> |  |

Traditional learning-based methods rely heavily on large-scale annotated data or require extensive interaction with the environment in a reinforcement learning setting, often failing to generalize to novel environments and limiting scalability. To overcome these challenges, we explore a zero-shot setting where the agent operates without task-specific training, enabling more scalable and adaptable solution. Recent advances in Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) offer powerful capabilities for visual understanding and reasoning, making them ideal for agents to comprehend scenes, identify relevant regions, and infer the likely locations of objects. In this work, we present a zero-shot object goal navigation framework that integrates the perceptual strength of VFMs with a model-based planner that is capable of long-horizon decision making through frontier exploration. We evaluate our approach on the HM3D dataset using the Habitat simulator and demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of success weighted by path length for zero-shot object goal navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 workshop - Foundation Models Meet Embodied Agents</p></details> |

Specifically, Map and Locate involves generating a point cloud from an unposed video and segmenting object instances based on open-vocabulary queries. This task serves as a critical step toward real-world embodied AI applications and introduces a practical task that bridges reconstruction, recognition and reorganization. To tackle this task, we introduce a simple yet effective baseline, which we denote as SAB3R. Our approach builds upon MASt3R, a recent breakthrough in 3D computer vision, and incorporates a lightweight distillation strategy. This method transfers dense, per-pixel semantic features from 2D vision backbones (eg, CLIP and DINOv2) to enhance MASt3R's capabilities. Without introducing any auxiliary frozen networks, our model generates per-pixel semantic features and constructs cohesive point maps in a single forward pass. Compared to separately deploying MASt3R and CLIP, our unified model, SAB3R, achieves superior performance on the Map and Locate benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate SAB3R on both 2D semantic segmentation and 3D tasks to comprehensively validate its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>3D-LL...</summary><p>3D-LLM/VLA @ CVPR2025 | Project page: https://uva-computer-vision-lab.github.io/sab3r/</p></details> |

We introduce EgoVLM, a vision-language model specifically designed to integrate visual comprehension and spatial-temporal reasoning within egocentric video contexts. EgoVLM is fine-tuned via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method adapted to align model outputs with human-like reasoning steps. Following DeepSeek R1-Zero's approach, we directly tune using RL without any supervised fine-tuning phase on chain-of-thought (CoT) data. We evaluate EgoVLM on egocentric video question answering benchmarks and show that domain-specific training substantially improves performance over general-purpose VLMs. Our EgoVLM-3B, trained exclusively on non-CoT egocentric data, outperforms the base Qwen2.5-VL 3B and 7B models by 14.33 and 13.87 accuracy points on the EgoSchema benchmark, respectively. By explicitly generating reasoning traces, EgoVLM enhances interpretability, making it well-suited for downstream applications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel keyframe-based reward that incorporates salient frame selection to guide reinforcement learning optimization. This reward formulation opens a promising avenue for future exploration in temporally grounded egocentric reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our C...</summary><p>Our Code can be found at https://github.com/adityavavre/VidEgoVLM</p></details> |

We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient Online Tuning of VLM Agents via Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03792v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online fine-tuning vision-language model (VLM) agents with reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise for equipping agents with multi-step, goal-oriented capabilities in dynamic environments. However, their open-ended textual action space and non-end-to-end nature of action generation present significant challenges to effective online exploration in RL, e.g., explosion of the exploration space. We propose a novel online fine-tuning method, Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning (CoSo), better suited to the textual output space of VLM agents. Compared to prior methods that assign uniform uncertainty to all tokens, CoSo leverages counterfactual reasoning to dynamically assess the causal influence of individual tokens on post-processed actions. By prioritizing the exploration of action-critical tokens while reducing the impact of semantically redundant or low-impact tokens, CoSo enables a more targeted and efficient online rollout process. We provide theoretical analysis proving CoSo's convergence and policy improvement guarantees, and extensive empirical evaluations supporting CoSo's effectiveness. Our results across a diverse set of agent tasks, including Android device control, card gaming, and embodied AI, highlight its remarkable ability to enhance exploration efficiency and deliver consistent performance gains.

Recent learned approaches such as DUSt3R have shown impressive performance in multiview settings. However, these models treat images as unstructured collections, limiting effectiveness in scenarios where frames are captured from synchronized rigs with known or inferable structure. To this end, we introduce Rig3R, a generalization of prior multiview reconstruction models that incorporates rig structure when available, and learns to infer it when not. Rig3R conditions on optional rig metadata including camera ID, time, and rig poses to develop a rig-aware latent space that remains robust to missing information. It jointly predicts pointmaps and two types of raymaps: a pose raymap relative to a global frame, and a rig raymap relative to a rig-centric frame consistent across time. Rig raymaps allow the model to infer rig structure directly from input images when metadata is missing. Rig3R achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction, camera pose estimation, and rig discovery, outperforming both traditional and learned methods by 17-45% mAA across diverse real-world rig datasets, all in a single forward pass without post-processing or iterative refinement.</p></details> |  |

While existing audio spatialization methods can generally map any available monaural audio to binaural audio signals, they often lack the flexible and interactive control needed in complex multi-object user-interactive environments. To address this, we propose a Text-guided Audio Spatialization (TAS) framework that utilizes flexible text prompts and evaluates our model from unified generation and comprehension perspectives. Due to the limited availability of premium and large-scale stereo data, we construct the SpatialTAS dataset, which encompasses 376,000 simulated binaural audio samples to facilitate the training of our model. Our model learns binaural differences guided by 3D spatial location and relative position prompts, augmented by flipped-channel audio. It outperforms existing methods on both simulated and real-recorded datasets, demonstrating superior generalization and accuracy. Besides, we develop an assessment model based on Llama-3.1-8B, which evaluates the spatial semantic coherence between our generated binaural audio and text prompts through a spatial reasoning task. Results demonstrate that text prompts provide flexible and interactive control to generate binaural audio with excellent quality and semantic consistency in spatial locations.

Recently, autoregressive models have emerged as a significant area of focus in computer vision, where they excel in producing high-quality visual content. Autoregressive models in NLP typically operate on subword tokens. However, the representation strategy in computer vision can vary in different levels, i.e., pixel-level, token-level, or scale-level, reflecting the diverse and hierarchical nature of visual data compared to the sequential structure of language. This survey comprehensively examines the literature on autoregressive models applied to vision. To improve readability for researchers from diverse research backgrounds, we start with preliminary sequence representation and modeling in vision. Next, we divide the fundamental frameworks of visual autoregressive models into three general sub-categories, including pixel-based, token-based, and scale-based models based on the representation strategy. We then explore the interconnections between autoregressive models and other generative models. Furthermore, we present a multifaceted categorization of autoregressive models in computer vision, including image generation, video generation, 3D generation, and multimodal generation. We also elaborate on their applications in diverse domains, including emerging domains such as embodied AI and 3D medical AI, with about 250 related references. Finally, we highlight the current challenges to autoregressive models in vision with suggestions about potential research directions.

We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization. Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment. Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy. For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex, providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive biases in this system. For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of recurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with tailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile perception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

While more robotics datasets are being created, the landscape of open data in the field is uneven. This is due to a lack of curation standards and consistent publication practices, which makes it difficult to discover, access, and reuse robotics data. To address these challenges, this paper presents a curation and access system with two main contributions: (1) a structured methodology to curate, publish, and integrate FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) human-centered robotics datasets; and (2) a ChatGPT-powered conversational interface trained with the curated datasets metadata and documentation to enable exploration, comparison robotics datasets and data retrieval using natural language. Developed based on practical experience curating datasets from robotics labs within Texas Robotics at the University of Texas at Austin, the system demonstrates the value of standardized curation and persistent publication of robotics data. The system's evaluation suggests that access and understandability of human-robotics data are significantly improved.

Egocentric Spatial Reasoning in VLMs Across Disjoint Frames](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24257v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An embodied AI assistant operating on egocentric video must integrate spatial cues across time - for instance, determining where an object A, glimpsed a few moments ago lies relative to an object B encountered later. We introduce Disjoint-3DQA , a generative QA benchmark that evaluates this ability of VLMs by posing questions about object pairs that are not co-visible in the same frame. We evaluated seven state-of-the-art VLMs and found that models lag behind human performance by 28%, with steeper declines in accuracy (60% to 30 %) as the temporal gap widens. Our analysis further reveals that providing trajectories or bird's-eye-view projections to VLMs results in only marginal improvements, whereas providing oracle 3D coordinates leads to a substantial 20% performance increase. This highlights a core bottleneck of multi-frame VLMs in constructing and maintaining 3D scene representations over time from visual signals. Disjoint-3DQA therefore sets a clear, measurable challenge for long-horizon spatial reasoning and aims to catalyze future research at the intersection of vision, language, and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

ManiSkill3 supports GPU parallelization of many aspects including simulation+rendering, heterogeneous simulation, pointclouds/voxels visual input, and more. Simulation with rendering on ManiSkill3 can run 10-1000x faster with 2-3x less GPU memory usage than other platforms, achieving up to 30,000+ FPS in benchmarked environments due to minimal python/pytorch overhead in the system, simulation on the GPU, and the use of the SAPIEN parallel rendering system. Tasks that used to take hours to train can now take minutes. We further provide the most comprehensive range of GPU parallelized environments/tasks spanning 12 distinct domains including but not limited to mobile manipulation for tasks such as drawing, humanoids, and dextrous manipulation in realistic scenes designed by artists or real-world digital twins. In addition, millions of demonstration frames are provided from motion planning, RL, and teleoperation.

Modeling hand-object interaction priors holds significant potential to advance robotic and embodied AI systems in learning to operate effectively within the physical world. We introduce SIGHT, a novel task focused on generating realistic and physically plausible 3D hand-object interaction trajectories from a single image and a brief language-based task description. Prior work on hand-object trajectory generation typically relies on textual input that lacks explicit grounding to the target object, or assumes access to 3D object meshes, which are often considerably more difficult to obtain than 2D images. We propose SIGHT-Fusion, a novel diffusion-based image-text conditioned generative model that tackles this task by retrieving the most similar 3D object mesh from a database and enforcing geometric hand-object interaction constraints via a novel inference-time diffusion guidance. We benchmark our model on the HOI4D and H2O datasets, adapting relevant baselines for this novel task. Experiments demonstrate our superior performance in the diversity and quality of generated trajectories, as well as in hand-object interaction geometry metrics.</p></details> |  |

This task is inherently challenging as it requires both accurate target recognition and effective trajectory planning under conditions of severe occlusion and high scene dynamics. Existing approaches typically address this challenge through a modular separation of recognition and planning. In this work, we propose TrackVLA, a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that learns the synergy between object recognition and trajectory planning. Leveraging a shared LLM backbone, we employ a language modeling head for recognition and an anchor-based diffusion model for trajectory planning. To train TrackVLA, we construct an Embodied Visual Tracking Benchmark (EVT-Bench) and collect diverse difficulty levels of recognition samples, resulting in a dataset of 1.7 million samples. Through extensive experiments in both synthetic and real-world environments, TrackVLA demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalizability. It significantly outperforms existing methods on public benchmarks in a zero-shot manner while remaining robust to high dynamics and occlusion in real-world scenarios at 10 FPS inference speed.

A Benchmark and Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19510v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for their expanding applications in embodied AI, robotics, and other real-world tasks. To effectively support these applications, grounding in spatial and temporal understanding in multimodal environments is essential. To this end, recent works have leveraged scene graphs, a structured representation that encodes entities, attributes, and their relationships in a scene. However, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' ability to utilize scene graphs remains limited. In this work, we introduce Text-Scene Graph (TSG) Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs' ability to (1) understand scene graphs and (2) generate them from textual narratives. With TSG Bench we evaluate 11 LLMs and reveal that, while models perform well on scene graph understanding, they struggle with scene graph generation, particularly for complex narratives. Our analysis indicates that these models fail to effectively decompose discrete scenes from a complex narrative, leading to a bottleneck when generating scene graphs. These findings underscore the need for improved methodologies in scene graph generation and provide valuable insights for future research.

Second, we develop ViCA-7B, fine-tuned on ViCA-322K, which achieves new state-of-the-art on all eight VSI-Bench tasks, outperforming existing models, including larger ones (e.g., +26.1 on Absolute Distance). For interpretability, we present ViCA-Thinking-2.68K, a dataset with explicit reasoning chains, and fine-tune ViCA-7B to create ViCA-7B-Thinking, a model that articulates its spatial reasoning. Our work highlights the importance of targeted data and suggests paths for improved temporal-spatial modeling. We release all resources to foster research in robust visuospatial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author list corrected.

| **[Functionality understanding and segmentation in 3D scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16310v5)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding functionalities in 3D scenes involves interpreting natural language descriptions to locate functional interactive objects, such as handles and buttons, in a 3D environment. Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light', an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description. To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a vision and language model. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D segmentation approaches.

We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://zju-real.github.io/ViewSpatial-Page/</p></details> |

By combining foundation models with the principles of embodied AI, where intelligent systems perceive, reason, and act through physical interactions, robots can improve understanding, adapt to, and execute complex tasks in dynamic real-world environments. However, embodied AI in mobile service robots continues to face key challenges, including multimodal sensor fusion, real-time decision-making under uncertainty, task generalization, and effective human-robot interactions (HRI). In this paper, we present the first systematic review of the integration of foundation models in mobile service robotics, identifying key open challenges in embodied AI and examining how foundation models can address them. Namely, we explore the role of such models in enabling real-time sensor fusion, language-conditioned control, and adaptive task execution. Furthermore, we discuss real-world applications in the domestic assistance, healthcare, and service automation sectors, demonstrating the transformative impact of foundation models on service robotics. We also include potential future research directions, emphasizing the need for predictive scaling laws, autonomous long-term adaptation, and cross-embodiment generalization to enable scalable, efficient, and robust deployment of foundation models in human-centric robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring 3D Activity Reasoning and Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D activity reasoning and planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advance in multimodal learning. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D activity reasoning and planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v3)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |

Identity-Preserving Multi-Person Interactive Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18078v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable video generation (CVG) has advanced rapidly, yet current systems falter when more than one actor must move, interact, and exchange positions under noisy control signals. We address this gap with DanceTogether, the first end-to-end diffusion framework that turns a single reference image plus independent pose-mask streams into long, photorealistic videos while strictly preserving every identity. A novel MaskPoseAdapter binds "who" and "how" at every denoising step by fusing robust tracking masks with semantically rich-but noisy-pose heat-maps, eliminating the identity drift and appearance bleeding that plague frame-wise pipelines. To train and evaluate at scale, we introduce (i) PairFS-4K, 26 hours of dual-skater footage with 7,000+ distinct IDs, (ii) HumanRob-300, a one-hour humanoid-robot interaction set for rapid cross-domain transfer, and (iii) TogetherVideoBench, a three-track benchmark centered on the DanceTogEval-100 test suite covering dance, boxing, wrestling, yoga, and figure skating. On TogetherVideoBench, DanceTogether outperforms the prior arts by a significant margin. Moreover, we show that a one-hour fine-tune yields convincing human-robot videos, underscoring broad generalization to embodied-AI and HRI tasks. Extensive ablations confirm that persistent identity-action binding is critical to these gains. Together, our model, datasets, and benchmark lift CVG from single-subject choreography to compositionally controllable, multi-actor interaction, opening new avenues for digital production, simulation, and embodied intelligence.

To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions. Our work provides a foundation for the next generation of embodied AI systems capable of robust, long-term reasoning and planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perceptual Quality Assessment for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16815v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI has developed rapidly in recent years, but it is still mainly deployed in laboratories, with various distortions in the Real-world limiting its application. Traditionally, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods are applied to predict human preferences for distorted images; however, there is no IQA method to assess the usability of an image in embodied tasks, namely, the perceptual quality for robots. To provide accurate and reliable quality indicators for future embodied scenarios, we first propose the topic: IQA for Embodied AI. Specifically, we (1) based on the Mertonian system and meta-cognitive theory, constructed a perception-cognition-decision-execution pipeline and defined a comprehensive subjective score collection process; (2) established the Embodied-IQA database, containing over 36k reference/distorted image pairs, with more than 5m fine-grained annotations provided by Vision Language Models/Vision Language Action-models/Real-world robots; (3) trained and validated the performance of mainstream IQA methods on Embodied-IQA, demonstrating the need to develop more accurate quality indicators for Embodied AI. We sincerely hope that through evaluation, we can promote the application of Embodied AI under complex distortions in the Real-world.

| **[Praxis-VLM: Vision-Grounded Decision Making via Text-Driven Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16965v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models exhibited immense potential for embodied AI, yet they often lack the sophisticated situational reasoning required for complex decision-making. This paper shows that VLMs can achieve surprisingly strong decision-making performance when visual scenes are represented merely as text-only descriptions, suggesting foundational reasoning can be effectively learned from language. Motivated by this insight, we propose Praxis-VLM, a reasoning VLM for vision-grounded decision-making. Praxis-VLM employs the GRPO algorithm on textual scenarios to instill robust reasoning capabilities, where models learn to evaluate actions and their consequences. These reasoning skills, acquired purely from text, successfully transfer to multimodal inference with visual inputs, significantly reducing reliance on scarce paired image-text training data. Experiments across diverse decision-making benchmarks demonstrate that Praxis-VLM substantially outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning, exhibiting superior performance and generalizability. Further analysis confirms that our models engage in explicit and effective reasoning, underpinning their enhanced performance and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

Recent success of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates that specialization of parameters enables strong scalability. In this work, we propose DriveMoE, a novel MoE-based E2E-AD framework, with a Scene-Specialized Vision MoE and a Skill-Specialized Action MoE. DriveMoE is built upon our $\pi_0$ Vision-Language-Action (VLA) baseline (originally from the embodied AI field), called Drive-$\pi_0$. Specifically, we add Vision MoE to Drive-$\pi_0$ by training a router to select relevant cameras according to the driving context dynamically. This design mirrors human driving cognition, where drivers selectively attend to crucial visual cues rather than exhaustively processing all visual information. In addition, we add Action MoE by training another router to activate specialized expert modules for different driving behaviors. Through explicit behavioral specialization, DriveMoE is able to handle diverse scenarios without suffering from modes averaging like existing models. In Bench2Drive closed-loop evaluation experiments, DriveMoE achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining vision and action MoE in autonomous driving tasks. We will release our code and models of DriveMoE and Drive-$\pi_0$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://thinklab-sjtu.github.io/DriveMoE/</p></details> |

| **[Checklists Are Better Than Reward Models For Aligning Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18624v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions. Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF). From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs - then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a 3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that express a multitude of needs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for near-optimal planning in POMDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18606v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for decision-making in partially observable environments, which can be modeled as Markov decision processes and compactly represented through dynamic decision Bayesian networks. Recent advances demonstrate that inference on sparse Bayesian networks can be accelerated using quantum rejection sampling combined with amplitude amplification, leading to a computational speedup in estimating acceptance probabilities.\\ Building on this result, we introduce Quantum Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (QBRL), a hybrid quantum-classical look-ahead algorithm for model-based RL in partially observable environments. We present a rigorous, oracle-free time complexity analysis under fault-tolerant assumptions for the quantum device. Unlike standard treatments that assume a black-box oracle, we explicitly specify the inference process, allowing our bounds to more accurately reflect the true computational cost. We show that, for environments whose dynamics form a sparse Bayesian network, horizon-based near-optimal planning can be achieved sub-quadratically faster through quantum-enhanced belief updates. Furthermore, we present numerical experiments benchmarking QBRL against its classical counterpart on simple yet illustrative decision-making tasks. Our results offer a detailed analysis of how the quantum computational advantage translates into decision-making performance, highlighting that the magnitude of the advantage can vary significantly across different deployment settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling RL to Long Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07966v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 104K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In our experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on video benchmarks, reaching 65.0% and 70.7% accuracy on VideoMME without and with subtitles, respectively, and consistently outperforming LongVILA-R1 across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, LongVILA-R1 shows steady performance improvements as the number of input video frames increases. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k tokens).</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code at https://github.com/NVlabs/Long-RL and model at https://huggingface.co/Efficient-Large-Model/LongVILA-R1-7B</p></details> |

It is developed by our proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive, safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety `aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of $46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism, enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 18 figures, authors are listed in alphabetical order by their last names</p></details> |

Our three-tier architecture employs base RL agents to process hybrid data, meta-agents to aggregate their decisions, and a super-agent to merge decisions based on market data and sentiment analysis. Evaluated on data from 2018 to 2024, after training on 2000-2017, the framework achieves a 26% annualized return and a Sharpe ratio of 1.2, outperforming equal-weighted and S&P 500 benchmarks.

However, post-training methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) often struggle with generalization, favoring memorization over transferable learning. In this work, we introduce Omni-Thinker, a unified reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enhances LLM performance across diverse tasks by combining rule-based verifiable rewards with generative preference signals via LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Our approach enables consistent optimization across task types and scales RL-based training to subjective domains. We further investigate training strategies, demonstrating that a curriculum-based progression that orders tasks from structured to open-ended improves performance and reduces forgetting. Experimental results across four domains reveal that curriculum learning improves performance by 5.2% over joint training and 9.1% over model merging. These results highlight the importance of task-aware sampling and hybrid supervision in scaling RL-based post-training for general-purpose LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Bisimulation Metric for Robust Representations in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18519v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks. However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an RL algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one, and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N^{\frac{3}{4}})$ up to a logarithmic factor, where $N$ is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. We also perform numerical comparisons between our method and those of the recent model-based stochastic LQ RL studies adapted to the state- and control-dependent volatility setting, demonstrating a better performance of the former in terms of regret bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO for Small-Scale Model Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19780v5)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong generalization across a wide range of language tasks, but often generate outputs that misalign with human preferences. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) addresses this by optimizing models toward human preferences using a learned reward function and reinforcement learning, yielding improved alignment but suffering from high computational cost and instability. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplifies the process by treating alignment as a classification task over binary preference pairs, reducing training overhead while achieving competitive performance. However, it assumes fixed, single-dimensional preferences and only supports pairwise supervision. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-Preference Lambda-weighted Listwise DPO, which allows the model to learn from more detailed human feedback and flexibly balance multiple goals such as helpfulness, honesty, and fluency. Our method models full-ranked preference distributions rather than binary comparisons, enabling more informative learning signals. The lambda vector controls the relative importance of different alignment goals, allowing the model to generalize across diverse human objectives. During inference, lambda can be adjusted without retraining, providing controllable alignment behavior for downstream use. We also introduce a learned scheduler that dynamically samples performant lambda configurations to improve robustness. Notably, our method requires only 20GB of GPU memory for training, making it suitable for compute-constrained settings such as academic labs, educational tools, or on-device assistants. Experiments on 1B-2B scale models show that our method consistently outperforms standard DPO on alignment benchmarks while enabling efficient, controllable, and fine-grained adaptation suitable for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 12 figures, appendix included.

In particular, we guide the imitation learning procedures by transferring motions from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities while ensuring the physical feasibility of the target system. In the first stage, we focus on motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. Following this, we refine the motion at the dynamic level by adjusting it in the temporal domain while adhering to physical constraints. This process facilitates policy training via reinforcement learning, enabling precise and robust motion tracking. We demonstrate that our approach successfully transforms noisy motion sources, such as hand-held camera videos, into robot-specific motions that align with the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. Moreover, we demonstrate terrain-aware motion retargeting to perform BackFlip on top of a box. We successfully deployed these skills to four robots with different dimensions and physical properties in the real world through hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 12 figures, videos available at https://taerimyoon.me/Spatio-Temporal-Motion-Retargeting-for-Quadruped-Robots/</p></details> |
| **[Towards Designing an Energy Aware Data Replication Strategy for Cloud Systems Using Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18459v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of global data volumes has created a demand for scalable distributed systems that can maintain a high quality of service. Data replication is a widely used technique that provides fault tolerance, improved performance and higher availability. Traditional implementations often rely on threshold-based activation mechanisms, which can vary depending on workload changes and system architecture. System administrators typically bear the responsibility of adjusting these thresholds. To address this challenge, reinforcement learning can be used to dynamically adapt to workload changes and different architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel data replication strategy for cloud systems that employs reinforcement learning to automatically learn system characteristics and adapt to workload changes. The strategy's aim is to provide satisfactory Quality of Service while optimizing a trade-off between provider profit and environmental impact. We present the architecture behind our solution and describe the reinforcement learning model by defining the states, actions and rewards.</p></details> |  |
| **[Outcome-Based Online Reinforcement Learning: Algorithms and Fundamental Limits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20268v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with outcome-based feedback faces a fundamental challenge: when rewards are only observed at trajectory endpoints, how do we assign credit to the right actions? This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of this problem in online RL with general function approximation. We develop a provably sample-efficient algorithm achieving $\widetilde{O}({C_{\rm cov} H^3}/{\epsilon^2})$ sample complexity, where $C_{\rm cov}$ is the coverability coefficient of the underlying MDP. By leveraging general function approximation, our approach works effectively in large or infinite state spaces where tabular methods fail, requiring only that value functions and reward functions can be represented by appropriate function classes. Our results also characterize when outcome-based feedback is statistically separated from per-step rewards, revealing an unavoidable exponential separation for certain MDPs. For deterministic MDPs, we show how to eliminate the completeness assumption, dramatically simplifying the algorithm. We further extend our approach to preference-based feedback settings, proving that equivalent statistical efficiency can be achieved even under more limited information. Together, these results constitute a theoretical foundation for understanding the statistical properties of outcome-based reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

While various efforts have been made to leverage natural language for content generation, research on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents utilizing text-based instructions for procedural content generation remains limited. In this paper, we propose IPCGRL, an instruction-based procedural content generation method via reinforcement learning, which incorporates a sentence embedding model. IPCGRL fine-tunes task-specific embedding representations to effectively compress game-level conditions. We evaluate IPCGRL in a two-dimensional level generation task and compare its performance with a general-purpose embedding method. The results indicate that IPCGRL achieves up to a 21.4% improvement in controllability and a 17.2% improvement in generalizability for unseen instructions. Furthermore, the proposed method extends the modality of conditional input, enabling a more flexible and expressive interaction framework for procedural content generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables, accepted to Conference on Games 2025</p></details> |

However, current multimodal models for gastrointestinal pathology are constrained by both data quality and reasoning transparency: pervasive noise and incomplete annotations in public datasets predispose vision language models to factual hallucinations when generating diagnostic text, while the absence of explicit intermediate reasoning chains renders the outputs difficult to audit and thus less trustworthy in clinical practice. To address these issues, we construct a large scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset containing both microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, and propose a prompt argumentation strategy that incorporates lesion classification and anatomical site information. This design guides the model to better capture image specific features and maintain semantic consistency in generation. Furthermore, we employ a post training pipeline that combines supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning quality and output structure. Experimental results on real world pathology report generation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state of the art open source and proprietary baselines in terms of generation quality, structural completeness, and clinical relevance. Our solution outperforms state of the art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4% improved structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors, demonstrating superior accuracy and clinical utility compared to existing solutions.</p></details> |  |

Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time, despite requiring longer training time.</p></details> | 10 pages |

| **[Revisiting LLM Reasoning via Information Bottleneck](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18391v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However, existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO), a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent improvements in LLM reasoning performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beamforming and Resource Allocation for Delay Minimization in RIS-Assisted OFDM Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03586v4)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates a joint beamforming and resource allocation problem in downlink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems to minimize the average delay, where data packets for each user arrive at the base station (BS) stochastically. The sequential optimization problem is inherently a Markov decision process (MDP), thus falling within the remit of reinforcement learning. To effectively handle the mixed action space and reduce the state space dimensionality, a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed. Specifically, proximal policy optimization (PPO)-Theta is employed to optimize the RIS phase shift design, while PPO-N is responsible for subcarrier allocation decisions. The active beamforming at the BS is then derived from the jointly optimized RIS phase shifts and subcarrier allocation decisions. To further mitigate the curse of dimensionality associated with subcarrier allocation, a multi-agent strategy is introduced to optimize the subcarrier allocation indicators more efficiently. Moreover, to achieve more adaptive resource allocation and accurately capture the network dynamics, key factors closely related to average delay, such as the number of backlogged packets in buffers and current packet arrivals, are incorporated into the state space. Furthermore, a transfer learning framework is introduced to enhance the training efficiency and accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the average delay, enhances resource allocation efficiency, and achieves superior system robustness and fairness compared to baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Remembering the Markov Property in Cooperative MARL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18333v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is typically formalised as a Decentralised Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP), where agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour. In practice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function approximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial information. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of these methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory. Through a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents. Crucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design necessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of the learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also suggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core assumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative environments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in observations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring success requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.</p></details> | <details><summary>RLC F...</summary><p>RLC Finding the Frame Workshop Camera-Ready, 8 pages</p></details> |

While individual success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment, multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments, and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy learning process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Workshop on Computational Optimization of Buildings (ICML CO-BUILD), 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025), Vancouver, Canada</p></details> |
| **[From Individual Learning to Market Equilibrium: Correcting Structural and Parametric Biases in RL Simulations of Economic Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18229v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to economic modeling reveals a fundamental conflict between the assumptions of equilibrium theory and the emergent behavior of learning agents. While canonical economic models assume atomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive single-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of its environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a search-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL agent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify a parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and RL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a calibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a representative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost function to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm converges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with the competitive equilibrium. This approach provides a tractable and theoretically sound methodology for modeling learning agents in economic systems within the broader domain of computational social science.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Temporal Abstractions via Variational Homomorphisms in Option-Induced Abstract MDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16473v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning ability through explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but generating these step-by-step textual explanations is computationally expensive and slow. To overcome this, we aim to develop a framework for efficient, implicit reasoning, where the model "thinks" in a latent space without generating explicit text for every step. We propose that these latent thoughts can be modeled as temporally-extended abstract actions, or options, within a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework. To effectively learn a diverse library of options as latent embeddings, we first introduce the Variational Markovian Option Critic (VMOC), an off-policy algorithm that uses variational inference within the HiT-MDP framework. To provide a rigorous foundation for using these options as an abstract reasoning space, we extend the theory of continuous MDP homomorphisms. This proves that learning a policy in the simplified, abstract latent space, for which VMOC is suited, preserves the optimality of the solution to the original, complex problem. Finally, we propose a cold-start procedure that leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to distill human reasoning demonstrations into this latent option space, providing a rich initialization for the model's reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on complex logical reasoning benchmarks and challenging locomotion tasks, validating our framework as a principled method for learning abstract skills for both language and control.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a differentiated reward method based on steady-state transition systems, which incorporates state transition gradient information into the reward design by analyzing traffic flow characteristics, aiming to optimize action selection and policy learning in multi-vehicle cooperative decision-making. The performance of the proposed method is validated in RL algorithms such as MAPPO, MADQN, and QMIX under varying autonomous vehicle penetration. The results show that the differentiated reward method significantly accelerates training convergence and outperforms centering reward and others in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, and action rationality. Additionally, the method demonstrates strong scalability and environmental adaptability, providing a novel approach for multi-agent cooperative decision-making in complex traffic scenarios.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Various causal inference and reinforcement learning methods developed in the literature are applicable to A/B testing. This paper introduces a two-armed bandit framework designed to improve the power of existing approaches. The proposed procedure consists of three main steps: (i) employing doubly robust estimation to generate pseudo-outcomes, (ii) utilizing a two-armed bandit framework to construct the test statistic, and (iii) applying a permutation-based method to compute the $p$-value. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through asymptotic theories, numerical experiments and real-world data from a ridesharing company, showing its superior performance in comparison to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Policy Disruption in Reinforcement Learning:Adversarial Attack with Large Language Models and Critical State Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18113v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Our focus centers on a network that includes multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) competing for physical resource blocks (PRBs) with the goal of meeting probabilistic delay upper bound constraints for their clients while minimizing PRB utilization. Initially, we derive a reward function based on the law of large numbers (LLN), then implement practical modifications to adapt it for real-world experimental scenarios. We then propose our solution, the Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL), which demonstrates its superiority over several baselines, including DRL models optimized for average delay constraints, by achieving a 38\% reduction in resultant average delay. Furthermore, we delve into the issue of model weight sharing among multiple MVNOs to develop a robust personalized model. We introduce a reward-based personalization method where each agent prioritizes other agents' model weights based on their performance. This technique surpasses traditional aggregation methods, such as federated averaging, and strategies reliant on traffic patterns and model weight distance similarities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-Stage TSO-DSO Services Provision Framework for Electric Vehicle Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18110v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High renewable penetration has been witnessed in power systems, resulting in reduced system inertia and increasing requirements for frequency response services. Electric vehicles (EVs), owing to their vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities, can provide cost-effective frequency services for transmission system operators (TSOs). However, EVs that are inherently connected to distribution networks may pose voltage security issues for distribution system operators (DSOs) when supporting TSO frequency. To coordinate both TSO frequency and DSO voltage, this paper proposes a two-stage service provision framework for multi-EVs. At stage one, EVs participate in day-ahead TSO-DSO interactions for frequency reserve schedules; at stage two, EVs make real-time dispatching behaviors in distribution networks for reserve delivery while supporting DSO voltage. Considering the potentially large EV number and environment complexity, a decentralized operation paradigm is introduced for real-time EV dispatches at stage two, while a communication-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to reduce the communication overhead during large-scale multi-agent RL training without compromising policy performance. Case studies are carried out on a 6-bus transmission and 33-bus distribution network as well as a 69-bus distribution network to evaluate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method in enabling EVs for frequency service and voltage support.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing MLLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) architectures, which impose inherent limitations on future development, such as the raster-scan order in image generation and restricted reasoning abilities in causal context modeling. In this work, we challenge the dominance of AR-based approaches by introducing FUDOKI, a unified multimodal model purely based on discrete flow matching, as an alternative to conventional AR paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths with kinetic optimal velocities, our framework goes beyond the previous masking-based corruption process, enabling iterative refinement with self-correction capability and richer bidirectional context integration during generation. To mitigate the high cost of training from scratch, we initialize FUDOKI from pre-trained AR-based MLLMs and adaptively transition to the discrete flow matching paradigm. Experimental results show that FUDOKI achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR-based MLLMs across both visual understanding and image generation tasks, highlighting its potential as a foundation for next-generation unified multimodal models. Furthermore, we show that applying test-time scaling techniques to FUDOKI yields significant performance gains, further underscoring its promise for future enhancement through reinforcement learning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 12 figures |

| **[Towards Microgrid Resilience Enhancement via Mobile Power Sources and Repair Crews: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18095v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile power sources (MPSs) have been gradually deployed in microgrids as critical resources to coordinate with repair crews (RCs) towards resilience enhancement owing to their flexibility and mobility in handling the complex coupled power-transport systems. However, previous work solves the coordinated dispatch problem of MPSs and RCs in a centralized manner with the assumption that the communication network is still fully functioning after the event. However, there is growing evidence that certain extreme events will damage or degrade communication infrastructure, which makes centralized decision making impractical. To fill this gap, this paper formulates the resilience-driven dispatch problem of MPSs and RCs in a decentralized framework. To solve this problem, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning method featuring a two-level framework is proposed, where the high-level action is used to switch decision-making between power and transport networks, and the low-level action constructed via a hybrid policy is used to compute continuous scheduling and discrete routing decisions in power and transport networks, respectively. The proposed method also uses an embedded function encapsulating system dynamics to enhance learning stability and scalability. Case studies based on IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus power networks are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in load restoration.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we constructed a dynamic Probabilistic Boolean Network model using transcriptomic data from patient tumor biopsies to elucidate the regulatory logic governing therapy response. We then employed a reinforcement learning agent to systematically discover optimal, multi-step therapeutic interventions and used explainable artificial intelligence to mechanistically interpret the agent's control policy. The analysis revealed that a precisely timed, 4-step temporary inhibition of the lysyl oxidase like 2 protein (LOXL2) was the most effective strategy. Our explainable analysis showed that this ''hit-and-run" intervention is sufficient to erase the molecular signature driving resistance, allowing the network to self-correct without requiring sustained intervention. This study presents a novel, time-dependent therapeutic hypothesis for overcoming immunotherapy resistance and provides a powerful computational framework for identifying non-obvious intervention protocols in complex biological systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures.

However, compared to the rapid developments in the AI community, recommendation systems have not achieved a breakthrough in recent years. For instance, they still rely on a multi-stage cascaded architecture rather than an end-to-end approach, leading to computational fragmentation and optimization inconsistencies, and hindering the effective application of key breakthrough technologies from the AI community in recommendation scenarios. To address these issues, we propose OneRec, which reshapes the recommendation system through an end-to-end generative approach and achieves promising results. Firstly, we have enhanced the computational FLOPs of the current recommendation model by 10 $\times$ and have identified the scaling laws for recommendations within certain boundaries. Secondly, reinforcement learning techniques, previously difficult to apply for optimizing recommendations, show significant potential in this framework. Lastly, through infrastructure optimizations, we have achieved 23.7% and 28.8% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) on flagship GPUs during training and inference, respectively, aligning closely with the LLM community. This architecture significantly reduces communication and storage overhead, resulting in operating expense that is only 10.6% of traditional recommendation pipelines. Deployed in Kuaishou/Kuaishou Lite APP, it handles 25% of total queries per second, enhancing overall App Stay Time by 0.54% and 1.24%, respectively. Additionally, we have observed significant increases in metrics such as 7-day Lifetime, which is a crucial indicator of recommendation experience.

However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution. MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across 6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning.

State-of-the-art (SOTA) scheduling systems optimize global workload distributions for heterogeneous devices but often suffer from extended scheduling cycles, leading to sub-optimal processing in rapidly changing Edge environments. Local Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables quick adjustments between cycles but faces scalability, knowledge integration, and adaptability issues. Thus, we propose FCPO, which combines Continual RL (CRL) with Federated RL (FRL) to address these challenges. This integration dynamically adjusts inference batch sizes, input resolutions, and multi-threading during pre- and post-processing. CRL allows agents to learn from changing Markov Decision Processes, capturing dynamic environmental variations, while FRL improves generalization and convergence speed by integrating experiences across inference models. FCPO combines these via an agent-specific aggregation scheme and a diversity-aware experience buffer. Experiments on a real-world EVA testbed showed over 5 times improvement in effective throughput, 60% reduced latency, and 20% faster convergence with up to 10 times less memory consumption compared to SOTA RL-based approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Predictive Scaling Laws for Efficient GRPO Training of Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18014v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks using reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a predictive framework that models training dynamics and helps optimize resource usage. Through experiments on Llama and Qwen models (3B 8B), we derive an empirical scaling law based on model size, initial performance, and training progress. This law predicts reward trajectories and identifies three consistent training phases: slow start, rapid improvement, and plateau. We find that training beyond certain number of an epoch offers little gain, suggesting earlier stopping can significantly reduce compute without sacrificing performance. Our approach generalizes across model types, providing a practical guide for efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Their true potential depends on effective alignment to ensure correct, trustworthy and ethical behavior, addressing challenges like misinformation, hallucinations, bias and misuse. While existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based alignment methods are notoriously complex, direct optimization approaches offer a simpler alternative. In this work, we introduce a novel direct optimization approach for LLM alignment by drawing on established Information Retrieval (IR) principles. We present a systematic framework that bridges LLM alignment and IR methodologies, mapping LLM generation and reward models to IR's retriever-reranker paradigm. Building on this foundation, we propose LLM Alignment as Retriever Preference Optimization (LarPO), a new alignment method that enhances overall alignment quality. Extensive experiments validate LarPO's effectiveness with 38.9 % and 13.7 % averaged improvement on AlpacaEval2 and MixEval-Hard respectively. Our work opens new avenues for advancing LLM alignment by integrating IR foundations, offering a promising direction for future research.</p></details> | 26 pages |

Yet existing methods face key limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy: pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning, UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Action-List Reinforcement Learning Syndrome Decoding for Binary Linear Block Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17893v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning techniques to enhance the performance of decoding of linear block codes based on flipping bits and finding optimal decisions. We describe the methodology for mapping the iterative decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and propose different methods to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP is proposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball with a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for reinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to improve the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list decoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values that substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism group of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose a feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing high-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after the existing decoders. These approaches effectively reduces the complexity of the reinforcement learning block. Finally, we present experimental results for the Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes over the Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

Prior work has explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65% compared to the baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rubrics as Rewards: Reinforcement Learning Beyond Verifiable Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17746v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extending Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to real-world tasks often requires balancing objective and subjective evaluation criteria. However, many such tasks lack a single, unambiguous ground truth-making it difficult to define reliable reward signals for post-training language models. While traditional preference-based methods offer a workaround, they rely on opaque reward functions that are difficult to interpret and prone to spurious correlations. We introduce $\textbf{Rubrics as Rewards}$ (RaR), a framework that uses structured, checklist-style rubrics as interpretable reward signals for on-policy training with GRPO. Our best RaR method yields up to a $28\%$ relative improvement on HealthBench-1k compared to simple Likert-based approaches, while matching or surpassing the performance of reward signals derived from expert-written references. By treating rubrics as structured reward signals, we show that RaR enables smaller-scale judge models to better align with human preferences and sustain robust performance across model scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[Megrez2 Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17728v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Megrez2, a novel lightweight and high-performance language model architecture optimized for device native deployment. Megrez2 introduces a novel cross-layer expert sharing mechanism, which significantly reduces total parameter count by reusing expert modules across adjacent transformer layers while maintaining most of the model's capacity. It also incorporates pre-gated routing, enabling memory-efficient expert loading and faster inference. As the first instantiation of the Megrez2 architecture, we introduce the Megrez2-Preview model, which is pre-trained on a 5-trillion-token corpus and further enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. With only 3B activated and 7.5B stored parameters, Megrez2-Preview demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to larger models on a wide range of tasks, including language understanding, instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. These results highlight the effectiveness of the Megrez2 architecture to achieve a balance between accuracy, efficiency, and deployability, making it a strong candidate for real-world, resource-constrained applications.</p></details> |  |

We propose the \textit{Single-Step Completion Policy} (SSCP), a generative policy trained with an augmented flow-matching objective to predict direct completion vectors from intermediate flow samples, enabling accurate, one-shot action generation. In an off-policy actor-critic framework, SSCP combines the expressiveness of generative models with the training and inference efficiency of unimodal policies, without requiring long backpropagation chains. Our method scales effectively to offline, offline-to-online, and online RL settings, offering substantial gains in speed and adaptability over diffusion-based baselines. We further extend SSCP to goal-conditioned RL, enabling flat policies to exploit subgoal structures without explicit hierarchical inference. SSCP achieves strong results across standard offline RL and behavior cloning benchmarks, positioning it as a versatile, expressive, and efficient framework for deep RL and sequential decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v7)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Should We Meta-Learn Reinforcement Learning Algorithms?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17668v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The process of meta-learning algorithms from data, instead of relying on manual design, is growing in popularity as a paradigm for improving the performance of machine learning systems. Meta-learning shows particular promise for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are often adapted from supervised or unsupervised learning despite their suboptimality for RL. However, until now there has been a severe lack of comparison between different meta-learning algorithms, such as using evolution to optimise over black-box functions or LLMs to propose code. In this paper, we carry out this empirical comparison of the different approaches when applied to a range of meta-learned algorithms which target different parts of the RL pipeline. In addition to meta-train and meta-test performance, we also investigate factors including the interpretability, sample cost and train time for each meta-learning algorithm. Based on these findings, we propose several guidelines for meta-learning new RL algorithms which will help ensure that future learned algorithms are as performant as possible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper at Reinforcement Learning Conference (RLC) 2025</p></details> |

Existing deep learning methods have made progress but still face limitations in handling complex scenes and preserving image details. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based latent diffusion model (LDM) fine-tuning method for remote sensing image super-resolution. The method constructs a reinforcement learning environment with states, actions, and rewards, optimizing decision objectives through proximal policy optimization (PPO) during the reverse denoising process of the LDM model. Experiments on the RESISC45 dataset show significant improvements over the baseline model in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, with PSNR increasing by 3-4dB, SSIM improving by 0.08-0.11, and LPIPS reducing by 0.06-0.10, particularly in structured and complex natural scenes.

| **[CodeReasoner: Enhancing the Code Reasoning Ability with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17548v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code reasoning is a fundamental capability for large language models (LLMs) in the code domain. It involves understanding and predicting a program's execution behavior, such as determining the output for a given input or whether a specific statement will be executed. This capability is essential for downstream tasks like debugging, code generation, and program repair. Prior approaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning to improve performance in code reasoning tasks. However, they often show limited gains and fail to generalize across diverse scenarios. We argue this is due to two core issues: the low quality of training data and the limitations of supervised fine-tuning, which struggles to teach general reasoning skills. To address these challenges, we propose CodeReasoner, a framework that spans both dataset construction and a two-stage training process. First, we introduce a method to construct datasets that focus on the core execution logic of Python programs. Next, we apply instruction tuning to inject execution-specific knowledge distilled from a powerful teacher model. We then enhance reasoning and generalization through GRPO reinforcement learning on top of the fine-tuned model. Experiments on three widely-used code reasoning benchmarks show that CodeReasoner improves performance by 27.1% to 40.2% over prior methods using a 7B model. Notably, the 7B model matches GPT-4o on key tasks like input/output and coverage prediction. When scaled to 14B, CodeReasoner outperforms GPT-4o across all benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each training stage and highlight the importance of reasoning chains.</p></details> |  |

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible benchmark for future studies.

| **[Generalized Advantage Estimation for Distributional Policy Gradients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17530v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) has been used to mitigate the computational complexity of reinforcement learning (RL) by employing an exponentially weighted estimation of the advantage function to reduce the variance in policy gradient estimates. Despite its effectiveness, GAE is not designed to handle value distributions integral to distributional RL, which can capture the inherent stochasticity in systems and is hence more robust to system noises. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that utilizes the optimal transport theory to introduce a Wasserstein-like directional metric, which measures both the distance and the directional discrepancies between probability distributions. Using the exponentially weighted estimation, we leverage this Wasserstein-like directional metric to derive distributional GAE (DGAE). Similar to traditional GAE, our proposed DGAE provides a low-variance advantage estimate with controlled bias, making it well-suited for policy gradient algorithms that rely on advantage estimation for policy updates. We integrated DGAE into three different policy gradient methods. Algorithms were evaluated across various OpenAI Gym environments and compared with the baselines with traditional GAE to assess the performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, published at ACC 2025 Conference</p></details> |

We propose a model-free, data-driven exploration mechanism that adaptively adjusts entropy regularization by the critic and policy variance by the actor. Unlike the constant or deterministic exploration schedules employed in \cite{huang2024sublinear}, which require extensive tuning for implementations and ignore learning progresses during iterations, our adaptive exploratory approach boosts learning efficiency with minimal tuning. Despite its flexibility, our method achieves a sublinear regret bound that matches the best-known model-free results for this class of LQ problems, which were previously derived only with fixed exploration schedules. Numerical experiments demonstrate that adaptive explorations accelerate convergence and improve regret performance compared to the non-adaptive model-free and model-based counterparts.</p></details> | 37 pages, 10 figures |
| **[URPO: A Unified Reward & Policy Optimization Framework for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17515v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale alignment pipelines typically pair a policy model with a separately trained reward model whose parameters remain frozen during reinforcement learning (RL). This separation creates a complex, resource-intensive pipeline and suffers from a performance ceiling due to a static reward signal. We propose a novel framework, Unified Reward & Policy Optimization (URPO), that unifies instruction-following ("player") and reward modeling ("referee") within a single model and a single training phase. Our method recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable reasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format optimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This enables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic while simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks. Experiments on the Qwen2.5-7B model demonstrate URPO's superiority. Our unified model significantly outperforms a strong baseline using a separate generative reward model, boosting the instruction-following score on AlpacaEval from 42.24 to 44.84 and the composite reasoning average from 32.66 to 35.66. Furthermore, URPO cultivates a superior internal evaluator as a byproduct of training, achieving a RewardBench score of 85.15 and surpassing the dedicated reward model it replaces (83.55). By eliminating the need for a separate reward model and fostering a co-evolutionary dynamic between generation and evaluation, URPO presents a simpler, more efficient, and more effective path towards robustly aligned language models.</p></details> |  |

A Data-Centric Study on Multi-Domain Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17512v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing research has predominantly concentrated on isolated reasoning domains such as mathematical problem-solving, coding tasks, or logical reasoning. However, real world reasoning scenarios inherently demand an integrated application of multiple cognitive skills. Despite this, the interplay among these reasoning skills under reinforcement learning remains poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic investigation of multi-domain reasoning within the RLVR framework, explicitly focusing on three primary domains: mathematical reasoning, code generation, and logical puzzle solving. We conduct a comprehensive study comprising four key components: (1) Leveraging the GRPO algorithm and the Qwen-2.5-7B model family, our study thoroughly evaluates the models' in-domain improvements and cross-domain generalization capabilities when trained on single-domain datasets. (2) Additionally, we examine the intricate interactions including mutual enhancements and conflicts that emerge during combined cross-domain training. (3) To further understand the influence of SFT on RL, we also analyze and compare performance differences between base and instruct models under identical RL configurations. (4) Furthermore, we delve into critical RL training details, systematically exploring the impacts of curriculum learning strategies, variations in reward design, and language-specific factors. Through extensive experiments, our results offer significant insights into the dynamics governing domain interactions, revealing key factors influencing both specialized and generalizable reasoning performance. These findings provide valuable guidance for optimizing RL methodologies to foster comprehensive, multi-domain reasoning capabilities in LLMs.</p></details> | 27 pages, 24 figures |

However, their performance degrades when handling real-world applications that involve complex multi-image compositions and multi-modal instructions, revealing limitations in cross-image reasoning and generalization. To address these challenges, we adopt a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based post-training strategy to improve the reasoning of MLLMs in multi-image grounding tasks. Our approach begins with synthesizing high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data for cold-start initialization, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). The cold-start training stage enables the model to identify correct solutions. Subsequently, we perform rejection sampling using the merged SFT model to curate high-quality RL data and leverage rule-based RL to guide the model toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, yielding improvements of +9.04% on MIG-Bench, +6.37% on MC-Bench, and +4.98% on several out-of-domain reasoning grounding benchmarks compared to the SFT baseline. Furthermore, our method exhibits strong generalization in multi-image perception, with gains of +3.1% and +2.4% over the base model on BLINK and MMIU benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Nevertheless, existing methods frequently face limitations in both applicability and explainability. Traditional graph-based and sequence-to-sequence models often lack generalized chemical knowledge, leading to predictions that are neither consistently accurate nor easily explainable. To address these challenges, we introduce RetroDFM-R, a reasoning-based large language model (LLM) designed specifically for chemical retrosynthesis. Leveraging large-scale reinforcement learning guided by chemically verifiable rewards, RetroDFM-R significantly enhances prediction accuracy and explainability. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that RetroDFM-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a top-1 accuracy of 65.0% on the USPTO-50K benchmark. Double-blind human assessments further validate the chemical plausibility and practical utility of RetroDFM-R's predictions. RetroDFM-R also accurately predicts multistep retrosynthetic routes reported in the literature for both real-world drug molecules and perovskite materials. Crucially, the model's explicit reasoning process provides human-interpretable insights, thereby enhancing trust and practical value in real-world retrosynthesis applications.</p></details> | Preprint |

Participatory budgeting requires voters to make decisions on projects which can lead to ``choice overload". A multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to decision support can make decision making easier for voters by identifying voting strategies that increase the winning proportion of their vote. This novel approach can also support policymakers by highlighting aspects of election design that enable fair compromise on projects. This paper presents a novel, ethically aligned approach to decision support using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning modelling. This paper introduces a novel use of a branching neural network architecture to overcome scalability challenges of multi-agent reinforcement learning in a decentralized way. Fair compromises are found through optimising voter actions towards greater representation of voter preferences in the winning set. Experimental evaluation with real-world participatory budgeting data reveals a pattern in fair compromise: that it is achievable through projects with smaller cost.</p></details> |  |

The method alternates between solving linear second-order PDEs under fixed feedback policies and updating the controls via pointwise minimax optimization using automatic differentiation. Under standard Lipschitz and uniform ellipticity assumptions, we prove that the value function iterates converge locally uniformly to the unique viscosity solution of the HJI equation. The analysis establishes equi-Lipschitz regularity of the iterates, enabling provable stability and convergence without requiring convexity of the Hamiltonian. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of the method. In a two-dimensional stochastic path-planning game with a moving obstacle, our method matches finite-difference benchmarks with relative $L^2$-errors below %10^{-2}%. In five- and ten-dimensional publisher-subscriber differential games with anisotropic noise, the proposed approach consistently outperforms direct PINN solvers, yielding smoother value functions and lower residuals. Our results suggest that integrating PINNs with policy iteration is a practical and theoretically grounded method for solving high-dimensional, nonconvex HJI equations, with potential applications in robotics, finance, and multi-agent reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

However, these systems still face significant challenges in practical applications, particularly in generating factually inconsistent intermediate queries and inefficient search trajectories, which can lead to reasoning deviations or redundant computations. To address these issues, we propose DynaSearcher, an innovative search agent enhanced by dynamic knowledge graphs and multi-reward reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our system leverages knowledge graphs as external structured knowledge to guide the search process by explicitly modeling entity relationships, thereby ensuring factual consistency in intermediate queries and mitigating biases from irrelevant information. Furthermore, we employ a multi-reward RL framework for fine-grained control over training objectives such as retrieval accuracy, efficiency, and response quality. This framework promotes the generation of high-quality intermediate queries and comprehensive final answers, while discouraging unnecessary exploration and minimizing information omissions or redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art answer accuracy on six multi-hop question answering datasets, matching frontier LLMs while using only small-scale models and limited computational resources. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong generalization and robustness across diverse retrieval environments and larger-scale models, highlighting its broad applicability.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Accelerated Aerodynamic Shape Optimisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17786v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive optimization algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization focused on dimensionality reduction. The form in which RL is applied here is that of a surrogate-based, actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach allowing for temporal 'freezing' of some of the parameters to be optimized. The goals are to minimize computational effort, and to use the observed optimization results for interpretation of the discovered extrema in terms of their role in achieving the desired flow-field. By a sequence of local optimized parameter changes around intermediate CFD simulations acting as ground truth, it is possible to speed up the global optimization if (a) the local neighbourhoods of the parameters in which the changed parameters must reside are sufficiently large to compete with the grid-sized steps and its large number of simulations, and (b) the estimates of the rewards and costs on these neighbourhoods necessary for a good step-wise parameter adaption are sufficiently accurate. We give an example of a simple fluid-dynamical problem on which the method allows interpretation in the sense of a feature importance scoring.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages a graph neural network trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to efficiently estimate the robot's cost-to-go, formulated as local goal recommendations. A spatio-temporal path-searching module, which accounts for kinematic constraints, is then employed to generate a reference trajectory to facilitate solving the non-convex optimization problem used for explicit constraint enforcement. More importantly, we introduce an incremental action-masking mechanism and a privileged learning strategy, enabling end-to-end training of the proposed planner. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses local planning in complex dynamic environments, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Compared with existing learning-optimization hybrid methods, our approach eliminates the dependency on high-fidelity simulation environments, offering significant advantages in computational efficiency and training scalability. The code will be released as open-source upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |

However, retrieval noises significantly impact the quality of LLMs' generation, necessitating the development of denoising mechanisms. Previous methods extract evidence straightforwardly without explicit thinking, which risks filtering out key clues and struggles with generalization. To this end, we propose LEAR, which learns to extract rational evidence by (1) explicitly reasoning to identify potential cues within retrieval contents first, and then (2) consciously extracting to avoid omitting any key cues helpful for answering questions. Specifically, we frame evidence reasoning and evidence extraction into one unified response for end-to-end training; apply knowledge token masks for disentanglement to derive reasoning-based and extraction-based answers; and devise three types of verifiable reward functions, including answer, length, and format, to update the model via the policy optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of LEAR, providing compact and high-quality evidence, improving the accuracy of downstream tasks, and promoting effective application in online RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 Figures, 10 Tables</p></details> |

While "aha moment" patterns--where models exhibit self-correction through reflection--are often attributed to emergent properties from RL, we first demonstrate that these patterns exist in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) prior to RL training but may not necessarily correlate with improved reasoning performance. Building on these insights, we present a comprehensive study on enhancing multimodal reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start with structured chain-of-thought reasoning patterns, followed by (2) reinforcement learning via GRPO to further refine these capabilities. Our extensive experiments show that this combined approach consistently outperforms both SFT-only and RL-only methods across challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks. The resulting models achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs at both 3B and 7B scales, with our 7B model showing substantial improvements over base models (e.g., 66.3 %$\rightarrow$73.4 % on MathVista, 62.9 %$\rightarrow$70.4 % on We-Math) and our 3B model achieving performance competitive with several 7B models. Overall, this work provides practical guidance for building advanced multimodal reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/waltonfuture/RL-with-Cold-Start.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prolonging Tool Life: Learning Skillful Use of General-purpose Tools through Lifespan-guided Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17275v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In inaccessible environments with uncertain task demands, robots often rely on general-purpose tools that lack predefined usage strategies. These tools are not tailored for particular operations, making their longevity highly sensitive to how they are used. This creates a fundamental challenge: how can a robot learn a tool-use policy that both completes the task and prolongs the tool's lifespan? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that incorporates tool lifespan as a factor during policy optimization. Our framework leverages Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Miner's Rule to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based on accumulated stress, and integrates the RUL into the RL reward to guide policy learning toward lifespan-guided behavior. To handle the fact that RUL can only be estimated after task execution, we introduce an Adaptive Reward Normalization (ARN) mechanism that dynamically adjusts reward scaling based on estimated RULs, ensuring stable learning signals. We validate our method across simulated and real-world tool use tasks, including Object-Moving and Door-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools. The learned policies consistently prolong tool lifespan (up to 8.01x in simulation) and transfer effectively to real-world settings, demonstrating the practical value of learning lifespan-guided tool use strategies.</p></details> | Under review |

While recent progress in natural language processing and large multimodal models has enhanced robots' ability to understand complex instructions, robot manipulation still faces the procedural skill dilemma and the declarative skill dilemma in open environments. Existing methods often compromise cognitive and executive capabilities. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose RoBridge, a hierarchical intelligent architecture for general robotic manipulation. It consists of a high-level cognitive planner (HCP) based on a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), an invariant operable representation (IOR) serving as a symbolic bridge, and a generalist embodied agent (GEA). RoBridge maintains the declarative skill of VLM and unleashes the procedural skill of reinforcement learning, effectively bridging the gap between cognition and execution. RoBridge demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing baselines, achieving a 75% success rate on new tasks and an 83% average success rate in sim-to-real generalization using only five real-world data samples per task. This work represents a significant step towards integrating cognitive reasoning with physical execution in robotic systems, offering a new paradigm for general robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://abliao.github.io/RoBridge/</p></details> |
| **[AlignDistil: Token-Level Language Model Alignment as Adaptive Policy Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02832v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern large language models (LLMs), LLM alignment is of crucial importance and is typically achieved through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO). However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation. The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization. Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct an appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Main Conference, code available at: https://github.com/songmzhang/AlignDistil</p></details> |

However, achieving effective coordination in distributed multi-agent environments remains challenging due to (1) misalignment between instructions and task requirements and (2) inconsistency in robot behaviors when they independently interpret ambiguous instructions. To address these challenges, we propose Instruction-Conditioned Coordinator (ICCO), a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework designed to enhance coordination in language-guided multi-robot systems. ICCO consists of a Coordinator agent and multiple Local Agents, where the Coordinator generates Task-Aligned and Consistent Instructions (TACI) by integrating language instructions with environmental states, ensuring task alignment and behavioral consistency. The Coordinator and Local Agents are jointly trained to optimize a reward function that balances task efficiency and instruction following. A Consistency Enhancement Term is added to the learning objective to maximize mutual information between instructions and robot behaviors, further improving coordination. Simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of ICCO in achieving language-guided task-aligned multi-robot control.

Unlike prior studies that assume uniform UAV capabilities or overlook energy-security trade-offs, we consider a realistic scenario where UAVs with diverse payloads and computation resources collaborate to serve ground terminals in the presence of eavesdroppers. To manage the complex coupling between UAV motion and communication, we propose a hierarchical optimization framework. The inner layer uses a semidefinite relaxation (SDR)-based S2DC algorithm combining penalty functions and difference-of-convex (d.c.) programming to solve the secrecy precoding problem with fixed UAV positions. The outer layer introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided heuristic multi-agent reinforcement learning approach (LLM-HeMARL) for trajectory optimization. LLM-HeMARL efficiently incorporates expert heuristics policy generated by the LLM, enabling UAVs to learn energy-aware, security-driven trajectories without the inference overhead of real-time LLM calls. The simulation results show that our method outperforms existing baselines in secrecy rate and energy efficiency, with consistent robustness across varying UAV swarm sizes and random seeds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically rely on prompt engineering or supervised fine-tuning to enable models to imitate character behaviors in specific scenarios, but often neglect the underlying \emph{cognitive} mechanisms driving these behaviors. Inspired by cognitive psychology, we introduce \textbf{CogDual}, a novel RPLA adopting a \textit{cognize-then-respond } reasoning paradigm. By jointly modeling external situational awareness and internal self-awareness, CogDual generates responses with improved character consistency and contextual alignment. To further optimize the performance, we employ reinforcement learning with two general-purpose reward schemes designed for open-domain text generation. Extensive experiments on the CoSER benchmark, as well as Cross-MR and LifeChoice, demonstrate that CogDual consistently outperforms existing baselines and generalizes effectively across diverse role-playing tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DistFlow: A Fully Distributed RL Framework for Scalable and Efficient LLM Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13833v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the pivotal post-training technique for large language model. Effectively scaling reinforcement learning is now the key to unlocking advanced reasoning capabilities and ensuring safe, goal-aligned behavior in the most powerful LLMs. Mainstream frameworks usually employ a hybrid-controller architecture where a single-controller dispatches the overall execution logic and manages overall data transfer and the multi-controller executes distributed computation. For large-scale reinforcement learning, minor load imbalances can introduce significant bottlenecks, ultimately constraining the scalability of the system. To address this limitation, we introduce DistFlow, a novel, fully distributed RL framework designed to break scaling barrier. We adopt a multi-controller paradigm that dispatches data transfer and execution tasks to all workers, which eliminates the centralized node. This allows each worker to operate independently, leading to near-linear scalability up to thousands of GPUs and dramatic efficiency gains. Furthermore, our architecture decouples resource configuration from execution logic, allowing each worker to have a unique execution flow, offering significant flexibility for rapid and cost-effective algorithmic experimentation. Extensive experiments show that DistFlow achieves excellent linear scalability and up to a 7x end-to-end throughput improvement over state-of-the-art (SOTA) frameworks.</p></details> |  |

While it is often assumed that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's parameters, we challenge this assumption with a surprising finding: RL fine-tuning consistently modifies only a small subnetwork (typically 5-30% of weights), leaving most parameters unchanged. We call this phenomenon RL-induced parameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity constraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI, Meta, and open-source LLMs). Moreover, the subnetworks updated by RL show substantial overlap across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms-far exceeding chance-suggesting a partially transferable structure in the pretrained model. We show that fine-tuning only this sparse subnetwork recovers full model performance and yields parameters nearly identical to the fully fine-tuned model. Our analysis suggests this sparsity emerges because RL operates near the model's original distribution, requiring only targeted changes. KL penalties, gradient clipping, and on-policy dynamics have limited effect on the sparsity pattern. These findings shed new light on how RL adapts models: not by shifting all weights, but by focusing training on a small, consistently updated subnetwork. This insight enables more efficient RL methods and reframes sparsity through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

A potential solution must address the limited capacity for realistic model synthesis, high uncertainty in perception, and the lack of efficient spatial abstractions, among others. We propose a novel framework for learning model-free policies integrating two modalities: 3D point clouds and proprioceptive touch indicators, emphasising manipulation with full body contact awareness, going beyond traditional end-effector modes. Our reinforcement learning framework leverages a distributional state representation, aided by kernel mean embeddings, to achieve improved training efficiency and real-time inference. Furthermore, we propose a novel context-agnostic occlusion heuristic to clear deformables from a target region for exposure tasks. We deploy the framework in a power line clearance scenario and observe that the agent generates creative strategies leveraging multiple arm links for de-occlusion. Finally, we perform zero-shot sim-to-real policy transfer, allowing the arm to clear real branches with unknown occlusion patterns, unseen topology, and uncertain dynamics.</p></details> |  |

However, a critical question remains: How robust are DRL models when exposed to adversarial attacks? While existing defense mechanisms such as adversarial training and distillation enhance the resilience of DRL models, there remains a significant research gap regarding the integration of multiple defenses in autonomous driving scenarios specifically. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel ensemble-based defense architecture to mitigate adversarial attacks in autonomous driving. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed architecture significantly enhances the robustness of DRL models. Compared to the baseline under FGSM attacks, our ensemble method improves the mean reward from 5.87 to 18.38 (over 213% increase) and reduces the mean collision rate from 0.50 to 0.09 (an 82% decrease) in the highway scenario and merge scenario, outperforming all standalone defense strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

The problem is defined as multiple depot pickup and delivery with time windows constrained over operational restrictions, such as vehicle battery limitation, precedence time window, and building obstruction. Utilizing the coalition game theory, we investigate cooperation structures among the modes to capture how strategic collaboration can improve overall routing efficiency. To do so, a generalized reinforcement learning model is designed to evaluate the cost-sharing and allocation to different modes to learn the cooperative behaviour with respect to various realistic scenarios. Our methodology leverages an end-to-end deep multi-agent policy gradient method augmented by a novel spatio-temporal adjacency neighbourhood graph attention network using a heterogeneous edge-enhanced attention model and transformer architecture. Several numerical experiments on last-mile delivery applications have been conducted, showing the results from the case study in the city of Mississauga, which shows that despite the incorporation of an extensive network in the graph for two modes and a complex training structure, the model addresses realistic operational constraints and achieves high-quality solutions compared with the existing transformer-based and classical methods. It can perform well on non-homogeneous data distribution, generalizes well on different scales and configurations, and demonstrates a robust cooperative performance under stochastic scenarios across various tasks, which is effectively reflected by coalition analysis and cost allocation to signify the advantage of cooperation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pragmatic Policy Development via Interpretable Behavior Cloning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17056v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for deriving optimal policies from observational data, but challenges related to interpretability and evaluation limit its practical use in safety-critical domains. Interpretability is hindered by the black-box nature of unconstrained RL policies, while evaluation -- typically performed off-policy -- is sensitive to large deviations from the data-collecting behavior policy, especially when using methods based on importance sampling. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet practical alternative: deriving treatment policies from the most frequently chosen actions in each patient state, as estimated by an interpretable model of the behavior policy. By using a tree-based model, which is specifically designed to exploit patterns in the data, we obtain a natural grouping of states with respect to treatment. The tree structure ensures interpretability by design, while varying the number of actions considered controls the degree of overlap with the behavior policy, enabling reliable off-policy evaluation. This pragmatic approach to policy development standardizes frequent treatment patterns, capturing the collective clinical judgment embedded in the data. Using real-world examples in rheumatoid arthritis and sepsis care, we demonstrate that policies derived under this framework can outperform current practice, offering interpretable alternatives to those obtained via offline RL.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art work showed the potential of shared control in improving safety in navigation for non-holonomic robots. However, for holonomic systems, current approaches often lead to unintuitive behavior for the user and fail to utilize the full potential of omnidirectional driving. Therefore, we propose a reinforcement learning-based method, which takes a 2D user input and outputs a 3D motion while ensuring user comfort and reducing cognitive load on the driver. Our approach is trained in Isaac Gym and tested in simulation in Gazebo. We compare different RL agent architectures and reward functions based on metrics considering cognitive load and user comfort. We show that our method ensures collision-free navigation while smartly orienting the wheelchair and showing better or competitive smoothness compared to a previous non-learning-based method. We further perform a sim-to-real transfer and demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first real-world implementation of RL-based shared control for an omnidirectional mobility platform.</p></details> |  |

While text-based reasoning models (e.g., Deepseek R1) show promising results in text-only tasks, distilling their reasoning into LVLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often results in performance degradation due to imprecise visual grounding. Conversely, purely reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods face a large search space, hindering the emergence of reflective behaviors in smaller models (e.g., 7B LVLMs). Surprisingly, alternating between SFT and RL ultimately results in significant performance improvements after a few iterations. Our analysis reveals that the base model rarely exhibits reasoning behaviors initially, but SFT effectively surfaces these latent actions and narrows the RL search space, accelerating the development of reasoning capabilities. Each subsequent RL stage further refines the model's reasoning skills, producing higher-quality SFT data for continued self-improvement. OpenVLThinker-7B consistently advances performance across six benchmarks demanding mathematical and general reasoning, notably improving MathVista by 3.8%, EMMA by 2.4%, and HallusionBench by 1.6%. Beyond demonstrating the synergy between SFT and RL for complex reasoning tasks, our findings provide early evidence towards achieving R1-style reasoning in multimodal contexts.

The key of the proposed methodology is to better explore the solution space by simulating and composing the stochastic processes using pre-trained deep learning (DL) models. We demonstrate our approach on a challenging real-world application, the multi-sourcing multi-period inventory management problem in supply chain optimization. In particular, we employ deep RL models for learning and forecasting the stochastic supply chain processes under a range of assumptions. Moreover, we also introduce a constraint coordination mechanism, designed to forecast dual costs given the cross-products constraints in the inventory network. We highlight that instead of directly modeling the complex physical constraints into the RL optimization problem and solving the stochastic problem as a whole, our approach breaks down those supply chain processes into scalable and composable DL modules, leading to improved performance on large real-world datasets. We also outline open problems for future research to further investigate the efficacy of such models.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Learning Approach to Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00227v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a unified framework for a more detailed exploration of games. In existing literature, strategies of players are typically assigned scalar values, and the concept of Nash equilibrium is used to identify compatible strategies. However, this approach lacks the internal structure of a player, thereby failing to accurately model observed behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose an abstract definition of a player. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of players and brings the focus to the challenge of learning that players face. Unlike Markov decision processes, which formalize control problems but not agent design, our framework subsumes standard reinforcement learning structures. It thus offers a language that enables a deeper connection between games and learning. To illustrate the need for such generality, we study a simple two-player game and show that even in the most basic settings, a sophisticated player may adopt dynamic strategies that cannot be captured by simpler designs or compatibility analysis alone. In the discrete setting, we consider a player whose structure incorporates standard estimates from the literature. We explore connections to correlated equilibrium and highlight that dynamic programming naturally applies to all estimates. In the mean-field setting, we exploit symmetry to construct explicit examples of equilibria. Finally, we examine connections to reinforcement learning and bandit problems, demonstrating the broad applicability of the framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 2 figures.

In this work, we explore the use of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) to develop adaptive control strategies for lower-limb exoskeletons, aiming to enhance mobility and autonomy for individuals with motor impairments. Inspired by prominent models of biological sensorimotor processing, our investigated HRL approach breaks down the complex task of exoskeleton control adaptation into a higher-level framework for terrain strategy adaptation and a lower-level framework for providing predictive information; this latter element is implemented via the continual learning of general value functions (GVFs). GVFs generated temporal abstractions of future signal values from multiple wearable lower-limb sensors, including electromyography, pressure insoles, and goniometers. We investigated two methods for incorporating actual and predicted sensor signals into a policy network with the intent to improve the decision-making capacity of the control system of a lower-limb exoskeleton during ambulation across varied terrains. As a key result, we found that the addition of predictions made from GVFs increased overall network accuracy. Terrain-specific performance increases were seen while walking on even ground, uneven ground, up and down ramps, and turns, terrains that are often misclassified without predictive information. This suggests that predictive information can aid decision-making during uncertainty, e.g., on terrains that have a high chance of being misclassified. This work, therefore, contributes new insights into the nuances of HRL and the future development of exoskeletons to facilitate safe transitioning and traversing across different walking environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, accepted at the 6th Multi-disciplinary Conference on Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making (RLDM2025), June 11-14, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Harnessing RLHF for Robust Unanswerability Recognition and Trustworthy Response Generation in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16951v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational Information Retrieval (CIR) systems, while offering intuitive access to information, face a significant challenge: reliably handling unanswerable questions to prevent the generation of misleading or hallucinated content. Traditional approaches often rely on external classifiers, which can introduce inconsistencies with the core generative Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper introduces Self-Aware LLM for Unanswerability (SALU), a novel approach that deeply integrates unanswerability detection directly within the LLM's generative process. SALU is trained using a multi-task learning framework for both standard Question Answering (QA) and explicit abstention generation for unanswerable queries. Crucially, it incorporates a confidence-score-guided reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) phase, which explicitly penalizes hallucinated responses and rewards appropriate abstentions, fostering intrinsic self-awareness of knowledge boundaries. Through extensive experiments on our custom-built C-IR_Answerability dataset, SALU consistently outperforms strong baselines, including hybrid LLM-classifier systems, in overall accuracy for correctly answering or abstaining from questions. Human evaluation further confirms SALU's superior reliability, achieving high scores in factuality, appropriate abstention, and, most importantly, a dramatic reduction in hallucination, demonstrating its ability to robustly "know when to say 'I don't know'."</p></details> |  |

Using software-in-the-loop (SIL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL), an RL-trained artificial intelligence (AI) controller is developed using a digital twin (DT) in simulation and subsequently verified in physical experiments. An underwater motion capture (MOCAP) system provides real-time 3D position and orientation feedback during verification testing for precise synchronization between the digital and physical domains. A key novelty of this approach is the combined use of a general-purpose game engine for simulation, deep RL, and real-time underwater motion capture for an effective zero-shot sim-to-real strategy.</p></details> |  |

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple, yet effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Synthetic preference data with its low cost and high quality enable effective alignment through single- or multi-model generated preference data. Our study reveals a striking, safety-specific phenomenon associated with DPO alignment: Although multi-model generated data enhances performance on general tasks (ARC, Hellaswag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, Winogrande) by providing diverse responses, it also tends to facilitate reward hacking during training. This can lead to a high attack success rate (ASR) when models encounter jailbreaking prompts. The issue is particularly pronounced when employing stronger models like GPT-4o or larger models in the same family to generate chosen responses paired with target model self-generated rejected responses, resulting in dramatically poorer safety outcomes. Furthermore, with respect to safety, using solely self-generated responses (single-model generation) for both chosen and rejected pairs significantly outperforms configurations that incorporate responses from stronger models, whether used directly as chosen data or as part of a multi-model response pool. We demonstrate that multi-model preference data exhibits high linear separability between chosen and rejected responses, which allows models to exploit superficial cues rather than internalizing robust safety constraints. Our experiments, conducted on models from the Llama, Mistral, and Qwen families, consistently validate these findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version includes updated results and expanded discussion</p></details> |
| **[Semi-off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language Slow-thinking Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16814v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing large vision-language models (LVLMs) with visual slow-thinking reasoning is crucial for solving complex multimodal tasks. However, since LVLMs are mainly trained with vision-language alignment, it is difficult to adopt on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) to develop the slow thinking ability because the rollout space is restricted by its initial abilities. Off-policy RL offers a way to go beyond the current policy, but directly distilling trajectories from external models may cause visual hallucinations due to mismatched visual perception abilities across models. To address these issues, this paper proposes SOPHIA, a simple and scalable Semi-Off-Policy RL for vision-language slow-tHInking reAsoning. SOPHIA builds a semi-off-policy behavior model by combining on-policy visual understanding from a trainable LVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model, assigns outcome-based rewards to reasoning, and propagates visual rewards backward. Then LVLM learns slow-thinking reasoning ability from the obtained reasoning trajectories using propagated rewards via off-policy RL algorithms. Extensive experiments with InternVL2.5 and InternVL3.0 with 8B and 38B sizes show the effectiveness of SOPHIA. Notably, SOPHIA improves InternVL3.0-38B by 8.50% in average, reaching state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, and even outperforms some closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4.1) on the challenging MathVision and OlympiadBench, achieving 49.08% and 49.95% pass@1 accuracy, respectively. Analysis shows SOPHIA outperforms supervised fine-tuning and direct on-policy RL methods, offering a better policy initialization for further on-policy training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Binary Rewards: Training LMs to Reason About Their Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16806v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When language models (LMs) are trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to generate natural language "reasoning chains", their performance improves on a variety of difficult question answering tasks. Today, almost all successful applications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the correctness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize guessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect of degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate incorrect responses (or "hallucinate") in other problem domains. This paper describes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach to training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated confidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical confidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward function that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a scoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction. We first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that uses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both accurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR substantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and classifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL hurts calibration, RLCR improves it. Finally, we demonstrate that verbalized confidence can be leveraged at test time to improve accuracy and calibration via confidence-weighted scaling methods. Our results show that explicitly optimizing for calibration can produce more generally reliable reasoning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Knowledge Transformers for Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16796v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel framework for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading that integrates uncertainty-aware prediction with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), addressing a critical gap in current literature. In contrast to previous works relying on deterministic forecasts, the proposed approach employs a heteroscedastic probabilistic transformer-based prediction model called Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty (KTU) to explicitly quantify prediction uncertainty, which is essential for robust decision-making in the stochastic environment of P2P energy trading. The KTU model leverages domain-specific features and is trained with a custom loss function that ensures reliable probabilistic forecasts and confidence intervals for each prediction. Integrating these uncertainty-aware forecasts into the MARL framework enables agents to optimize trading strategies with a clear understanding of risk and variability. Experimental results show that the uncertainty-aware Deep Q-Network (DQN) reduces energy purchase costs by up to 5.7% without P2P trading and 3.2% with P2P trading, while increasing electricity sales revenue by 6.4% and 44.7%, respectively. Additionally, peak hour grid demand is reduced by 38.8% without P2P and 45.6% with P2P. These improvements are even more pronounced when P2P trading is enabled, highlighting the synergy between advanced forecasting and market mechanisms for resilient, economically efficient energy communities.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, Proceedings of the Main Track of the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025), October 25-30, 2025</p></details> |

Current reinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as hit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature of spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally forms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI Gaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G$^2$), a principled reward framework that models GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface plane. GUI-G$^2$ incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point rewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions centered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment by measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target regions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance mechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions. This framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to dense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich gradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions. Extensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro benchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G$^2$, substantially outperforms state-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of 24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro. Our analysis reveals that continuous modeling provides superior robustness to interface variations and enhanced generalization to unseen layouts, establishing a new paradigm for spatial reasoning in GUI interaction tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zebra-CoT: A Dataset for Interleaved Vision Language Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16746v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans often use visual aids, for example diagrams or sketches, when solving complex problems. Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual Chain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf visual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack of high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce $\textbf{Zebra-CoT}$, a diverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent interleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks where sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific questions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks like visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D multi-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and strategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations. Fine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved visual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoT's effectiveness for developing multimodal reasoning abilities. We open-source our dataset and models to support development and evaluation of visual CoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>datas...</summary><p>dataset link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/multimodal-reasoning-lab/Zebra-CoT</p></details> |
| **[R1-Track: Direct Application of MLLMs to Visual Object Tracking via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21980v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual single object tracking aims to continuously localize and estimate the scale of a target in subsequent video frames, given only its initial state in the first frame. This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters, two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets, and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly. Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However, experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities. And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Adaptive Inventory Strategies using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Agri-Food Supply Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16670v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agricultural products are often subject to seasonal fluctuations in production and demand. Predicting and managing inventory levels in response to these variations can be challenging, leading to either excess inventory or stockouts. Additionally, the coordination among stakeholders at various level of food supply chain is not considered in the existing body of literature. To bridge these research gaps, this study focuses on inventory management of agri-food products under demand and lead time uncertainties. By implementing effective inventory replenishment policy results in maximize the overall profit throughout the supply chain. However, the complexity of the problem increases due to these uncertainties and shelf-life of the product, that makes challenging to implement traditional approaches to generate optimal set of solutions. Thus, the current study propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm that combines the benefits of both value- and policy-based DRL approaches for inventory optimization under uncertainties. The proposed algorithm can incentivize collaboration among stakeholders by aligning their interests and objectives through shared optimization goal of maximizing profitability along the agri-food supply chain while considering perishability, and uncertainty simultaneously. By selecting optimal order quantities with continuous action space, the proposed algorithm effectively addresses the inventory optimization challenges. To rigorously evaluate this algorithm, the empirical data from fresh agricultural products supply chain inventory is considered. Experimental results corroborate the improved performance of the proposed inventory replenishment policy under stochastic demand patterns and lead time scenarios. The research findings hold managerial implications for policymakers to manage the inventory of agricultural products more effectively under uncertainty.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces FOGNITE Fog-based Grid In intelligence with Neural Integration and Twin based Execution a next-generation fog cloud framework designed to enhance autonomy, resilience, and efficiency in distributed energy systems. FOGNITE combines three core components: federated learning, reinforcement learning, and digital twin validation. Each fog node trains a local CNN LSTM model on private energy consumption data, enabling predictive intelligence while preserving data privacy through federated aggregation. A reinforcement learning agent dynamically schedules tasks based on current system load and energy conditions, optimizing for performance under uncertainty. To prevent unsafe or inefficient decisions, a hierarchical digital twin layer simulates potential actions before deployment, significantly reducing execution errors and energy waste. We evaluate FOGNITE on a real world testbed of Raspberry Pi devices, showing up to a 93.7% improvement in load balancing accuracy and a 63.2% reduction in energy waste compared to conventional architectures. By shifting smart grid control from reactive correction to proactive optimization, FOGNITE represents a step toward more intelligent, adaptive, and sustainable energy infrastructures</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Ladder Climbing with a Quadrupedal Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17731v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quadruped robots are proliferating in industrial environments where they carry sensor payloads and serve as autonomous inspection platforms. Despite the advantages of legged robots over their wheeled counterparts on rough and uneven terrain, they are still unable to reliably negotiate a ubiquitous feature of industrial infrastructure: ladders. Inability to traverse ladders prevents quadrupeds from inspecting dangerous locations, puts humans in harm's way, and reduces industrial site productivity. In this paper, we learn quadrupedal ladder climbing via a reinforcement learning-based control policy and a complementary hooked end effector. We evaluate the robustness in simulation across different ladder inclinations, rung geometries, and inter-rung spacings. On hardware, we demonstrate zero-shot transfer with an overall 90% success rate at ladder angles ranging from 70{\deg} to 90{\deg}, consistent climbing performance during unmodeled perturbations, and climbing speeds 232x faster than the state of the art. This work expands the scope of industrial quadruped robot applications beyond inspection on nominal terrains to challenging infrastructural features in the environment, highlighting synergies between robot morphology and control policy when performing complex skills.

The two controllers fundamentally differ from each other as the first is formulated in task acceleration space and the latter is in task force space with passivity considerations. Even though both control methods predict stability under ideal conditions in closed-loop dynamics, their robustness against joint friction, sensor noise, unmodeled external disturbances, and non-perfect contact conditions is not evident. Therefore, we analyze and experimentally compare the two controllers on a humanoid robot platform through swing foot position and orientation control, squatting with and without unmodeled additional weights, and jumping. We also relate the observed performance and characteristic differences with the controller formulations and highlight each controller's advantages and disadvantages.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025). - Link to video: https://youtu.be/Nfm50ycz-FU</p></details> |

In particular, we guide the imitation learning procedures by transferring motions from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities while ensuring the physical feasibility of the target system. In the first stage, we focus on motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. Following this, we refine the motion at the dynamic level by adjusting it in the temporal domain while adhering to physical constraints. This process facilitates policy training via reinforcement learning, enabling precise and robust motion tracking. We demonstrate that our approach successfully transforms noisy motion sources, such as hand-held camera videos, into robot-specific motions that align with the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. Moreover, we demonstrate terrain-aware motion retargeting to perform BackFlip on top of a box. We successfully deployed these skills to four robots with different dimensions and physical properties in the real world through hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 12 figures, videos available at https://taerimyoon.me/Spatio-Temporal-Motion-Retargeting-for-Quadruped-Robots/</p></details> |
| **[A Novel Monte-Carlo Compressed Sensing and Dictionary Learning Method for the Efficient Path Planning of Remote Sensing Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18462v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Compressed Sensing (CS) has gained significant interest as a technique for acquiring high-resolution sensory data using fewer measurements than traditional Nyquist sampling requires. At the same time, autonomous robotic platforms such as drones and rovers have become increasingly popular tools for remote sensing and environmental monitoring tasks, including measurements of temperature, humidity, and air quality. Within this context, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first investigation into how the structure of CS measurement matrices can be exploited to design optimized sampling trajectories for robotic environmental data collection. We propose a novel Monte Carlo optimization framework that generates measurement matrices designed to minimize both the robot's traversal path length and the signal reconstruction error within the CS framework. Central to our approach is the application of Dictionary Learning (DL) to obtain a data-driven sparsifying transform, which enhances reconstruction accuracy while further reducing the number of samples that the robot needs to collect. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments reconstructing $NO_2$ pollution maps over the Gulf region. The results indicate that our approach can reduce robot travel distance to less than $10\%$ of a full-coverage path, while improving reconstruction accuracy by over a factor of five compared to traditional CS methods based on DCT and polynomial dictionaries, as well as by a factor of two compared to previously-proposed Informative Path Planning (IPP) methods.</p></details> |  |

Ensuring their program correctness is fundamental to their successful deployment. However, a general and in-depth understanding of EAIR system bugs remains lacking, which hinders the development of practices and techniques to tackle EAIR system bugs. To bridge this gap, we conducted the first systematic study of 885 EAIR system bugs collected from 80 EAIR system projects to investigate their symptoms, underlying causes, and module distribution. Our analysis takes considerable effort, which classifies these bugs into 18 underlying causes, 15 distinct symptoms, and identifies 13 affected modules. It reveals several new interesting findings and implications which help shed light on future research on tackling or repairing EAIR system bugs. First, among the 15 identified symptoms, our findings highlight 8 symptoms specific to EAIR systems, which is characterized by severe functional failures and potential physical hazards. Second, within the 18 underlying causes, we define 8 EAIR-specific causes, the majority of which stem from the intricate issues of AI- agent reasoning and decision making. Finally, to facilitate precise and efficient bug prediction, detection, and repair, we constructed a mapping between underlying causes and the modules in which they most frequently occur, which enables researchers to focus diagnostic efforts on the modules most susceptible to specific bug types.</p></details> |  |

The synergistic reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction. Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning, (3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically, the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability and generalization.

This conventional process is labor-intensive, inaccessible to non-experts, and inflexible to changes in mission requirements. Here, we propose LAN2CB (Language to Collective Behavior), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to streamline and generalize the multi-robot coordination pipeline. LAN2CB transforms natural language (NL) mission descriptions into executable Python code for multi-robot systems through two core modules: (1) Mission Analysis, which parses mission descriptions into behavior trees, and (2) Code Generation, which leverages the behavior tree and a structured knowledge base to generate robot control code. We further introduce a dataset of natural language mission descriptions to support development and benchmarking. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that LAN2CB enables robust and flexible multi-robot coordination from natural language, significantly reducing manual engineering effort and supporting broad generalization across diverse mission types.

In such practical situations, relying only on inertial sensors will result in navigation solution drift due to the sensors' inherent noise and error terms. One of the emerging solutions to mitigate drift is to maneuver the robot in a snake-like slithering motion to increase the inertial signal-to-noise ratio, allowing the regression of the mobile robot position. In this work, we propose MoRPI-PINN as a physics-informed neural network framework for accurate inertial-based mobile robot navigation. By embedding physical laws and constraints into the training process, MoRPI-PINN is capable of providing an accurate and robust navigation solution. Using real-world experiments, we show accuracy improvements of over 85% compared to other approaches. MoRPI-PINN is a lightweight approach that can be implemented even on edge devices and used in any typical mobile robot application.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

In this paper, we present a lightweight deep learning-based hand gesture recognition system that enables humans to control collaborative robots naturally and efficiently. This model recognizes eight distinct hand gestures with only 1,103 parameters and a compact size of 22 KB, achieving an accuracy of 93.5%. To further optimize the model for real-world deployment on edge devices, we applied quantization and pruning using TensorFlow Lite, reducing the final model size to just 7 KB. The system was successfully implemented and tested on a Universal Robot UR5 collaborative robot within a real-time robotic framework based on ROS2. The results demonstrate that even extremely lightweight models can deliver accurate and responsive hand gesture-based control for collaborative robots, opening new possibilities for natural human-robot interaction in constrained environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modular Robot and Landmark Localisation Using Relative Bearing Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18070v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we propose a modular nonlinear least squares filtering approach for systems composed of independent subsystems. The state and error covariance estimate of each subsystem is updated independently, even when a relative measurement simultaneously depends on the states of multiple subsystems. We integrate the Covariance Intersection (CI) algorithm as part of our solution in order to prevent double counting of information when subsystems share estimates with each other. An alternative derivation of the CI algorithm based on least squares estimation makes this integration possible. We particularise the proposed approach to the robot-landmark localization problem. In this problem, noisy measurements of the bearing angle to a stationary landmark position measured relative to the SE(2) pose of a moving robot couple the estimation problems for the robot pose and the landmark position. In a randomized simulation study, we benchmark the proposed modular method against a monolithic joint state filter to elucidate their respective trade-offs.

In contrast, classical machine learning (ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged, allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities. In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adopt to design and verify FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Presentation at IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC) 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Step-by-step Guide on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Safe Mobile Robot Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17856v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that enables a mobile robot to safely navigate through an obstacle-filled environment is a complicated yet essential task in robotics. In this technical report, safety refers to ensuring that the robot respects state and input constraints while avoiding collisions with obstacles despite the presence of disturbances and measurement noise. This report offers a step-by-step approach to implementing Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) schemes addressing these safety requirements. Numerous books and survey papers provide comprehensive overviews of linear MPC (LMPC) \cite{bemporad2007robust,kouvaritakis2016model}, NMPC \cite{rawlings2017model,allgower2004nonlinear,mayne2014model,grune2017nonlinear,saltik2018outlook}, and their applications in various domains, including robotics \cite{nascimento2018nonholonomic,nguyen2021model,shi2021advanced,wei2022mpc}. This report does not aim to replicate those exhaustive reviews. Instead, it focuses specifically on NMPC as a foundation for safe mobile robot navigation. The goal is to provide a practical and accessible path from theoretical concepts to mathematical proofs and implementation, emphasizing safety and performance guarantees. It is intended for researchers, robotics engineers, and practitioners seeking to bridge the gap between theoretical NMPC formulations and real-world robotic applications.

| **[Robot Operation of Home Appliances by Reading User Manuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20424v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operating home appliances, among the most common tools in every household, is a critical capability for assistive home robots. This paper presents ApBot, a robot system that operates novel household appliances by "reading" their user manuals. ApBot faces multiple challenges: (i) infer goal-conditioned partial policies from their unstructured, textual descriptions in a user manual document, (ii) ground the policies to the appliance in the physical world, and (iii) execute the policies reliably over potentially many steps, despite compounding errors. To tackle these challenges, ApBot constructs a structured, symbolic model of an appliance from its manual, with the help of a large vision-language model (VLM). It grounds the symbolic actions visually to control panel elements. Finally, ApBot closes the loop by updating the model based on visual feedback. Our experiments show that across a wide range of simulated and real-world appliances, ApBot achieves consistent and statistically significant improvements in task success rate, compared with state-of-the-art large VLMs used directly as control policies. These results suggest that a structured internal representations plays an important role in robust robot operation of home appliances, especially, complex ones.</p></details> |  |

Robot learning, however, has thus far failed to replicate this success and remains constrained by a scarcity of available data. Learning from videos (LfV) methods aim to address this data bottleneck by augmenting traditional robot data with large-scale internet video. This video data provides foundational information regarding physical dynamics, behaviours, and tasks, and can be highly informative for general-purpose robots. This survey systematically examines the emerging field of LfV. We first outline essential concepts, including detailing fundamental LfV challenges such as distribution shift and missing action labels in video data. Next, we comprehensively review current methods for extracting knowledge from large-scale internet video, overcoming LfV challenges, and improving robot learning through video-informed training. The survey concludes with a critical discussion of future opportunities. Here, we emphasize the need for scalable foundation model approaches that can leverage the full range of available internet video and enhance the learning of robot policies and dynamics models. Overall, the survey aims to inform and catalyse future LfV research, driving progress towards general-purpose robots.</p></details> |  |

Robotic systems can improve and enrich the physical feedback provided to patients after neurological injury, but they under-utilize the adaptability and clinical expertise of trained therapists. In this position paper, we advocate for a novel approach that integrates the therapist's clinical expertise and nuanced decision-making with the strength, accuracy, and repeatability of robotics: Robot-mediated physical Human-Human Interaction. This framework, which enables two individuals to physically interact through robotic devices, has been studied across diverse research groups and has recently emerged as a promising link between conventional manual therapy and rehabilitation robotics, harmonizing the strengths of both approaches. This paper presents the rationale of a multidisciplinary team-including engineers, doctors, and physical therapists-for conducting research that utilizes: a unified taxonomy to describe robot-mediated rehabilitation, a framework of interaction based on social psychology, and a technological approach that makes robotic systems seamless facilitators of natural human-human interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Design and Control Methods for Using Collaborative Robots in Upper-Limb Rehabilitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18661v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the development of a robotic rehabilitation system for the upper limbs based on collaborative end-effector solutions. The use of commercial collaborative robots offers significant advantages for this task, as they are optimized from an engineering perspective and ensure safe physical interaction with humans. However, they also come with noticeable drawbacks, such as the limited range of sizes available on the market and the standard control modes, which are primarily oriented towards industrial or service applications. To address these limitations, we propose an optimization-based design method to fully exploit the capability of the cobot in performing rehabilitation tasks. Additionally, we introduce a novel control architecture based on an admittance-type Virtual Fixture method, which constrains the motion of the robot along a prescribed path. This approach allows for an intuitive definition of the task to be performed via Programming by Demonstration and enables the system to operate both passively and actively. In passive mode, the system supports the patient during task execution with additional force, while in active mode, it opposes the motion with a braking force. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[ERMV: Editing 4D Robotic Multi-view images to enhance embodied agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17462v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot imitation learning relies on 4D multi-view sequential images. However, the high cost of data collection and the scarcity of high-quality data severely constrain the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Data augmentation is a powerful strategy to overcome data scarcity, but methods for editing 4D multi-view sequential images for manipulation tasks are currently lacking. Thus, we propose ERMV (Editing Robotic Multi-View 4D data), a novel data augmentation framework that efficiently edits an entire multi-view sequence based on single-frame editing and robot state conditions. This task presents three core challenges: (1) maintaining geometric and appearance consistency across dynamic views and long time horizons; (2) expanding the working window with low computational costs; and (3) ensuring the semantic integrity of critical objects like the robot arm. ERMV addresses these challenges through a series of innovations. First, to ensure spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, we introduce a novel Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism that learns pixel shift caused by movement before applying geometric constraints. Second, to maximize the editing working window, ERMV pioneers a Sparse Spatio-Temporal (STT) module, which decouples the temporal and spatial views and remodels a single-frame multi-view problem through sparse sampling of the views to reduce computational demands. Third, to alleviate error accumulation, we incorporate a feedback intervention Mechanism, which uses a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request targeted expert guidance only when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERMV-augmented data significantly boosts the robustness and generalization of VLA models in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Exploratory Study on Human-Robot Interaction using Semantics-based Situational Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17376v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the impact of high-level semantics (evaluation of the environment) on Human-Robot Teams (HRT) and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) in the context of mobile robot deployments. Although semantics has been widely researched in AI, how high-level semantics can benefit the HRT paradigm is underexplored, often fuzzy, and intractable. We applied a semantics-based framework that could reveal different indicators of the environment (i.e. how much semantic information exists) in a mock-up disaster response mission. In such missions, semantics are crucial as the HRT should handle complex situations and respond quickly with correct decisions, where humans might have a high workload and stress. Especially when human operators need to shift their attention between robots and other tasks, they will struggle to build Situational Awareness (SA) quickly. The experiment suggests that the presented semantics: 1) alleviate the perceived workload of human operators; 2) increase the operator's trust in the SA; and 3) help to reduce the reaction time in switching the level of autonomy when needed. Additionally, we find that participants with higher trust in the system are encouraged by high-level semantics to use teleoperation mode more.</p></details> |  |

For this edge training, Microscaling (MX) data types offer a promising solution by combining integer and floating-point representations with shared exponents, reducing energy consumption while maintaining accuracy. However, the state-of-the-art continuous learning processor, namely Dacapo, faces limitations with its MXINT-only support and inefficient vector-based grouping during backpropagation. In this paper, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first work that addresses these limitations with two key innovations: (1) a precision-scalable arithmetic unit that supports all six MX data types by exploiting sub-word parallelism and unified integer and floating-point processing; and (2) support for square shared exponent groups to enable efficient weight handling during backpropagation, removing storage redundancy and quantization overhead. We evaluate our design against Dacapo under iso-peak-throughput on four robotics workloads in TSMC 16nm FinFET technology at 400MHz, reaching a 51% lower memory footprint, and 4x higher effective training throughput, while achieving comparable energy efficiency, enabling efficient robotics continual learning at the edge.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in 2025 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design (ISLPED 2025)</p></details> |

While recent progress in natural language processing and large multimodal models has enhanced robots' ability to understand complex instructions, robot manipulation still faces the procedural skill dilemma and the declarative skill dilemma in open environments. Existing methods often compromise cognitive and executive capabilities. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose RoBridge, a hierarchical intelligent architecture for general robotic manipulation. It consists of a high-level cognitive planner (HCP) based on a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), an invariant operable representation (IOR) serving as a symbolic bridge, and a generalist embodied agent (GEA). RoBridge maintains the declarative skill of VLM and unleashes the procedural skill of reinforcement learning, effectively bridging the gap between cognition and execution. RoBridge demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing baselines, achieving a 75% success rate on new tasks and an 83% average success rate in sim-to-real generalization using only five real-world data samples per task. This work represents a significant step towards integrating cognitive reasoning with physical execution in robotic systems, offering a new paradigm for general robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://abliao.github.io/RoBridge/</p></details> |
| **[ICCO: Learning an Instruction-conditioned Coordinator for Language-guided Task-aligned Multi-robot Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12122v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have permitted the development of language-guided multi-robot systems, which allow robots to execute tasks based on natural language instructions. However, achieving effective coordination in distributed multi-agent environments remains challenging due to (1) misalignment between instructions and task requirements and (2) inconsistency in robot behaviors when they independently interpret ambiguous instructions. To address these challenges, we propose Instruction-Conditioned Coordinator (ICCO), a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework designed to enhance coordination in language-guided multi-robot systems. ICCO consists of a Coordinator agent and multiple Local Agents, where the Coordinator generates Task-Aligned and Consistent Instructions (TACI) by integrating language instructions with environmental states, ensuring task alignment and behavioral consistency. The Coordinator and Local Agents are jointly trained to optimize a reward function that balances task efficiency and instruction following. A Consistency Enhancement Term is added to the learning objective to maximize mutual information between instructions and robot behaviors, further improving coordination. Simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of ICCO in achieving language-guided task-aligned multi-robot control. The demonstration can be found at https://yanoyoshiki.github.io/ICCO/.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, to be published in the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems</p></details> |
| **[Reconfigurable Tendon-Driven Robots: Eliminating Inter-segmental Coupling via Independently Lockable Joints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17163v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With a slender redundant body, the tendon-driven robot (TDR) has a large workspace and great maneuverability while working in complex environments. TDR comprises multiple independently controlled robot segments, each with a set of driving tendons. While increasing the number of robot segments enhances dexterity and expands the workspace, this structural expansion also introduces intensified inter-segmental coupling. Therefore, achieving precise TDR control requires more complex models and additional motors. This paper presents a reconfigurable tendon-driven robot (RTR) equipped with innovative lockable joints. Each joint's state (locked/free) can be individually controlled through a pair of antagonistic tendons, and its structure eliminates the need for a continuous power supply to maintain the state. Operators can selectively actuate the targeted robot segments, and this scheme fundamentally eliminates the inter-segmental coupling, thereby avoiding the requirement for complex coordinated control between segments. The workspace of RTR has been simulated and compared with traditional TDRs' workspace, and RTR's advantages are further revealed. The kinematics and statics models of the RTR have been derived and validation experiments have been conducted. Demonstrations have been performed using a seven-joint RTR prototype to show its reconfigurability and moving ability in complex environments with an actuator pack comprising only six motors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Objective Trajectory Planning for a Robotic Arm in Curtain Wall Installation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17140v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of labor shortages and rising costs, construction robots are regarded as the key to revolutionizing traditional construction methods and improving efficiency and quality in the construction industry. In order to ensure that construction robots can perform tasks efficiently and accurately in complex construction environments, traditional single-objective trajectory optimization methods are difficult to meet the complex requirements of the changing construction environment. Therefore, we propose a multi-objective trajectory optimization for the robotic arm used in the curtain wall installation. First, we design a robotic arm for curtain wall installation, integrating serial, parallel, and folding arm elements, while considering its physical properties and motion characteristics. In addition, this paper proposes an NSGA-III-FO algorithm (NSGA-III with Focused Operator, NSGA-III-FO) that incorporates a focus operator screening mechanism to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm towards the Pareto front, thereby effectively balancing the multi-objective constraints of construction robots. The proposed algorithm is tested against NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and MSOPS-II in ten consecutive trials on the DTLZ3 and WFG3 test functions, showing significantly better convergence efficiency than the other algorithms. Finally, we conduct two sets of experiments on the designed robotic arm platform, which confirm the efficiency and practicality of the NSGA-III-FO algorithm in solving multi-objective trajectory planning problems for curtain wall installation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Parameter Identification of a Curtain Wall Installation Robotic Arm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17136v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the construction industry, traditional methods fail to meet the modern demands for efficiency and quality. The curtain wall installation is a critical component of construction projects. We design a hydraulically driven robotic arm for curtain wall installation and a dynamic parameter identification method. We establish a Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) model based on measured robotic arm structural parameters and integrate hydraulic cylinder dynamics to construct a composite parametric system driven by a Stribeck friction model. By designing high-signal-to-noise ratio displacement excitation signals for hydraulic cylinders and combining Fourier series to construct optimal excitation trajectories that satisfy joint constraints, this method effectively excites the characteristics of each parameter in the minimal parameter set of the dynamic model of the robotic arm. On this basis, a hierarchical progressive parameter identification strategy is proposed: least squares estimation is employed to separately identify and jointly calibrate the dynamic parameters of both the hydraulic cylinder and the robotic arm, yielding Stribeck model curves for each joint. Experimental validation on a robotic arm platform demonstrates residual standard deviations below 0.4 Nm between theoretical and measured joint torques, confirming high-precision dynamic parameter identification for the hydraulic-driven curtain wall installation robotic arm. This significantly contributes to enhancing the intelligence level of curtain wall installation operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Modeling and Dimensional Optimization of Legged Mechanisms for Construction Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17132v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of the construction industry, issues such as harsh working environments, high-intensity and high-risk tasks, and labor shortages have become increasingly prominent. This drives higher demands for construction robots in terms of low energy consumption, high mobility, and high load capacity. This paper focuses on the design and optimization of leg structures for construction robots, aiming to improve their dynamic performance, reduce energy consumption, and enhance load-bearing capabilities. Firstly, based on the leg configuration of ants in nature, we design a structure for the robot's leg. Secondly, we propose a novel structural optimization method. Using the Lagrangian approach, a dynamic model of the leg was established. Combining the dynamic model with the leg's motion trajectory, we formulated multiple dynamic evaluation metrics and conducted a comprehensive optimization study on the geometric parameters of each leg segment. The results show that the optimized leg structure reduces peak joint torques and energy consumption by over 20%. Finally, dynamic simulation experiments were conducted using ADAMS. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in the driving power of each joint after optimization, validating the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed strategy. This study provides a theoretical foundation and technical support for the design of heavy-load, high-performance construction robots.</p></details> |  |

The method extracts the 2D ellipse center from the image and the 3D sphere center from the pointcloud, which are then paired to compute the transformation matrix. Specifically, the image is first decomposed using the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Then, a novel algorithm extracts an ellipse from a potentially corrupted sphere, and the extracted center of ellipse is corrected for errors caused by the perspective projection model. For the LiDAR pointcloud, points on the sphere tend to be highly noisy due to the absence of flat regions. To accurately extract the sphere from these noisy measurements, we apply a hierarchical weighted sum to the accumulated pointcloud. Through experiments, we demonstrated that the sphere can be robustly detected even under both types of corruption, outperforming other targets. We evaluated our method using three different types of LiDARs (spinning, solid-state, and non-repetitive) with cameras positioned in three different locations. Furthermore, we validated the robustness of our method to target corruption by experimenting with spheres subjected to various types of degradation. These experiments were conducted in both a planetary test and a field environment. Our code is available at https://github.com/sparolab/MARSCalib.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

Recently, significant progress has been made to advance this field. These kinds of models are typically evaluated through task success rates, which fail to capture the quality of task execution and the mode's confidence in its decisions. In this paper, we propose eight uncertainty metrics and five quality metrics specifically designed for VLA models for robotic manipulation tasks. We assess their effectiveness through a large-scale empirical study involving 908 successful task executions from three state-of-the-art VLA models across four representative robotic manipulation tasks. Human domain experts manually labeled task quality, allowing us to analyze the correlation between our proposed metrics and expert judgments. The results reveal that several metrics show moderate to strong correlation with human assessments, highlighting their utility for evaluating task quality and model confidence. Furthermore, we found that some of the metrics can discriminate between high-, medium-, and low-quality executions from unsuccessful tasks, which can be interesting when test oracles are not available. Our findings challenge the adequacy of current evaluation practices that rely solely on binary success rates and pave the way for improved real-time monitoring and adaptive enhancement of VLA-enabled robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

However, current systems often separate map exploration and path planning, with exploration relying on inefficient algorithms due to limited (partially observed) environmental information. In this paper, we present a novel navigation pipeline named "VL-Explore" for simultaneous exploration and target discovery in unknown environments, leveraging the capabilities of a vision-language model named CLIP. Our approach requires only monocular vision and operates without any prior map or knowledge about the target. For comprehensive evaluations, we designed a functional prototype of a UGV (unmanned ground vehicle) system named "Open Rover", a customized platform for general-purpose VLN tasks. We integrated and deployed the VL-Explore pipeline on Open Rover to evaluate its throughput, obstacle avoidance capability, and trajectory performance across various real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that VL-Explore consistently outperforms traditional map-traversal algorithms and achieves performance comparable to path-planning methods that depend on prior map and target knowledge. Notably, VL-Explore offers real-time active navigation without requiring pre-captured candidate images or pre-built node graphs, addressing key limitations of existing VLN pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>V2, i...</summary><p>V2, includes suppl as appendix</p></details> |

This research introduces RAPTAR (Radiation Pattern Acquisition through Robotic Automation), a portable, state-of-the-art, and autonomous system based on collaborative robotics. RAPTAR enables 3D radiation-pattern measurement of integrated radar modules without dedicated anechoic facilities. The system is designed to address the challenges of testing radar modules mounted in diverse real-world configurations, including vehicles, UAVs, AR/VR headsets, and biomedical devices, where traditional measurement setups are impractical. A 7-degree-of-freedom Franka cobot holds the receiver probe and performs collision-free manipulation across a hemispherical spatial domain, guided by real-time motion planning and calibration accuracy with RMS error below 0.9 mm. The system achieves an angular resolution upto 2.5 degree and integrates seamlessly with RF instrumentation for near- and far-field power measurements. Experimental scans of a 60 GHz radar module show a mean absolute error of less than 2 dB compared to full-wave electromagnetic simulations ground truth. Benchmarking against baseline method demonstrates 36.5% lower mean absolute error, highlighting RAPTAR accuracy and repeatability.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages, IEEE Journal</p></details> |

Using software-in-the-loop (SIL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL), an RL-trained artificial intelligence (AI) controller is developed using a digital twin (DT) in simulation and subsequently verified in physical experiments. An underwater motion capture (MOCAP) system provides real-time 3D position and orientation feedback during verification testing for precise synchronization between the digital and physical domains. A key novelty of this approach is the combined use of a general-purpose game engine for simulation, deep RL, and real-time underwater motion capture for an effective zero-shot sim-to-real strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Automate This? Exploring Correlations between Desire for Robotic Automation, Invested Time and Well-Being](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06348v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the motivations underlying the human inclination to automate tasks is vital to developing truly helpful robots integrated into daily life. Accordingly, we ask: are individuals more inclined to automate chores based on the time they consume or the feelings experienced while performing them? This study explores these preferences and whether they vary across different social groups (i.e., gender category and income level). Leveraging data from the BEHAVIOR-1K dataset, the American Time-Use Survey, and the American Time-Use Survey Well-Being Module, we investigate the relationship between the desire for automation, time spent on daily activities, and their associated feelings - Happiness, Meaningfulness, Sadness, Painfulness, Stressfulness, or Tiredness. Our key findings show that, despite common assumptions, time spent does not strongly relate to the desire for automation for the general population. For the feelings analyzed, only happiness and pain are key indicators. Significant differences by gender and economic level also emerged: Women prefer to automate stressful activities, whereas men prefer to automate those that make them unhappy; mid-income individuals prioritize automating less enjoyable and meaningful activities, while low and high-income show no significant correlations. We hope our research helps motivate technologies to develop robots that match the priorities of potential users, moving domestic robotics toward more socially relevant solutions. We open-source all the data, including an online tool that enables the community to replicate our analysis and explore additional trends at https://robin-lab.cs.utexas.edu/why-automate-this/.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

However, grounding VLMs, originally trained on internet data, to diverse real-world robots remains a challenge. This paper presents ExpTeach, a framework that grounds VLMs to physical robots by building a self-generated memory of real-world experiences. In ExpTeach, the VLM autonomously plans actions, verifies outcomes, reflects on failures, and adapts robot behaviors in a closed loop. The self-generated experiences during this process are then summarized into a long-term memory, enabling retrieval of learned knowledge to guide future tasks via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Additionally, ExpTeach enhances the spatial understanding of VLMs with an on-demand image annotation module. In experiments, we show that reflection improves success rates from 36% to 84% on four challenging robotic tasks and observe the emergence of intelligent object interactions, including creative tool use. Across extensive tests on 12 real-world scenarios (including eight unseen ones), we find that grounding with long-term memory boosts single-trial success rates from 22% to 80%, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of ExpTeach.</p></details> |  |

Despite the advantages of legged robots over their wheeled counterparts on rough and uneven terrain, they are still unable to reliably negotiate a ubiquitous feature of industrial infrastructure: ladders. Inability to traverse ladders prevents quadrupeds from inspecting dangerous locations, puts humans in harm's way, and reduces industrial site productivity. In this paper, we learn quadrupedal ladder climbing via a reinforcement learning-based control policy and a complementary hooked end effector. We evaluate the robustness in simulation across different ladder inclinations, rung geometries, and inter-rung spacings. On hardware, we demonstrate zero-shot transfer with an overall 90% success rate at ladder angles ranging from 70{\deg} to 90{\deg}, consistent climbing performance during unmodeled perturbations, and climbing speeds 232x faster than the state of the art.

| **[Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Models-based Anomaly Detection for under-constrained Cable-Driven Parallel Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07714v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) are increasingly used for load manipulation tasks involving predefined toolpaths with intermediate stops. At each stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the cables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by detecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or cable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using only motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive, unsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a brief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on known anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using Mahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds triggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the latest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions. Validation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind intensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4% average true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative evaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates higher robustness to drift and environmental variation.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Guided Reinforcement Learning for Omnidirectional 3D Jumping in Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16481v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jumping poses a significant challenge for quadruped robots, despite being crucial for many operational scenarios. While optimisation methods exist for controlling such motions, they are often time-consuming and demand extensive knowledge of robot and terrain parameters, making them less robust in real-world scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable alternative, yet conventional end-to-end approaches lack efficiency in terms of sample complexity, requiring extensive training in simulations, and predictability of the final motion, which makes it difficult to certify the safety of the final motion. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel guided reinforcement learning approach that leverages physical intuition for efficient and explainable jumping, by combining B\'ezier curves with a Uniformly Accelerated Rectilinear Motion (UARM) model. Extensive simulation and experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our approach over existing alternatives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Designing for Difference: How Human Characteristics Shape Perceptions of Collaborative Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16480v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of assistive robots for social collaboration raises critical questions about responsible and inclusive design, especially when interacting with individuals from protected groups such as those with disabilities or advanced age. Currently, research is scarce on how participants assess varying robot behaviors in combination with diverse human needs, likely since participants have limited real-world experience with advanced domestic robots. In the current study, we aim to address this gap while using methods that enable participants to assess robot behavior, as well as methods that support meaningful reflection despite limited experience. In an online study, 112 participants (from both experimental and control groups) evaluated 7 videos from a total of 28 variations of human-robot collaboration types. The experimental group first completed a cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise on human-robot collaboration before providing their ratings. Although CAM reflection did not significantly affect overall ratings, it led to more pronounced assessments for certain combinations of robot behavior and human condition. Most importantly, the type of human-robot collaboration influences the assessment. Antisocial robot behavior was consistently rated as the lowest, while collaboration with aged individuals elicited more sensitive evaluations. Scenarios involving object handovers were viewed more positively than those without them. These findings suggest that both human characteristics and interaction paradigms influence the perceived acceptability of collaborative robots, underscoring the importance of prosocial design. They also highlight the potential of reflective methods, such as CAM, to elicit nuanced feedback, supporting the development of user-centered and socially responsible robotic systems tailored to diverse populations.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI or Human? Understanding Perceptions of Embodied Robots with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16398v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of artificial intelligence has long been associated to the the challenge of effectively measuring intelligence. Even if the Turing Test was introduced as a means of assessing a system intelligence, its relevance and application within the field of human-robot interaction remain largely underexplored. This study investigates the perception of intelligence in embodied robots by performing a Turing Test within a robotic platform. A total of 34 participants were tasked with distinguishing between AI- and human-operated robots while engaging in two interactive tasks: an information retrieval and a package handover. These tasks assessed the robot perception and navigation abilities under both static and dynamic conditions. Results indicate that participants were unable to reliably differentiate between AI- and human-controlled robots beyond chance levels. Furthermore, analysis of participant responses reveals key factors influencing the perception of artificial versus human intelligence in embodied robotic systems. These findings provide insights into the design of future interactive robots and contribute to the ongoing discourse on intelligence assessment in AI-driven systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Humanoid Robot Whole-body Geometric Calibration with Embedded Sensors and a Single Plane](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16369v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-body geometric calibration of humanoid robots using classical robot calibration methods is a timeconsuming and experimentally burdensome task. However, despite its significance for accurate control and simulation, it is often overlooked in the humanoid robotics community. To address this issue, we propose a novel practical method that utilizes a single plane, embedded force sensors, and an admittance controller to calibrate the whole-body kinematics of humanoids without requiring manual intervention. Given the complexity of humanoid robots, it is crucial to generate and determine a minimal set of optimal calibration postures. To do so, we propose a new algorithm called IROC (Information Ranking algorithm for selecting Optimal Calibration postures). IROC requires a pool of feasible candidate postures to build a normalized weighted information matrix for each posture. Then, contrary to other algorithms from the literature, IROC will determine the minimal number of optimal postures that are to be played onto a robot for its calibration. Both IROC and the single-plane calibration method were experimentally validated on a TALOS humanoid robot. The total whole-body kinematics chain was calibrated using solely 31 optimal postures with 3-point contacts on a table by the robot gripper. In a cross-validation experiment, the average root-mean-square (RMS) error was reduced by a factor of 2.3 compared to the manufacturer's model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology Optimization of Leg Structures for Construction Robots Based on Variable Density Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16335v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex terrain construction environments, there are high demands for robots to achieve both high payload capacity and mobility flexibility. As the key load-bearing component, the optimization of robotic leg structures is of particular importance. Therefore, this study focuses on the optimization of leg structures for construction robots, proposing a topology optimization strategy based on the SIMP (Solid Isotropic Microstructures with Penalization) variable density method along with a structural re-design approach. The design performance is comprehensively validated through finite element analysis using ANSYS. First, static and modal analyses are conducted to evaluate the rationality of the initial design. Then, topology optimization using the SIMP-based variable density method is applied to the femur section, which accounts for the largest proportion of the leg's weight. Based on iterative calculations, the femur undergoes secondary structural reconstruction. After optimization, the mass of the femur is reduced by 19.45\%, and the overall leg mass decreases by 7.92\%, achieving the goal of lightweight design. Finally, static and modal analyses are conducted on the reconstructed leg. The results demonstrate that the optimized leg still meets structural performance requirements, validating the feasibility of lightweight design. This research provides robust theoretical and technical support for lightweight construction robot design and lays a foundation for their efficient operation in complex construction environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design and Dimensional Optimization of Legged Structures for Construction Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16328v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Faced with complex and unstructured construction environments, wheeled and tracked robots exhibit significant limitations in terrain adaptability and flexibility, making it difficult to meet the requirements of autonomous operation. Inspired by ants in nature, this paper proposes a leg configuration design and optimization method tailored for construction scenarios, aiming to enhance the autonomous mobility of construction robots. This paper analyzes the full operational motion performance of the leg during both swing and stance phases. First, based on kinematic modeling and multi-dimensional workspace analysis, the concept of an "improved workspace" is introduced, and graphical methods are used to optimize the leg dimensions during the swing phase. Furthermore, a new concept of "average manipulability" is introduced based on the velocity Jacobian matrix, and numerical solutions are applied to obtain the leg segment ratio that maximizes manipulability. To overcome the difficulties associated with traditional analytical methods, virtual prototype simulations are conducted in ADAMS to explore the relationship between the robot body's optimal flexibility and leg segment proportions. In summary, the leg segment proportions with the best comprehensive motion performance are obtained. This study presents the first multi-dimensional quantitative evaluation framework for leg motion performance tailored for construction environments, providing a structural design foundation for legged construction robots to achieve autonomous mobility in complex terrains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning of a Curtain Wall Installation Robot Based on Biomimetic Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16305v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the robotics market rapidly evolves, energy consumption has become a critical issue, particularly restricting the application of construction robots. To tackle this challenge, our study innovatively draws inspiration from the mechanics of human upper limb movements during weight lifting, proposing a bio-inspired trajectory planning framework that incorporates human energy conversion principles. By collecting motion trajectories and electromyography (EMG) signals during dumbbell curls, we construct an anthropomorphic trajectory planning that integrates human force exertion patterns and energy consumption patterns. Utilizing the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, we achieve dynamic load distribution for robotic arm trajectory planning based on human-like movement features. In practical application, these bio-inspired movement characteristics are applied to curtain wall installation tasks, validating the correctness and superiority of our trajectory planning method. Simulation results demonstrate a 48.4% reduction in energy consumption through intelligent conversion between kinetic and potential energy. This approach provides new insights and theoretical support for optimizing energy use in curtain wall installation robots during actual handling tasks.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, we propose a robust pose initialization method for fast locomotion and IMU error in legged robots, integrating IMU/Legged odometry, inter-frame Perspective-n-Point (PnP), and Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP). Furthermore, a novel optimization framework that tightly couples depth-to-map and GICP geometric constraints is first introduced to improve the robustness and accuracy in long-duration, visually texture-less environments. The proposed algorithms achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on collected legged robots and open-source datasets. To further promote research and development, the open-source datasets and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/HorizonRobotics/GeoFlowSlam</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[SciFi-Benchmark: Leveraging Science Fiction To Improve Robot Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10706v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the recent rate of progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, a tantalizing question is emerging: would robots controlled by emerging AI systems be strongly aligned with human values? In this work, we propose a scalable way to probe this question by generating a benchmark spanning the key moments in 824 major pieces of science fiction literature (movies, tv, novels and scientific books) where an agent (AI or robot) made critical decisions (good or bad). We use a state-of-the-art LLM's recollection of each key moment to generate questions in similar situations, the decisions made by the agent, and alternative decisions it could have made (good or bad). We then measure an approximation of how well models align with human values on a set of human-voted answers. We also generate rules that can be automatically improved via an amendment process in order to generate the first Sci-Fi inspired constitutions for promoting ethical behavior in AIs and robots in the real world. Our first finding is that modern LLMs paired with constitutions turn out to be well-aligned with human values (95.8%), contrary to unsettling decisions typically made in Sci-Fi (only 21.2% alignment). Secondly, we find that generated constitutions substantially increase alignment compared to the base model (79.4% to 95.8%), and show resilience to an adversarial prompt setting (23.3% to 92.3%). Additionally, we find that those constitutions are among the top performers on the ASIMOV Benchmark which is derived from real-world images and hospital injury reports. Sci-Fi-inspired constitutions are thus highly aligned and applicable in real-world situations. We release SciFi-Benchmark: a large-scale dataset to advance robot ethics and safety research. It comprises 9,056 questions and 53,384 answers generated through a novel LLM-introspection process, in addition to a smaller human-labeled evaluation set.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor improvements over previous version</p></details> |

We study the problem of adapting on-the-fly to such novel scenarios during deployment, by drawing upon a diverse repertoire of previouslylearned behaviors. Our approach, RObust Autonomous Modulation (ROAM), introduces a mechanism based on the perceived value of pre-trained behaviors to select and adapt pre-trained behaviors to the situation at hand. Crucially, this adaptation process all happens within a single episode at test time, without any human supervision. We demonstrate that ROAM enables a robot to adapt rapidly to changes in dynamics both in simulation and on a real Go1 quadruped, even successfully moving forward with roller skates on its feet. Our approach adapts over 2x as efficiently compared to existing methods when facing a variety of out-of-distribution situations during deployment by effectively choosing and adapting relevant behaviors on-the-fly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking LLM Privacy Recognition for Social Robot Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16124v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social robots are embodied agents that interact with people while following human communication norms. These robots interact using verbal and non-verbal cues, and share the physical environments of people. While social robots have previously utilized rule-based systems or probabilistic models for user interaction, the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities to develop LLM-empowered social robots for enhanced human-robot interaction. To fully realize these capabilities, however, robots need to collect data such as audio, fine-grained images, video, and locations. As a result, LLMs often process sensitive personal information, particularly within home environments. Given the tension between utility and privacy risks, evaluating how current LLMs manage sensitive data is critical. Specifically, we aim to explore the extent to which out-of-the-box LLMs are privacy-aware in the context of household social robots. In this study, we present a set of privacy-relevant scenarios crafted through the lens of Contextual Integrity (CI). We first survey users' privacy preferences regarding in-home social robot behaviors and then examine how their privacy orientation affects their choices of these behaviors (N = 450). We then provide the same set of scenarios and questions to state-of-the-art LLMs (N = 10) and find that the agreement between humans and LLMs is low. To further investigate the capabilities of LLMs as a potential privacy controller, we implement four additional prompting strategies and compare their results. Finally, we discuss the implications and potential of AI privacy awareness in human-robot interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Look, Focus, Act: Efficient and Robust Robot Learning via Human Gaze and Foveated Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15833v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is a highly active process driven by gaze, which directs attention and fixation to task-relevant regions and dramatically reduces visual processing. In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive, uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance both efficiency and performance. We build on recent advances in foveated image processing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both human head movement and eye tracking. Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA robot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously collecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as well as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that incorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated patch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation. Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number of tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions of interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction from human data. The first is a two-stage model that predicts gaze to guide foveation and action; the second integrates gaze into the action space, allowing the policy to jointly predict gaze and actions end-to-end. Our results show that our method for foveated robot vision not only drastically reduces computational overhead, but also improves performance for high precision tasks and robustness to unseen distractors. Together, these findings suggest that human-inspired visual processing offers a useful inductive bias for robotic vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

This is true not only for model-based controllers, but also for model-free, real-time control methods such as extremum seeking control (ESC). In this paper, we propose a unicycle-based ESC design applicable to differential wheeled robots that: (1) is very simple design, based on one simple control-affine law, and without state integrators; (2) attenuates oscillations known to persist in ESC designs (i.e., fully stop at the source); and (3) operates in a model-free, real-time setting, tolerating environmental/sensor noise. We provide simulation and real-world robotic experimental results for fixed and moving light source seeking by a differential wheeled robot using our proposed design. Results indicate clear advantages of our proposed design when compared to the literature, including attenuation of undesired oscillations, improved convergence speed, and better handling of noise.</p></details> |  |

Existing HRI systems demonstrate great progress in interpreting and following user instructions, action generation, and robot task solving. On the other hand, bi-directional, multi-modal, and context-aware support of the user in collaborative tasks still remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present a gaze- and speech-informed interface to the assistive robot, which is able to perceive the working environment from multiple vision inputs and support the dynamic user in their tasks. Our system is designed to be modular and transferable to adapt to diverse tasks and robots, and it is capable of real-time use of language-based interaction state representation and fast on board perception modules. Its development was supported by multiple public dissemination events, contributing important considerations for improved robustness and user experience. Furthermore, in two lab studies, we compare the performance and user ratings of our system with those of a traditional scripted HRI pipeline. Our findings indicate that an LLM-based approach enhances adaptability and marginally improves user engagement and task execution metrics but may produce redundant output, while a scripted pipeline is well suited for more straightforward tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the 34th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN), which will be held in Eindhoven, Netherlands on August 25-29, 2025.

As an accessible robot for broad applications across classroom education to AI experiments, Forte pushes forward the performance limitations of existing low-cost educational arms. We introduce a cost-effective mechanical design that combines capstan-based cable drives, timing belts, simple tensioning mechanisms, and lightweight 3D-printed structures, along with topology optimization for structural stiffness. Through careful drivetrain engineering, we minimize backlash and maintain control fidelity without relying on high-power electronics or expensive manufacturing processes. Experimental validation demonstrates that Forte achieves high repeatability and load capacity, offering a compelling robotic platform for both classroom instruction and advanced robotics research.</p></details> |  |

Still, the inherent properties of cables, such as resilience, hysteresis, and friction, often lead to particular difficulties in modeling and control. This paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC) method that relies exclusively on input-output data, without a physical model, to improve the control accuracy of FCRAs. First, we develop an implicit model based on input-output data and integrate it into an MPC optimization framework. Second, a data selection algorithm (DSA) is introduced to filter the data that best characterize the system, thereby reducing the solution time per step to approximately 4 ms, which is an improvement of nearly 80%. Lastly, the influence of hyperparameters on tracking error is investigated through simulation. The proposed method has been validated on a real FCRA platform, including five-point positioning accuracy tests, a five-point response tracking test, and trajectory tracking for letter drawing. The results demonstrate that the average positioning accuracy is approximately 2.070 mm. Moreover, compared to the PID method with an average tracking error of 1.418{\deg}, the proposed method achieves an average tracking error of 0.541{\deg}.</p></details> |  |
| **[EMP: Executable Motion Prior for Humanoid Robot Standing Upper-body Motion Imitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15649v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To support humanoid robots in performing manipulation tasks, it is essential to study stable standing while accommodating upper-body motions. However, the limited controllable range of humanoid robots in a standing position affects the stability of the entire body. Thus we introduce a reinforcement learning based framework for humanoid robots to imitate human upper-body motions while maintaining overall stability. Our approach begins with designing a retargeting network that generates a large-scale upper-body motion dataset for training the reinforcement learning (RL) policy, which enables the humanoid robot to track upper-body motion targets, employing domain randomization for enhanced robustness. To avoid exceeding the robot's execution capability and ensure safety and stability, we propose an Executable Motion Prior (EMP) module, which adjusts the input target movements based on the robot's current state. This adjustment improves standing stability while minimizing changes to motion amplitude. We evaluate our framework through simulation and real-world tests, demonstrating its practical applicability.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional approaches, typically involving bedside interviews and manual documentation, are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing digital solutions, such as web questionnaires and intelligent automated calls, can alleviate the workload of nurses to a certain extent, they either deliver an inflexible scripted interaction or face private information leakage issues. To address these limitations, this paper introduces FollowUpBot, an LLM-powered edge-deployed robot for postoperative care and monitoring. It allows dynamic planning of optimal routes and uses edge-deployed LLMs to conduct adaptive and face-to-face conversations with patients through multiple interaction modes, ensuring data privacy. Moreover, FollowUpBot is capable of automatically generating structured postoperative follow-up reports for healthcare institutions by analyzing patient interactions during follow-up. Experimental results demonstrate that our robot achieves high coverage and satisfaction in follow-up interactions, as well as high report generation accuracy across diverse field types.

Multiple kiwifruit detachment mechanisms were designed and field testing of one of the concepts showed that the mechanism could reliably pick kiwifruit. Furthermore, this kiwifruit detachment mechanism was able to reach over 80 percent of fruit in the cluttered kiwifruit canopy, whereas the previous state of the art mechanism was only able to reach less than 70 percent of the fruit. Artificial pollination was performed by detecting flowers and then spraying pollen in solution onto the detected flowers from a line of sprayers on a boom, while driving at up to 1.4 ms-1. In addition, the height of the canopy was measured and the spray boom was moved up and down to keep the boom close enough to the flowers for the spray to reach the flowers, while minimising collisions with the canopy. Mobile robot navigation was performed using a 2D lidar in apple orchards and vineyards. Lidar navigation in kiwifruit orchards was more challenging because the pergola structure only provides a small amount of data for the direction of rows, compared to the amount of data from the overhead canopy, the undulating ground and other objects in the orchards. Multiple methods are presented here for extracting structure defining features from 3D lidar data in kiwifruit orchards. In addition, a 3D lidar navigation system -- which performed row following, row end detection and row end turns -- was tested for over 30 km of autonomous driving in kiwifruit orchards. Computer vision algorithms for row detection and row following were also tested. The computer vision algorithm worked as well as the 3D lidar row following method in testing.</p></details> |  |

Although advancements in robotic autonomy, human operation remains essential in complex aerial environments. Existing teleoperation approaches for multirotors fail to fully leverage the additional DoFs provided by omnidirectional rotation. Additionally, the dexterity of human fingers should be exploited for more engaged interaction. In this work, we propose an aerial teleoperation system that brings the rotational flexibility of human hands into the unbounded aerial workspace. Our system includes two motion-tracking marker sets--one on the shoulder and one on the hand--along with a data glove to capture hand gestures. Using these inputs, we design four interaction modes for different tasks, including Spherical Mode and Cartesian Mode for long-range moving, Operation Mode for precise manipulation, as well as Locking Mode for temporary pauses, where the hand gestures are utilized for seamless mode switching. We evaluate our system on a vertically mounted valve-turning task in the real world, demonstrating how each mode contributes to effective aerial manipulation. This interaction framework bridges human dexterity with aerial robotics, paving the way for enhanced aerial teleoperation in unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 10 figures.

Prior work has explored self-reflection in Large Language Models (LLMs) for task planning error correction; however, existing methods are constrained by inflexible self-reflection mechanisms that limit their effectiveness. Motivated by these limitations and inspired by human cognitive adaptation, we propose the Flexible Constructivism Reflection Framework (FCRF), a novel Mentor-Actor architecture that enables LLMs to perform flexible self-reflection based on task difficulty, while constructively integrating historical valuable experience with failure lessons. We evaluated FCRF on diverse domestic tasks through simulation in AlfWorld and physical deployment in the real-world environment. Experimental results demonstrate that FCRF significantly improves overall performance and self-reflection flexibility in complex long-horizon robotic tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, IROS 2025</p></details> |

These settings are often characterized by high levels of bureaucracy, risk avoidance, and restricted autonomy. Patients frequently experience a profound loss of control over their lives, leading to heightened psychological stress-sometimes resulting in isolation as a safety measure. In this study, we explore how co-design can be used to collaboratively develop a companion robot that helps monitor and regulate stress while maintaining tracking of the patients' interaction behaviours for long-term intervention. We conducted four co-design workshops in a forensic psychiatric clinic with patients, caregivers, and therapists. Our process began with the presentation of an initial speculative prototype to therapists, enabling reflection on shared concerns, ethical risks, and desirable features. This was followed by a creative ideation session with patients, a third workshop focused on defining desired functions and emotional responses, and we are planning a final prototype demo to gather direct patient feedback. Our findings emphasize the importance of empowering patients in the design process and adapting proposals based on their current emotional state.

Adaptive Robot Task Planning in Human-Robot Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01483v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptive task planning is fundamental to ensuring effective and seamless human-robot collaboration. This paper introduces a robot task planning framework that takes into account both human leading/following preferences and performance, specifically focusing on task allocation and scheduling in collaborative settings. We present a proactive task allocation approach with three primary objectives: enhancing team performance, incorporating human preferences, and upholding a positive human perception of the robot and the collaborative experience. Through a user study, involving an autonomous mobile manipulator robot working alongside participants in a collaborative scenario, we confirm that the task planning framework successfully attains all three intended goals, thereby contributing to the advancement of adaptive task planning in human-robot collaboration. This paper mainly focuses on the first two objectives, and we discuss the third objective, participants' perception of the robot, tasks, and collaboration in a companion paper.</p></details> |  |

Language driven robotic grasping (LDRG) predicts stable grasp poses from natural language queries and RGB-D images. We propose MapleGrasp, a novel framework that leverages mask-guided feature pooling for efficient vision-language driven grasping. Our two-stage training first predicts segmentation masks from CLIP-based vision-language features. The second stage pools features within these masks to generate pixel-level grasp predictions, improving efficiency, and reducing computation. Incorporating mask pooling results in a 7% improvement over prior approaches on the OCID-VLG benchmark. Furthermore, we introduce RefGraspNet, an open-source dataset eight times larger than existing alternatives, significantly enhancing model generalization for open-vocabulary grasping. MapleGrasp scores a strong grasping accuracy of 89\% when compared with competing methods in the RefGraspNet benchmark. Our method achieves comparable performance to larger Vision-Language-Action models on the LIBERO benchmark, and shows significantly better generalization to unseen tasks. Real-world experiments on a Franka arm demonstrate 73% success rate with unseen objects, surpassing competitive baselines by 11%. Code will be released after publication.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce X-Nav, a novel framework for end-to-end cross-embodiment navigation where a single unified policy can be deployed across various embodiments for both wheeled and quadrupedal robots. X-Nav consists of two learning stages: 1) multiple expert policies are trained using deep reinforcement learning with privileged observations on a wide range of randomly generated robot embodiments; and 2) a single general policy is distilled from the expert policies via navigation action chunking with transformer (Nav-ACT). The general policy directly maps visual and proprioceptive observations to low-level control commands, enabling generalization to novel robot embodiments. Simulated experiments demonstrated that X-Nav achieved zero-shot transfer to both unseen embodiments and photorealistic environments. A scalability study showed that the performance of X-Nav improves when trained with an increasing number of randomly generated embodiments. An ablation study confirmed the design choices of X-Nav. Furthermore, real-world experiments were conducted to validate the generalizability of X-Nav in real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

Enhancing autonomy on the Gateway presents several unique challenges, one of which is to equip the Canadarm3, the Gateway's external robotic system, with the capability to perform worksite monitoring. Monitoring will involve using the arm's inspection cameras to detect any anomalies within the operating environment, a task complicated by the widely-varying lighting conditions in space. In this paper, we introduce the visual anomaly detection and localization task for space applications and establish a benchmark with our novel synthetic dataset called ALLO (for Anomaly Localization in Lunar Orbit). We develop a complete data generation pipeline to create ALLO, which we use to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art visual anomaly detection algorithms. Given the low tolerance for risk during space operations and the lack of relevant data, we emphasize the need for novel, robust, and accurate anomaly detection methods to handle the challenging visual conditions found in lunar orbit and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA'25), Atlanta, USA, May 19-23, 2025</p></details> |

The proposed framework integrates a data-driven front-end for instance segmentation from either RGBD cameras or LiDARs and a custom back-end for optimizing robot trajectories and object landmarks in the map. To allow multiple robots to merge their information, we design semantics-driven place recognition algorithms that leverage the informativeness and viewpoint invariance of the object-level metric-semantic map for inter-robot loop closure detection. A communication module is designed to track each robot's observations and those of other robots whenever communication links are available. The framework supports real-time, decentralized operation onboard the robots and has been integrated with three types of aerial and ground platforms. We validate its effectiveness through experiments in both indoor and outdoor environments, as well as benchmarks on public datasets and comparisons with existing methods. The framework is open-sourced and suitable for both single-agent and multi-robot real-time metric-semantic SLAM applications.

| **[BT-TL-DMPs: A Novel Robot TAMP Framework Combining Behavior Tree, Temporal Logic and Dynamical Movement Primitives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14582v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of Learning from Demonstration (LfD), enabling robots to generalize learned manipulation skills to novel scenarios for long-horizon tasks remains challenging. Specifically, it is still difficult for robots to adapt the learned skills to new environments with different task and motion requirements, especially in long-horizon, multi-stage scenarios with intricate constraints. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical framework, called BT-TL-DMPs, that integrates Behavior Tree (BT), Temporal Logic (TL), and Dynamical Movement Primitives (DMPs) to address this problem. Within this framework, Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is employed to formally specify complex, long-horizon task requirements and constraints. These STL specifications are systematically transformed to generate reactive and modular BTs for high-level decision-making task structure. An STL-constrained DMP optimization method is proposed to optimize the DMP forcing term, allowing the learned motion primitives to adapt flexibly while satisfying intricate spatiotemporal requirements and, crucially, preserving the essential dynamics learned from demonstrations. The framework is validated through simulations demonstrating generalization capabilities under various STL constraints and real-world experiments on several long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively bridges the symbolic-motion gap, enabling more reliable and generalizable autonomous manipulation for complex robotic tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

However, prior studies have found that existing dialogue pipelines for SARs remain limited in real-time latency, back-channeling, and personalized speech dialogue. Toward addressing these limitations, we propose using integrated end-to-end speech-language models (SLMs) with SARs. This work 1) evaluated the usability of an SLM-enabled SAR dialogue system through a small user study, and 2) identified remaining limitations through study user feedback to inform future improvements. We conducted a small within-participant user study with university students (N = 11) whose results showed that participants perceived an SLM-enabled SAR system as capable of providing empathetic feedback, natural turn-taking, back-channeling, and adaptive responses. We also found that participants reported the robot's nonverbal behaviors as lacking variability and synchronization with conversation, and the SLM's verbal feedback as generic and repetitive. These findings highlighted the need for real-time robot movement synchronized with conversation, improved prompting or fine-tuning to generate outputs better aligned with mental health practices, and more expressive, adaptive vocal generation.</p></details> |  |

As a result, we are seeing similar advancements in embodied AI and robotics for control policy generation. Our review paper examines the integration of generative AI models with RL to advance robotics. Our primary focus is on the duality between generative AI and RL for robotics downstream tasks. Specifically, we investigate: (1) The role of prominent generative AI tools as modular priors for multi-modal input fusion in RL tasks. (2) How RL can train, fine-tune and distill generative models for policy generation, such as VLA models, similarly to RL applications in large language models. We then propose a new taxonomy based on a considerable amount of selected papers. Lastly, we identify open challenges accounting for model scalability, adaptation and grounding, giving recommendations and insights on future research directions. We reflect on which generative AI models best fit the RL tasks and why. On the other side, we reflect on important issues inherent to RL-enhanced generative policies, such as safety concerns and failure modes, and what are the limitations of current methods.

Most robotic systems today treat their physical form as a fixed constraint rather than an adaptive resource, forcing the same rigid geometric representation to serve applications with vastly different computational and precision requirements. We introduce MorphIt, a novel algorithm for approximating robot morphology using spherical primitives that balances geometric accuracy with computational efficiency. Unlike existing approaches that rely on either labor-intensive manual specification or inflexible computational methods, MorphIt implements an automatic gradient-based optimization framework with tunable parameters that provides explicit control over the physical fidelity versus computational cost tradeoff. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that MorphIt outperforms baseline approaches (Variational Sphere Set Approximation and Adaptive Medial-Axis Approximation) across multiple metrics, achieving better mesh approximation with fewer spheres and reduced computational overhead. Our experiments show enhanced robot capabilities in collision detection accuracy, contact-rich interaction simulation, and navigation through confined spaces. By dynamically adapting geometric representations to task requirements, robots can now exploit their physical embodiment as an active resource rather than an inflexible parameter, opening new frontiers for manipulation in environments where physical form must continuously balance precision with computational tractability.</p></details> |  |

The STARFAB project aims to create a ground demonstration of an orbital automated warehouse as a hub for sustainable commercial operations and servicing. A critical part of this fully-autonomous robotic facility will be the capability to monitor, inspect, and assess the condition of both the components stored in the warehouse, and the STARFAB facility itself. This paper introduces ongoing work on the STARFAB Mobile Inspection Module (MIM). The MIM uses Standard Interconnects (SI) so that it can be carried by Walking Manipulators (WM) as an independently-mobile robot, and multiple MIMs can be stored and retrieved as needed for operations on STARFAB. The MIM carries high-resolution cameras, a 3D profilometer, and a thermal imaging sensor, with the capability to add other modular sensors. A grasping tool and torque wrench are stored within the modular body for use by an attached WM for maintenance operations. Implementation and testing is still ongoing at the time of writing. This paper details the concept of operations for the MIM as an on-orbit autonomous inspection and maintenance system, the mechanical and electronic design of the MIM, and the sensors package used for non-destructive testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of the Towards Autonomous Robotic Systems 2025 conference (TAROS 2025), York, UK 6 pages, one page of references, 6 figures</p></details> |

Deep neural networks have shown remarkable success in grasp synthesis by learning rich and abstract representations of objects. When deployed at the edge, these models can enable low-latency, low-power inference, making real-time grasping feasible in resource-constrained environments. This work implements Heatmap-Guided Grasp Detection, an end-to-end framework for the detection of 6-Dof grasp poses, on the GAP9 RISC-V System-on-Chip. The model is optimised using hardware-aware techniques, including input dimensionality reduction, model partitioning, and quantisation. Experimental evaluation on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark validates the feasibility of fully on-chip inference, highlighting the potential of low-power MCUs for real-time, autonomous manipulation.</p></details> | Accepted by SMC 2025 |

A recent study has shown how self-aggregation is possible in a multitask approach -- where multiple self-aggregation task instances occur concurrently in the same environment. The multitask approach poses new challenges, in special, how the dynamic of each group impacts the performance of others. So far, the multitask self-aggregation of groups of robots suffers from generating a circular formation -- that is not fully compact -- or is not fully autonomous. In this paper, we present a multitask self-aggregation where groups of homogeneous robots sort themselves into different compact clusters, relying solely on a line-of-sight sensor. Our multitask self-aggregation behavior was able to scale well and achieve a compact formation. We report scalability results from a series of simulation trials with different configurations in the number of groups and the number of robots per group. We were able to improve the multitask self-aggregation behavior performance in terms of the compactness of the clusters, keeping the proportion of clustered robots found in other studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages total (6 pages of content + 1 page of references).

However, achieving efficient whole-body control (WBC) in humanoids remains a fundamental challenge due to sophisticated dynamics, underactuation, and diverse task requirements. While learning-based controllers have shown promise for complex tasks, their reliance on labor-intensive and costly retraining for new scenarios limits real-world applicability. To address these limitations, behavior(al) foundation models (BFMs) have emerged as a new paradigm that leverages large-scale pre-training to learn reusable primitive skills and broad behavioral priors, enabling zero-shot or rapid adaptation to a wide range of downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of BFMs for humanoid WBC, tracing their development across diverse pre-training pipelines. Furthermore, we discuss real-world applications, current limitations, urgent challenges, and future opportunities, positioning BFMs as a key approach toward scalable and general-purpose humanoid intelligence. Finally, we provide a curated and long-term list of BFM papers and projects to facilitate more subsequent research, which is available at https://github.com/yuanmingqi/awesome-bfm-papers.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

This approach, similar to traditional online deep reinforcement learning, is particularly promising for robot control applications. Nevertheless, its robustness against real-world challenges, such as joint actuator faults in robots, remains a critical concern. This study evaluates the robustness of existing offline reinforcement learning methods using legged robots from OpenAI Gym based on average episodic rewards. For robustness evaluation, we simulate failures by incorporating both random and adversarial perturbations, representing worst-case scenarios, into the joint torque signals. Our experiments show that existing offline reinforcement learning methods exhibit significant vulnerabilities to these action perturbations and are more vulnerable than online reinforcement learning methods, highlighting the need for more robust approaches in this field.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |

Currently, most research focuses on proprioception-based methods, which lack the capability to overcome complex terrain. While visual perception is vital for operation in human-centric environments, its integration complicates control further. Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have shown promise in enhancing legged robot locomotion, particularly with proprioception-based methods. However, terrain adaptability, especially for bipedal robots, remains a significant challenge, with most research focusing on flat-terrain scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel mixture of experts teacher-student network RL strategy, which enhances the performance of teacher-student policies based on visual inputs through a simple yet effective approach. Our method combines terrain selection strategies with the teacher policy, resulting in superior performance compared to traditional models. Additionally, we introduce an alignment loss between the teacher and student networks, rather than enforcing strict similarity, to improve the student's ability to navigate diverse terrains. We validate our approach experimentally on the Limx Dynamic P1 bipedal robot, demonstrating its feasibility and robustness across multiple terrain types.</p></details> |  |

Numerous researchers have proposed optimization-based multi-robot localization methods that use camera, IMU, and UWB sensors. Nevertheless, characteristics of individual robot odometry estimates and distance measurements between robots used in the optimization are not sufficiently considered. In addition, previous researches were heavily influenced by the odometry accuracy that is estimated from individual robots. Consequently, long-term drift error caused by error accumulation is potentially inevitable. In this paper, we propose a novel visual-inertial-range-based multi-robot localization method, named SaWa-ML, which enables geometric structure-aware pose correction and weight adaptation-based robust multi-robot localization. Our contributions are twofold: (i) we leverage UWB sensor data, whose range error does not accumulate over time, to first estimate the relative positions between robots and then correct the positions of each robot, thus reducing long-term drift errors, (ii) we design adaptive weights for robot pose correction by considering the characteristics of the sensor data and visual-inertial odometry estimates. The proposed method has been validated in real-world experiments, showing a substantial performance increase compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

Commercially available direct leaf sensors are bulky, powered electronics that are expensive and interfere with crop growth. In contrast, low-cost, passive and bio-degradable leaf sensors offer an opportunity to advance real-time monitoring as they directly interface with the crop surface while not interfering with crop growth. To this end, we co-design a sensor-detector system, where the sensor is a passive colorimetric leaf sensor that directly measures crop health in a precision agriculture setting, and the detector autonomously obtains optical signals from these leaf sensors. The detector comprises a low size weight and power (SWaP) mobile ground robot with an onboard monocular RGB camera and object detector to localize each leaf sensor, as well as a hyperspectral camera with a motorized mirror and halogen light to acquire hyperspectral images. The sensor's crop health-dependent optical signals can be extracted from the hyperspectral images. The proof-of-concept system is demonstrated in row-crop environments both indoors and outdoors where it is able to autonomously navigate, locate and obtain a hyperspectral image of all leaf sensors present, and acquire interpretable spectral resonance with 80 $\%$ accuracy within a required retrieval distance from the sensor.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version.

The proposed method addresses key challenges in robotic locomotion, including accurate trajectory tracking under unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. By leveraging the repetitive nature of periodic gaits and extending ILC to nonperiodic tasks, the framework enhances accuracy and generalization across diverse locomotion scenarios. The control architecture is data-enabled, combining a physics-based model derived from hybrid-system trajectory optimization with real-time learning to compensate for model uncertainties and external disturbances. A central contribution is the development of a generalized TL that stores learned control profiles and enables rapid adaptation to changes in speed, terrain, and gravitational conditions-eliminating the need for repeated learning and significantly reducing online computation. The approach is validated on the bipedal robot Cassie and the quadrupedal robot A1 through extensive simulations and hardware experiments. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces joint tracking errors by up to 85% within a few seconds and enables reliable execution of both periodic and nonperiodic gaits, including slope traversal and terrain adaptation. Compared to state-of-the-art whole-body controllers, the learned skills eliminate the need for online computation during execution and achieve control update rates exceeding 30x those of existing methods. These findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating ILC with torque memory as a highly data-efficient and practical solution for legged locomotion in unstructured and dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

A potential treatment is capsule cleaning, a surgical procedure that requires enhanced visualization of the entire capsule and tool manipulation on the thin membrane. This article presents a robotic system capable of performing the capsule cleaning procedure by integrating a standard transpupillary and an intraocular optical coherence tomography probe on a surgical instrument for equatorial capsule visualization and real-time tool-to-tissue distance feedback. Using robot precision, the developed system enables complete capsule mapping in the pupillary and equatorial regions with in-situ calibration of refractive index and fiber offset, which are still current challenges in obtaining an accurate capsule model. To demonstrate effectiveness, the capsule mapping strategy was validated through five experimental trials on an eye phantom that showed reduced root-mean-square errors in the constructed capsule model, while the cleaning strategy was performed in three ex-vivo pig eyes without tissue damage.</p></details> | 12 pages, 27 figures |

Yet, LLM-powered conversational robots remain prone to errors, e.g., misunderstanding user intent, prematurely interrupting users, or failing to respond altogether. Detecting and addressing these failures is critical for preventing conversational breakdowns, avoiding task disruptions, and sustaining user trust. To tackle this problem, the ERR@HRI 2.0 Challenge provides a multimodal dataset of LLM-powered conversational robot failures during human-robot conversations and encourages researchers to benchmark machine learning models designed to detect robot failures. The dataset includes 16 hours of dyadic human-robot interactions, incorporating facial, speech, and head movement features. Each interaction is annotated with the presence or absence of robot errors from the system perspective, and perceived user intention to correct for a mismatch between robot behavior and user expectation. Participants are invited to form teams and develop machine learning models that detect these failures using multimodal data. Submissions will be evaluated using various performance metrics, including detection accuracy and false positive rate. This challenge represents another key step toward improving failure detection in human-robot interaction through social signal analysis.</p></details> |  |

The goal is to develop a robotic guide dog simulation capable of path following and obstacle avoidance, with long-term potential for real-world assistance to guide dogs and visually impaired individuals. It also seeks to expand research into medical 'pets', including robotic guide and alert dogs. A comparative analysis of thirteen related research papers shaped key evaluation criteria, including collision detection, pathfinding algorithms, sensor usage, robot type, and simulation platforms. The study focuses on sensor inputs, collision frequency, reward signals, and learning progression to determine which algorithm best supports robotic navigation in complex environments. Custom-made environments were used to ensure fair evaluation of all three algorithms under controlled conditions, allowing consistent data collection. Results show that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) outperformed Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Q-learning across all metrics, particularly in average and median steps to goal per episode. By analysing these results, this study contributes to robotic navigation, AI and medical robotics, offering insights into the feasibility of AI-driven quadruped mobility and its role in assistive robotics.</p></details> |  |

Critically, we include opportunities to apply not only physical robots but also the broader robotics toolkit - including planning, perception, control, and estimation algorithms - to climate-relevant problems. A central goal of this roadmap is to inspire new research directions and collaboration by highlighting specific, actionable problems at the intersection of robotics and climate. This work represents a collaboration between robotics researchers and domain experts in various climate disciplines, and it serves as an invitation to the robotics community to bring their expertise to bear on urgent climate priorities.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the autonomous museum guide robot Alter-Ego equipped with advanced navigation and interactive capabilities. The robot leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide real-time, context aware question-and-answer (Q&A) interactions, allowing visitors to engage in conversations about exhibits. It also employs robust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques, enabling seamless navigation through museum spaces and route adaptation based on user requests. The system was tested in a real museum environment with 34 participants, combining qualitative analysis of visitor-robot conversations and quantitative analysis of pre and post interaction surveys. Results showed that the robot was generally well-received and contributed to an engaging museum experience, despite some limitations in comprehension and responsiveness. This study sheds light on HRI in cultural spaces, highlighting not only the potential of AI-driven robotics to support accessibility and knowledge acquisition, but also the current limitations and challenges of deploying such technologies in complex, real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning Humans and Robots via Reinforcement Learning from Implicit Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13171v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) ap proaches often struggle to learn effective policies under sparse reward conditions, necessitating the manual design of complex, task-specific reward functions. To address this limitation, rein forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback (RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous, implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into probabilistic reward components, en abling effective policy learning even in the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2 robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned reinforcement learning in interactive robotics.</p></details> |  |

They are affordable, portable, and programmable, which makes them ideal for testing, data acquisition, controlling mobile robots, and many other robotic applications. A robotic system is proposed in this paper, consisting of an Android phone, a microcontroller board attached to the phone via USB, and a remote wireless controller station. In the data acquisition mode, the Android device can record a dataset of a diverse configuration of multiple cameras, IMUs, GNSS units, and external USB ADC channels in the rawest format used for, but not limited to, pose estimation and scene reconstruction applications. In robot control mode, the Android phone, a microcontroller board, and other peripherals constitute the mobile or stationary robotic system. This system is controlled using a remote server connected over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Experiments show that although the SLAM and AR applications can utilize the acquired data, the proposed system can pave the way for more advanced algorithms for processing these noisy and sporadic measurements. Moreover, the characteristics of the communication media are studied, and two example robotic projects, which involve controlling a toy car and a quadcopter, are included.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project repository: https://github.com/m-dayani/robo-platform Youtube Video: https://youtu.be/BTQ4yLB1bak Dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OZqdA1xa-SyJ64qL_TibqhtwhR1fWWrx?usp=sharing</p></details> |
| **[Human Demonstrations are Generalizable Knowledge for Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02419v3)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from human demonstrations is an emerging trend for designing intelligent robotic systems. However, previous methods typically regard videos as instructions, simply dividing them into action sequences for robotic repetition, which poses obstacles to generalization to diverse tasks or object instances. In this paper, we propose a different perspective, considering human demonstration videos not as mere instructions, but as a source of knowledge for robots. Motivated by this perspective and the remarkable comprehension and generalization capabilities exhibited by large language models (LLMs), we propose DigKnow, a method that DIstills Generalizable KNOWledge with a hierarchical structure. Specifically, DigKnow begins by converting human demonstration video frames into observation knowledge. This knowledge is then subjected to analysis to extract human action knowledge and further distilled into pattern knowledge compassing task and object instances, resulting in the acquisition of generalizable knowledge with a hierarchical structure. In settings with different tasks or object instances, DigKnow retrieves relevant knowledge for the current task and object instances. Subsequently, the LLM-based planner conducts planning based on the retrieved knowledge, and the policy executes actions in line with the plan to achieve the designated task. Utilizing the retrieved knowledge, we validate and rectify planning and execution outcomes, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the success rate. Experimental results across a range of tasks and scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in facilitating real-world robots to accomplish tasks with the knowledge derived from human demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication in lEEE/RSJ international Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (lROS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Online Learning and Adaptive Planning for Robotic Information Gathering Based on Streaming Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13053v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic information gathering (RIG) techniques refer to methods where mobile robots are used to acquire data about the physical environment with a suite of sensors. Informative planning is an important part of RIG where the goal is to find sequences of actions or paths that maximize efficiency or the quality of information collected. Many existing solutions solve this problem by assuming that the environment is known in advance. However, real environments could be unknown or time-varying, and adaptive informative planning remains an active area of research. Adaptive planning and incremental online mapping are required for mapping initially unknown or varying spatial fields. Gaussian process (GP) regression is a widely used technique in RIG for mapping continuous spatial fields. However, it falls short in many applications as its real-time performance does not scale well to large datasets. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient adaptive informative planning approach for mapping continuous scalar fields with GPs with streaming sparse GPs. Simulation experiments are performed with a synthetic dataset and compared against existing benchmarks. Finally, it is also verified with a real-world dataset to further validate the efficacy of the proposed method. Results show that our method achieves similar mapping accuracy to the baselines while reducing computational complexity for longer missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intelligent Virtual Sonographer (IVS): Enhancing Physician-Robot-Patient Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13052v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement and maturity of large language models (LLMs) and robotics have unlocked vast potential for human-computer interaction, particularly in the field of robotic ultrasound. While existing research primarily focuses on either patient-robot or physician-robot interaction, the role of an intelligent virtual sonographer (IVS) bridging physician-robot-patient communication remains underexplored. This work introduces a conversational virtual agent in Extended Reality (XR) that facilitates real-time interaction between physicians, a robotic ultrasound system(RUS), and patients. The IVS agent communicates with physicians in a professional manner while offering empathetic explanations and reassurance to patients. Furthermore, it actively controls the RUS by executing physician commands and transparently relays these actions to the patient. By integrating LLM-powered dialogue with speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and robotic control, our system enhances the efficiency, clarity, and accessibility of robotic ultrasound acquisition. This work constitutes a first step toward understanding how IVS can bridge communication gaps in physician-robot-patient interaction, providing more control and therefore trust into physician-robot interaction while improving patient experience and acceptance of robotic ultrasound.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[What Can Robots Teach Us About Trust and Reliance? An interdisciplinary dialogue between Social Sciences and Social Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13041v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As robots find their way into more and more aspects of everyday life, questions around trust are becoming increasingly important. What does it mean to trust a robot? And how should we think about trust in relationships that involve both humans and non-human agents? While the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has made trust a central topic, the concept is often approached in fragmented ways. At the same time, established work in sociology, where trust has long been a key theme, is rarely brought into conversation with developments in robotics. This article argues that we need a more interdisciplinary approach. By drawing on insights from both social sciences and social robotics, we explore how trust is shaped, tested and made visible. Our goal is to open up a dialogue between disciplines and help build a more grounded and adaptable framework for understanding trust in the evolving world of human-robot interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Force-Based Viscosity and Elasticity Measurements for Material Biomechanical Characterisation with a Collaborative Robotic Arm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11133v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnostic activities, such as ultrasound scans and palpation, are relatively low-cost. They play a crucial role in the early detection of health problems and in assessing their progression. However, they are also error-prone activities, which require highly skilled medical staff. The use of robotic solutions can be key to decreasing the inherent subjectivity of the results and reducing the waiting list. For a robot to perform palpation or ultrasound scans, it must effectively manage physical interactions with the human body, which greatly benefits from precise estimation of the patient's tissue biomechanical properties. This paper assesses the accuracy and precision of a robotic system in estimating the viscoelastic parameters of various materials, including some tests on ex vivo tissues as a preliminary proof-of-concept demonstration of the method's applicability to biological samples. The measurements are compared against a ground truth derived from silicone specimens with different viscoelastic properties, characterised using a high-precision instrument. Experimental results show that the robotic system's accuracy closely matches the ground truth, increasing confidence in the potential use of robots for such clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[DEMONSTRATE: Zero-shot Language to Robotic Control via Multi-task Demonstration Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12855v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) with control systems has demonstrated significant potential in various settings, such as task completion with a robotic manipulator. A main reason for this success is the ability of LLMs to perform in-context learning, which, however, strongly relies on the design of task examples, closely related to the target tasks. Consequently, employing LLMs to formulate optimal control problems often requires task examples that contain explicit mathematical expressions, designed by trained engineers. Furthermore, there is often no principled way to evaluate for hallucination before task execution. To address these challenges, we propose DEMONSTRATE, a novel methodology that avoids the use of LLMs for complex optimization problem generations, and instead only relies on the embedding representations of task descriptions. To do this, we leverage tools from inverse optimal control to replace in-context prompt examples with task demonstrations, as well as the concept of multitask learning, which ensures target and example task similarity by construction. Given the fact that hardware demonstrations can easily be collected using teleoperation or guidance of the robot, our approach significantly reduces the reliance on engineering expertise for designing in-context examples. Furthermore, the enforced multitask structure enables learning from few demonstrations and assessment of hallucinations prior to task execution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulation and hardware experiments involving a robotic arm tasked with tabletop manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Predict Mobile Robot Stability in Off-Road Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12731v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating in off-road environments for wheeled mobile robots is challenging due to dynamic and rugged terrain. Traditional physics-based stability metrics, such as Static Stability Margin (SSM) or Zero Moment Point (ZMP) require knowledge of contact forces, terrain geometry, and the robot's precise center-of-mass that are difficult to measure accurately in real-world field conditions. In this work, we propose a learning-based approach to estimate robot platform stability directly from proprioceptive data using a lightweight neural network, IMUnet. Our method enables data-driven inference of robot stability without requiring an explicit terrain model or force sensing. We also develop a novel vision-based ArUco tracking method to compute a scalar score to quantify robot platform stability called C3 score. The score captures image-space perturbations over time as a proxy for physical instability and is used as a training signal for the neural network based model. As a pilot study, we evaluate our approach on data collected across multiple terrain types and speeds and demonstrate generalization to previously unseen conditions. These initial results highlight the potential of using IMU and robot velocity as inputs to estimate platform stability. The proposed method finds application in gating robot tasks such as precision actuation and sensing, especially for mobile manipulation tasks in agricultural and space applications. Our learning method also provides a supervision mechanism for perception based traversability estimation and planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Natha...</summary><p>Nathaniel Rose and Arif Ahmed contributed equally to this work.

Existing methods are not suitable for scale applications due to large deployment costs in high-resolution sensing applications such as for variable irrigation. In this work, we design, build and field deploy an autonomous mobile robot, MoistureMapper, for soil moisture sensing. The robot is equipped with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors and a direct push drill mechanism for deploying the sensor to measure volumetric water content in the soil. Additionally, we implement and evaluate multiple adaptive sampling strategies based on a Gaussian Process based modeling to build a spatial mapping of moisture distribution in the soil. We present results from large scale computational simulations and proof-of-concept deployment on the field. The adaptive sampling approach outperforms a greedy benchmark approach and results in up to 30\% reduction in travel distance and 5\% reduction in variance in the reconstructed moisture maps.

Our approach extends MAPPO by integrating spatial action maps, robot motion planning, intention sharing, and task allocation revision to enable effective and adaptive coalition formation. Extensive simulation studies confirm the effectiveness of our model, enabling each robot to rely solely on local information to learn timely revisions of task selections and form coalitions with other robots to complete collaborative tasks. The results also highlight the proposed framework's ability to handle large robot populations and adapt to scenarios with diverse task sets.</p></details> |  |

As such, these capabilities are often regarded as measurable indicators of intelligence across biological species. While much of today's research on robotic intelligence focuses on generating better controllers, inventing smarter tools offers a complementary form of physical intelligence: shifting the onus of problem-solving onto the tool's design. Given the vast and impressive common-sense, reasoning, and creative capabilities of today's foundation models, we investigate whether these models can provide useful priors to automatically design and effectively wield such tools? We present VLMgineer, a framework that harnesses the code generation abilities of vision language models (VLMs) together with evolutionary search to iteratively co-design physical tools and the action plans that operate them to perform a task. We evaluate VLMgineer on a diverse new benchmark of everyday manipulation scenarios that demand creative tool design and use. Across this suite, VLMgineer consistently discovers tools and policies that solve tasks more effectively and innovatively, transforming challenging robotics problems into straightforward executions. It also outperforms VLM-generated designs from human specifications and existing human-crafted tools for everyday tasks. To facilitate future research on automated tool invention, we will release our benchmark and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://vlmgineer.github.io/release</p></details> |

Exploring Contextual Privacy and Security Concerns Toward Domestic Social Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10786v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced sensing capabilities, social robots are gaining interest among consumers in the United States. These robots seem like a natural evolution of traditional smart home devices. However, their extensive data collection capabilities, anthropomorphic features, and capacity to interact with their environment make social robots a more significant security and privacy threat. Increased risks include data linkage, unauthorized data sharing, and the physical safety of users and their homes. It is critical to investigate U.S. users' security and privacy needs and concerns to guide the design of social robots while these devices are still in the early stages of commercialization in the U.S. market. Through 19 semi-structured interviews, we identified significant security and privacy concerns, highlighting the need for transparency, usability, and robust privacy controls to support adoption. For educational applications, participants worried most about misinformation, and in medical use cases, they worried about the reliability of these devices. Participants were also concerned with the data inference that social robots could enable. We found that participants expect tangible privacy controls, indicators of data collection, and context-appropriate functionality.</p></details> |  |

This paper assesses visual input's utility for multimodal LLMs in such tasks via a comprehensive benchmark. We evaluated 15 multimodal LLMs on generating valid and optimal paths in 2D grid environments, simulating simplified robotic planning, comparing text-only versus text-plus-visual inputs across varying model sizes and grid complexities. Our results indicate moderate success rates on simpler small grids, where visual input or few-shot text prompting offered some benefits. However, performance significantly degraded on larger grids, highlighting a scalability challenge. While larger models generally achieved higher average success, the visual modality was not universally dominant over well-structured text for these multimodal systems, and successful paths on simpler grids were generally of high quality. These results indicate current limitations in robust spatial reasoning, constraint adherence, and scalable multimodal integration, identifying areas for future LLM development in robotic path planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 SICE Festival with Annual Conference (SICE FES)</p></details> |

Musical tasks, like drumming, present unique challenges, including split-second timing, rapid contacts, and multi-limb coordination over performances lasting minutes. In this paper, we introduce Robot Drummer, a humanoid capable of expressive, high-precision drumming across a diverse repertoire of songs. We formulate humanoid drumming as sequential fulfillment of timed contacts and transform drum scores into a Rhythmic Contact Chain. To handle the long-horizon nature of musical performance, we decompose each piece into fixed-length segments and train a single policy across all segments in parallel using reinforcement learning. Through extensive experiments on over thirty popular rock, metal, and jazz tracks, our results demonstrate that Robot Drummer consistently achieves high F1 scores. The learned behaviors exhibit emergent human-like drumming strategies, such as cross-arm strikes, and adaptive stick assignments, demonstrating the potential of reinforcement learning to bring humanoid robots into the domain of creative musical performance.

In contrast, robots today are primarily monolithic machines with limited ability to self-repair, physically develop, or incorporate material from their environments. While robot minds rapidly evolve new behaviors through AI, their bodies remain closed systems, unable to systematically integrate material to grow or heal. We argue that open-ended physical adaptation is only possible when robots are designed using a small repertoire of simple modules. This allows machines to mechanically adapt by consuming parts from other machines or their surroundings and shed broken components. We demonstrate this principle on a truss modular robot platform. We show how robots can grow bigger, faster, and more capable by consuming materials from their environment and other robots. We suggest that machine metabolic processes like those demonstrated here will be an essential part of any sustained future robot ecology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript combined with Supplementary Materials File for arXiv submission</p></details> |
