| **[Embodied Navigation Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12129v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation is a fundamental capability in embodied AI, representing the intelligence required to perceive and interact within physical environments following language instructions. Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks. Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pku-epic.github.io/NavFoM-Web/</p></details> |
| **[PANORAMA: The Rise of Omnidirectional Vision in the Embodied AI Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12989v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omnidirectional vision, using 360-degree vision to understand the environment, has become increasingly critical across domains like robotics, industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Compared to traditional pinhole vision, omnidirectional vision provides holistic environmental awareness, significantly enhancing the completeness of scene perception and the reliability of decision-making. However, foundational research in this area has historically lagged behind traditional pinhole vision. This talk presents an emerging trend in the embodied AI era: the rapid development of omnidirectional vision, driven by growing industrial demand and academic interest. We highlight recent breakthroughs in omnidirectional generation, omnidirectional perception, omnidirectional understanding, and related datasets. Drawing on insights from both academia and industry, we propose an ideal panoramic system architecture in the embodied AI era, PANORAMA, which consists of four key subsystems. Moreover, we offer in-depth opinions related to emerging trends and cross-community impacts at the intersection of panoramic vision and embodied AI, along with the future roadmap and open challenges. This overview synthesizes state-of-the-art advancements and outlines challenges and opportunities for future research in building robust, general-purpose omnidirectional AI systems in the embodied AI era.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper presents a draft overview of the emerging field of omnidirectional vision in the context of embodied AI</p></details> |
| **[Learning Precise Affordances from Egocentric Videos for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10123v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Affordance, defined as the potential actions that an object offers, is crucial for embodied AI agents. For example, such knowledge directs an agent to grasp a knife by the handle for cutting or by the blade for safe handover. While existing approaches have made notable progress, affordance research still faces three key challenges: data scarcity, poor generalization, and real-world deployment. Specifically, there is a lack of large-scale affordance datasets with precise segmentation maps, existing models struggle to generalize across different domains or novel object and affordance classes, and little work demonstrates deployability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address these issues by proposing a complete affordance learning system that (1) takes in egocentric videos and outputs precise affordance annotations without human labeling, (2) leverages geometric information and vision foundation models to improve generalization, and (3) introduces a framework that facilitates affordance-oriented robotic manipulation such as tool grasping and robot-to-human tool handover. Experimental results show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art by 13.8% in mIoU, and the framework achieves 77.1% successful grasping among 179 trials, including evaluations on seen, unseen classes, and cluttered scenes.

| **[Integrating Prior Observations for Incremental 3D Scene Graph Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11895v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D semantic scene graphs (3DSSG) provide compact structured representations of environments by explicitly modeling objects, attributes, and relationships. While 3DSSGs have shown promise in robotics and embodied AI, many existing methods rely mainly on sensor data, not integrating further information from semantically rich environments. Additionally, most methods assume access to complete scene reconstructions, limiting their applicability in real-world, incremental settings. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph model for incremental 3DSSG prediction that integrates additional, multi-modal information, such as prior observations, directly into the message-passing process. Utilizing multiple layers, the model flexibly incorporates global and local scene representations without requiring specialized modules or full scene reconstructions. We evaluate our approach on the 3DSSG dataset, showing that GNNs enriched with multi-modal information such as semantic embeddings (e.g., CLIP) and prior observations offer a scalable and generalizable solution for complex, real-world environments. The full source code of the presented architecture will be made available at https://github.com/m4renz/incremental-scene-graph-prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 24th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA'25)</p></details> |
| **[INGRID: Intelligent Generative Robotic Design Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03842v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has accelerated progress in embodied artificial intelligence, yet current approaches remain constrained by existing robotic architectures, particularly serial mechanisms. This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware, potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[RoboBrain 2.0 Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02029v5)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce RoboBrain 2.0, our latest generation of embodied vision-language foundation models, designed to unify perception, reasoning, and planning for complex embodied tasks in physical environments. It comes in two variants: a lightweight 7B model and a full-scale 32B model, featuring a heterogeneous architecture with a vision encoder and a language model. Despite its compact size, RoboBrain 2.0 achieves strong performance across a wide spectrum of embodied reasoning tasks. On both spatial and temporal benchmarks, the 32B variant achieves leading results, surpassing prior open-source and proprietary models. In particular, it supports key real-world embodied AI capabilities, including spatial understanding (e.g., affordance prediction, spatial referring, trajectory forecasting) and temporal decision-making (e.g., closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction, multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We hope RoboBrain 2.0 advances embodied AI research and serves as a practical step toward building generalist embodied agents. The code, checkpoint and benchmark are available at https://superrobobrain.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nav-R1: Reasoning and Navigation in Embodied Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10884v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied navigation requires agents to integrate perception, reasoning, and action for robust interaction in complex 3D environments. Existing approaches often suffer from incoherent and unstable reasoning traces that hinder generalization across diverse environments, and difficulty balancing long-horizon semantic reasoning with low-latency control for real-time navigation. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-R1, an embodied foundation model that unifies reasoning in embodied environments. We first construct Nav-CoT-110K, a large-scale dataset of step-by-step Chains-of-Thought (CoT) for embodied tasks, which enables cold-start initialization with structured reasoning. Building on this foundation, we design a GRPO-based reinforcement learning framework with three complementary rewards: format, understanding, and navigation, to improve structural adherence, semantic grounding, and path fidelity. Furthermore, we introduce a Fast-in-Slow reasoning paradigm, decoupling deliberate semantic reasoning from low-latency reactive control for efficient yet coherent navigation. Extensive evaluations on embodied AI benchmarks demonstrate that Nav-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, with over 8% average improvement in reasoning and navigation performance. Real-world deployment on a mobile robot further validates its robustness under limited onboard resources. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/Nav-R1.

| **[InternScenes: A Large-scale Simulatable Indoor Scene Dataset with Realistic Layouts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10813v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of Embodied AI heavily relies on large-scale, simulatable 3D scene datasets characterized by scene diversity and realistic layouts. However, existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity, sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528v6)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p></details> | CoRL 2025 |
| **[Boosting Embodied AI Agents through Perception-Generation Disaggregation and Asynchronous Pipeline Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09560v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems operate in dynamic environments, requiring seamless integration of perception and generation modules to process high-frequency input and output demands. Traditional sequential computation patterns, while effective in ensuring accuracy, face significant limitations in achieving the necessary "thinking" frequency for real-world applications. In this work, we present Auras, an algorithm-system co-designed inference framework to optimize the inference frequency of embodied AI agents. Auras disaggregates the perception and generation and provides controlled pipeline parallelism for them to achieve high and stable throughput. Faced with the data staleness problem that appears when the parallelism is increased, Auras establishes a public context for perception and generation to share, thereby promising the accuracy of embodied agents. Experimental results show that Auras improves throughput by 2.54x on average while achieving 102.7% of the original accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in overcoming the constraints of sequential computation and providing high throughput.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attribution Regularization for Multimodal Paradigms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02359v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal machine learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential for integrating information from multiple modalities to enhance learning and decision-making processes. However, it is commonly observed that unimodal models outperform multimodal models, despite the latter having access to richer information. Additionally, the influence of a single modality often dominates the decision-making process, resulting in suboptimal performance. This research project aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel regularization term that encourages multimodal models to effectively utilize information from all modalities when making decisions. The focus of this project lies in the video-audio domain, although the proposed regularization technique holds promise for broader applications in embodied AI research, where multiple modalities are involved. By leveraging this regularization term, the proposed approach aims to mitigate the issue of unimodal dominance and improve the performance of multimodal machine learning systems. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed technique will be assessed. The findings of this research project have the potential to significantly contribute to the advancement of multimodal machine learning and facilitate its application in various domains, including multimedia analysis, human-computer interaction, and embodied AI research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12312v4)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based spatial cognition is vital for robotics and embodied AI but challenges current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This paper makes two key contributions. First, we introduce ViCA (Visuospatial Cognitive Assistant)-322K, a diverse dataset of 322,003 QA pairs from real-world indoor videos (ARKitScenes, ScanNet, ScanNet++), offering supervision for 3D metadata-grounded queries and video-based complex reasoning. Second, we develop ViCA-7B, fine-tuned on ViCA-322K, which achieves new state-of-the-art on all eight VSI-Bench tasks, outperforming existing models, including larger ones (e.g., +26.1 on Absolute Distance). For interpretability, we present ViCA-Thinking-2.68K, a dataset with explicit reasoning chains, and fine-tune ViCA-7B to create ViCA-7B-Thinking, a model that articulates its spatial reasoning. Our work highlights the importance of targeted data and suggests paths for improved temporal-spatial modeling. We release all resources to foster research in robust visuospatial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[F1: A Vision-Language-Action Model Bridging Understanding and Generation to Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06951v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Executing language-conditioned tasks in dynamic visual environments remains a central challenge in embodied AI. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception, foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation, and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1 consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in both task success rate and generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://aopolin-lv.github.io/F1-VLA/</p></details> |
| **[LatticeWorld: A Multimodal Large Language Model-Empowered Framework for Interactive Complex World Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05263v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents, featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a $90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

| **[Generative World Explorer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11844v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: generative-world-explorer.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Spatial Reasoning with Vision-Language Models in Ego-Centric Multi-View Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06266v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data. Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal Multi-Task (M3T) Federated Foundation Models for Embodied AI: Potentials and Challenges for Edge Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11191v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As embodied AI systems become increasingly multi-modal, personalized, and interactive, they must learn effectively from diverse sensory inputs, adapt continually to user preferences, and operate safely under resource and privacy constraints. These challenges expose a pressing need for machine learning models capable of swift, context-aware adaptation while balancing model generalization and personalization. Here, two methods emerge as suitable candidates, each offering parts of these capabilities: multi-modal multi-task foundation models (M3T-FMs) provide a pathway toward generalization across tasks and modalities, whereas federated learning (FL) offers the infrastructure for distributed, privacy-preserving model updates and user-level model personalization. However, when used in isolation, each of these approaches falls short of meeting the complex and diverse capability requirements of real-world embodied AI environments. In this vision paper, we introduce multi-modal multi-task federated foundation models (M3T-FFMs) for embodied AI, a new paradigm that unifies the strengths of M3T-FMs with the privacy-preserving distributed training nature of FL, enabling intelligent systems at the wireless edge. We collect critical deployment dimensions of M3T-FFMs in embodied AI ecosystems under a unified framework, which we name "EMBODY": Embodiment heterogeneity, Modality richness and imbalance, Bandwidth and compute constraints, On-device continual learning, Distributed control and autonomy, and Yielding safety, privacy, and personalization. For each, we identify concrete challenges and envision actionable research directions. We also present an evaluation framework for deploying M3T-FFMs in embodied AI systems, along with the associated trade-offs. Finally, we present a prototype implementation of M3T-FFMs and evaluate their energy and latency performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication in IEEE Internet of Things Magazine, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Plan Verification for LLM-Based Embodied Task Completion Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02761v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions, redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches, our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout). The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[HLG: Comprehensive 3D Room Construction via Hierarchical Layout Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17832v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic 3D indoor scene generation is crucial for virtual reality, interior design, embodied intelligence, and scene understanding. While existing methods have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication to encourage future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[World Model Implanting for Test-time Adaptation of Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03956v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models, the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability. In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied AI: Emerging Risks and Opportunities for Policy Action](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00117v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of embodied AI (EAI) is rapidly advancing. Unlike virtual AI, EAI systems can exist in, learn from, reason about, and act in the physical world. With recent advances in AI models and hardware, EAI systems are becoming increasingly capable across wider operational domains. While EAI systems can offer many benefits, they also pose significant risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, as well as economic and societal disruption. These risks require urgent attention from policymakers, as existing policies governing industrial robots and autonomous vehicles are insufficient to address the full range of concerns EAI systems present. To help address this issue, this paper makes three contributions. First, we provide a taxonomy of the physical, informational, economic, and social risks EAI systems pose. Second, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to assess how existing frameworks address these risks and to identify critical gaps. We conclude by offering policy recommendations for the safe and beneficial deployment of EAI systems, such as mandatory testing and certification schemes, clarified liability frameworks, and strategies to manage EAI's potentially transformative economic and societal impacts.</p></details> |  |
| **[ANNIE: Be Careful of Your Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03383v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI) robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety, how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries; (2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with 2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3) ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era.

| **[A Survey: Learning Embodied Intelligence from Physical Simulators and World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00917v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) has placed embodied intelligence at the forefront of robotics research. Embodied intelligence focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the physical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only advanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract cognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest. Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the integration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their complementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in intelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and internal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world deployment. By synthesizing current progress and identifying open challenges, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the path toward more capable and generalizable embodied AI systems. We also maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date literature and open-source projects at https://github.com/NJU3DV-LoongGroup/Embodied-World-Models-Survey.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update with recent progresses. 49pages, 25figures, 6tables, github repository avalible in https://github.com/NJU3DV-LoongGroup/Embodied-World-Models-Survey</p></details> |
| **[Omnidirectional Spatial Modeling from Correlated Panoramas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02164v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the \textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories (\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[FGO-SLAM: Enhancing Gaussian SLAM with Globally Consistent Opacity Radiance Field](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01547v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual SLAM has regained attention due to its ability to provide perceptual capabilities and simulation test data for Embodied AI. However, traditional SLAM methods struggle to meet the demands of high-quality scene reconstruction, and Gaussian SLAM systems, despite their rapid rendering and high-quality mapping capabilities, lack effective pose optimization methods and face challenges in geometric reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce FGO-SLAM, a Gaussian SLAM system that employs an opacity radiance field as the scene representation to enhance geometric mapping performance. After initial pose estimation, we apply global adjustment to optimize camera poses and sparse point cloud, ensuring robust tracking of our approach. Additionally, we maintain a globally consistent opacity radiance field based on 3D Gaussians and introduce depth distortion and normal consistency terms to refine the scene representation. Furthermore, after constructing tetrahedral grids, we identify level sets to directly extract surfaces from 3D Gaussians. Results across various real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art tracking accuracy and mapping performance.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |
| **[Large VLM-based Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13073v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation, a key frontier in robotics and embodied AI, requires precise motor control and multimodal understanding, yet traditional rule-based methods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured, novel environments. In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

| **[A Survey on Vision-Language-Action Models for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14093v5)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI is widely recognized as a key element of artificial general intelligence because it involves controlling embodied agents to perform tasks in the physical world. Building on the success of large language models and vision-language models, a new category of multimodal models -- referred to as vision-language-action models (VLAs) -- has emerged to address language-conditioned robotic tasks in embodied AI by leveraging their distinct ability to generate actions. In recent years, a myriad of VLAs have been developed, making it imperative to capture the rapidly evolving landscape through a comprehensive survey. To this end, we present the first survey on VLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized into three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual components of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies adept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task planners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks, thereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we provide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets, simulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs and outline promising future directions in embodied AI. We have created a project associated with this survey, which is available at https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/yueen-ma/Awesome-VLA</p></details> |
| **[RobotxR1: Enabling Embodied Robotic Intelligence on Large Language Models through Closed-Loop Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03238v2)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future robotic systems operating in real-world environments will require on-board embodied intelligence without continuous cloud connection, balancing capabilities with constraints on computational power and memory. This work presents an extension of the R1-zero approach, which enables the usage of low parameter-count Large Language Models (LLMs) in the robotic domain. The R1-Zero approach was originally developed to enable mathematical reasoning in LLMs using static datasets. We extend it to the robotics domain through integration in a closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. This extension enhances reasoning in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) settings without relying solely on distillation of large models through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We show that small-scale LLMs can achieve effective reasoning performance by learning through closed-loop interaction with their environment, which enables tasks that previously required significantly larger models. In an autonomous driving setting, a performance gain of 20.2%-points over the SFT-based baseline is observed with a Qwen2.5-1.5B model. Using the proposed training procedure, Qwen2.5-3B achieves a 63.3% control adaptability score, surpassing the 58.5% obtained by the much larger, cloud-bound GPT-4o. These results highlight that practical, on-board deployment of small LLMs is not only feasible but can outperform larger models if trained through environmental feedback, underscoring the importance of an interactive learning framework for robotic Embodied AI, one grounded in practical experience rather than static supervision.</p></details> |  |

This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and cognitive processes, including object recognition and decision-making. While substantial advancements in perception have been driven by the rapid development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states, ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and RoboTHOR benchmarks demonstrate that our cognitive process modeling significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14% over the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the emergence of Multi-modal Large Models (MLMs) and World Models (WMs) have attracted significant attention due to their remarkable perception, interaction, and reasoning capabilities, making them a promising architecture for embodied agents. In this survey, we give a comprehensive exploration of the latest advancements in Embodied AI. Our analysis firstly navigates through the forefront of representative works of embodied robots and simulators, to fully understand the research focuses and their limitations. Then, we analyze four main research targets: 1) embodied perception, 2) embodied interaction, 3) embodied agent, and 4) sim-to-real adaptation, covering state-of-the-art methods, essential paradigms, and comprehensive datasets. Additionally, we explore the complexities of MLMs in virtual and real embodied agents, highlighting their significance in facilitating interactions in digital and physical environments. Finally, we summarize the challenges and limitations of embodied AI and discuss potential future directions. We hope this survey will serve as a foundational reference for the research community.

Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lanlan96.github.io/BoxFusion/</p></details> |
| **[FetchBot: Learning Generalizable Object Fetching in Cluttered Scenes via Zero-Shot Sim2Real](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17894v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizable object fetching in cluttered scenes remains a fundamental and application-critical challenge in embodied AI. Closely packed objects cause inevitable occlusions, making safe action generation particularly difficult. Under such partial observability, effective policies must not only generalize across diverse objects and layouts but also reason about occlusion to avoid collisions. However, collecting large-scale real-world data for this task remains prohibitively expensive, leaving this problem largely unsolved. In this paper, we introduce FetchBot, a sim-to-real framework for this challenge. We first curate a large-scale synthetic dataset featuring 1M diverse scenes and 500k representative demonstrations. Based on this dataset, FetchBot employs a depth-conditioned method for action generation, which leverages structural cues to enable robust obstacle-aware action planning. However, depth is perfect in simulation but noisy in real-world environments. To address this sim-to-real gap, FetchBot predicts depth from RGB inputs using a foundation model and integrates local occupancy prediction as a pre-training task, providing a generalizable latent representation for sim-to-real transfer. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the strong zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, effective clutter handling, and adaptability to novel scenarios. In cluttered environments, it achieves an average real-world success rate of 89.95%, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, FetchBot demonstrates excellent robustness in challenging cases, such as fetching transparent, reflective, and irregular objects, highlighting its practical value.</p></details> | <details><summary>9th A...</summary><p>9th Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025, Oral)</p></details> |

In this work, we address the challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture. Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval; (ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of 3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass; (iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation, potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks.

However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution, and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands. This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500 complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot. We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.</p></details> |  |

Firstly, it chronicles the developmental trajectory of VLA architectures. Subsequently, we conduct a detailed analysis of current research across 5 critical dimensions: VLA model structures, training datasets, pre-training methods, post-training methods, and model evaluation. Finally, we synthesize key challenges in VLA development and real-world deployment, while outlining promising future research directions.</p></details> | in Chinese language |

To formalize this setting, we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by both LLM-based and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages + 2 pages references + 7 pages appendix</p></details> |

However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity, offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment of visual-language models across reasoning levels.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design. Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5% across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning, representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm, offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action gap in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Embod...</summary><p>Embodied-R1 technical report</p></details> |

In this survey, we first systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases, Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based Retrieval, Representation Alignment-Based Retrieval, Graph-Structure-Based Retrieval, Generation Model-Based Retrieval, and Efficient Retrieval-Based Optimization), revealing a fundamental tension between achieving long-term semantic coherence and maintaining real-time responsiveness. Based on this comprehensive analysis, we identify key bottlenecks, spanning from the foundational Physical Grounding Gap to systemic challenges in cross-modal integration, dynamic adaptation, and open-world generalization. Finally, we outline a forward-looking research agenda encompassing physics-aware data models, adaptive storage-retrieval co-optimization, and standardized benchmarking, to guide future research toward principled data management solutions for EAI. Our survey is based on a comprehensive review of more than 180 related studies, providing a rigorous roadmap for designing the robust, high-performance data management frameworks essential for the next generation of autonomous embodied systems.</p></details> |  |

However, standardized benchmarks for evaluating robotic athletic performance in real-world settings and in direct comparison to humans remain scarce. We present Switch4EAI(Switch-for-Embodied-AI), a low-cost and easily deployable pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games to evaluate whole-body robot control policies. Using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch as a representative example, our system captures, reconstructs, and retargets in-game choreography for robotic execution. We validate the system on a Unitree G1 humanoid with an open-source whole-body controller, establishing a quantitative baseline for the robot's performance against a human player. In the paper, we discuss these results, which demonstrate the feasibility of using commercial games platform as physically grounded benchmarks and motivate future work to for benchmarking embodied AI.</p></details> | Workshop Submission |
| **[Virtuous Machines: Towards Artificial General Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13421v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness, executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments, accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored. It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and the attribution of scientific credit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embodied Image Quality Assessment for Robotic Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18774v3)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Quality Assessment (IQA) of User-Generated Content (UGC) is a critical technique for human Quality of Experience (QoE). However, does the the image quality of Robot-Generated Content (RGC) demonstrate traits consistent with the Moravec paradox, potentially conflicting with human perceptual norms? Human subjective scoring is more based on the attractiveness of the image. Embodied agent are required to interact and perceive in the environment, and finally perform specific tasks. Visual images as inputs directly influence downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the perception mechanism of embodied robots for image quality. We propose the first Embodied Preference Database (EPD), which contains 12,500 distorted image annotations. We establish assessment metrics based on the downstream tasks of robot. In addition, there is a gap between UGC and RGC. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-scale Attention Embodied Image Quality Assessment called MA-EIQA. For the proposed EPD dataset, this is the first no-reference IQA model designed for embodied robot. Finally, the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on EPD dataset is verified. The experiments demonstrate that quality assessment of embodied images is different from that of humans. We sincerely hope that the EPD can contribute to the development of embodied AI by focusing on image quality assessment. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/Jianbo-maker/EPD_benchmark.</p></details> |  |

We showcase this capability through a web interface and benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs on a dataset of 1,700 expert-annotated user-reference video pairs spanning 22 strength and mobility exercises. To accelerate research in AI-driven coaching, we release both the dataset and an automated, rubric-based evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized comparison across models. Our benchmarks reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level coaching, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in integrating nuanced, context-aware movement analysis into interactive AI systems. By framing form correction as a collaborative and creative process between humans and machines, FormCoach opens a new frontier in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Affordance-Aware Robotic Dexterous Grasping with Human-like Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08896v3)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A dexterous hand capable of generalizable grasping objects is fundamental for the development of general-purpose embodied AI. However, previous methods focus narrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordance-aware positioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation. To address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, a novel framework with two-stage training that learns a universal grasping policy with an inherent understanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage, a trajectory imitator is pre-trained on a large corpus of human hand motions to instill a strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, a residual module is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object instances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative Affordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally inappropriate contact regions, and a privileged teacher-student distillation process that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal dexterous grasping but also remains remarkably human-like in posture and functionally appropriate in contact location. As a result, AffordDex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seen objects, unseen instances, and even entirely novel categories.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Large Model Empowered Embodied AI: A Survey on Decision-Making and Embodied Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10399v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI aims to develop intelligent systems with physical forms capable of perceiving, decision-making, acting, and learning in real-world environments, providing a promising way to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite decades of explorations, it remains challenging for embodied agents to achieve human-level intelligence for general-purpose tasks in open dynamic environments. Recent breakthroughs in large models have revolutionized embodied AI by enhancing perception, interaction, planning and learning. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on large model empowered embodied AI, focusing on autonomous decision-making and embodied learning. We investigate both hierarchical and end-to-end decision-making paradigms, detailing how large models enhance high-level planning, low-level execution, and feedback for hierarchical decision-making, and how large models enhance Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end decision making. For embodied learning, we introduce mainstream learning methodologies, elaborating on how large models enhance imitation learning and reinforcement learning in-depth. For the first time, we integrate world models into the survey of embodied AI, presenting their design methods and critical roles in enhancing decision-making and learning. Though solid advances have been achieved, challenges still exist, which are discussed at the end of this survey, potentially as the further research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoSE: Skill-by-Skill Mixture-of-Experts Learning for Embodied Autonomous Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07818v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To meet the growing demand for smarter, faster, and more efficient embodied AI solutions, we introduce a novel Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) method that significantly boosts reasoning and learning efficiency for embodied autonomous systems. General MoE models demand extensive training data and complex optimization, which limits their applicability in embodied AI such as autonomous driving (AD) and robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose a skill-oriented MoE called MoSE, which mimics the human learning and reasoning process skill-by-skill, step-by-step. We introduce a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the necessary competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks, thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. To better align with multi-step planning in human reasoning and in end-to-end driving models, we build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the model to think step-by-step. Unlike other multi-round dialogues, MoSE integrates valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g. perception-prediction-planning for AD, and high-level and low-level planning for robots) in one single forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model effectively grows more diverse expertise and outperforms models on both AD corner-case reasoning tasks and robot reasoning tasks with less than 40% of the parameters.</p></details> |  |

We also provide a rich variety of playable entities, including humans, animals, robots, and vehicles for embodied AI research. We extend UnrealCV with optimized APIs and tools for data collection, environment augmentation, distributed training, and benchmarking. These improvements achieve significant improvements in the efficiency of rendering and communication, enabling advanced applications such as multi-agent interactions. Our experimental evaluation across visual navigation and tracking tasks reveals two key insights: 1) environmental diversity provides substantial benefits for developing generalizable reinforcement learning (RL) agents, and 2) current embodied agents face persistent challenges in open-world scenarios, including navigation in unstructured terrain, adaptation to unseen morphologies, and managing latency in the close-loop control systems for interacting in highly dynamic objects. UnrealZoo thus serves as both a comprehensive testing ground and a pathway toward developing more capable embodied AI systems for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlight), Project page: http://unrealzoo.site/</p></details> |

Generating synthetic images that closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins, facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using images generated by DiffPhysCam.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 17 figures, and 4 tables</p></details> |

A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |

This task requires the model to identify newly described objects that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view, posing a significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF. Our analysis reveals that 3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key challenges for R3DGS. To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language expressions in a spatially aware paradigm. ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the newly proposed R3DGS task and 3D open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks.

Among many skills that the agents need to possess, building and maintaining a semantic map of the environment is most crucial in long-horizon tasks. A semantic map captures information about the environment in a structured way, allowing the agent to reference it for advanced reasoning throughout the task. While existing surveys in embodied AI focus on general advancements or specific tasks like navigation and manipulation, this paper provides a comprehensive review of semantic map-building approaches in embodied AI, specifically for indoor navigation. We categorize these approaches based on their structural representation (spatial grids, topological graphs, dense point-clouds or hybrid maps) and the type of information they encode (implicit features or explicit environmental data). We also explore the strengths and limitations of the map building techniques, highlight current challenges, and propose future research directions. We identify that the field is moving towards developing open-vocabulary, queryable, task-agnostic map representations, while high memory demands and computational inefficiency still remaining to be open challenges. This survey aims to guide current and future researchers in advancing semantic mapping techniques for embodied AI systems.</p></details> |  |

As robotics and automated systems scale, efficient data-sharing frameworks and robust algorithms become critical. We explore the pivotal role of data handling in next-gen networks, focusing on dynamics between application and network providers (AP/NP) in DT ecosystems. We introduce PANAMA, a novel algorithm with Priority Asymmetry for Network Aware Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based multi-agent path finding (MAPF). By adopting a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) framework and asynchronous actor-learner architectures, PANAMA accelerates training while enabling autonomous task execution by embodied AI. Our approach demonstrates superior pathfinding performance in accuracy, speed, and scalability compared to existing benchmarks. Through simulations, we highlight optimized data-sharing strategies for scalable, automated systems, ensuring resilience in complex, real-world environments. PANAMA bridges the gap between network-aware decision-making and robust multi-agent coordination, advancing the synergy between DTs, wireless networks, and AI-driven automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safety of Embodied Navigation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05855v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance and gain influence, the development of embodied AI has accelerated, drawing significant attention, particularly in navigation scenarios. Embodied navigation requires an agent to perceive, interact with, and adapt to its environment while moving toward a specified target in unfamiliar settings. However, the integration of embodied navigation into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns. Given their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments, ensuring the safety of such systems is critical. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of safety in embodied navigation from multiple perspectives, encompassing attack strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation methodologies. Beyond conducting a comprehensive examination of existing safety challenges, mitigation technologies, and various datasets and metrics that assess effectiveness and robustness, we explore unresolved issues and future research directions in embodied navigation safety. These include potential attack methods, mitigation strategies, more reliable evaluation techniques, and the implementation of verification frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, this survey aims to provide valuable insights that can guide future research toward the development of safer and more reliable embodied navigation systems. Furthermore, the findings of this study have broader implications for enhancing societal safety and increasing industrial efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniEAR: Benchmarking Agent Reasoning in Embodied Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05614v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to 56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically (0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zju-real.github.io/OmniEmbodied Code: https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/OmniEmbodied</p></details> |

In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentSense: Virtual Sensor Data Generation Using LLM Agents in Simulated Home Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11773v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge in developing robust and generalizable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems for smart homes is the lack of large and diverse labeled datasets. Variations in home layouts, sensor configurations, and individual behaviors further exacerbate this issue. To address this, we leverage the idea of embodied AI agents-virtual agents that perceive and act within simulated environments guided by internal world models. We introduce AgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline in which agents live out daily routines in simulated smart homes, with behavior guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM generates diverse synthetic personas and realistic routines grounded in the environment, which are then decomposed into fine-grained actions. These actions are executed in an extended version of the VirtualHome simulator, which we augment with virtual ambient sensors that record the agents' activities. Our approach produces rich, privacy-preserving sensor data that reflects real-world diversity. We evaluate AgentSense on five real HAR datasets. Models pretrained on the generated data consistently outperform baselines, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore, combining the generated virtual sensor data with a small amount of real data achieves performance comparable to training on full real-world datasets. These results highlight the potential of using LLM-guided embodied agents for scalable and cost-effective sensor data generation in HAR.</p></details> |  |
| **[IS-Bench: Evaluating Interactive Safety of VLM-Driven Embodied Agents in Daily Household Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16402v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flawed planning from VLM-driven embodied agents poses significant safety hazards, hindering their deployment in real-world household tasks. However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.

These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI, which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally, existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes (e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints. We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D spatial intelligence.

| **[Exploring 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning: From Implicit Human Intentions to Route-Aware Activity Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12974v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D task planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advances in multimodal learning. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal 3D Reasoning Segmentation with Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13927v4)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.</p></details> |  |

However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the RoboTron-Craft, a stage-divided and cost-effective pipeline for realistic manipulation generation. Base on this, the RoboTron-Platter method is introduced, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.

| **[Object Affordance Recognition and Grounding via Multi-scale Cross-modal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01184v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification). Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance grounding and classification.</p></details> |  |

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising various rendering engines, a versatile toolchain, and a large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we integrate diverse rendering engines and advanced techniques for environment simulation, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of our environments. Secondly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for aerial VLN data collection, streamlining point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Thirdly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. Moreover, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model emphasizing key observations during flight. For benchmarking, extensive experiments and analyses are conducted, evaluating several recent VLN methods and showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and agent.

We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open physical-world embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Robots with soft bodies are examples of such physical systems, and their nonlinear body-environment dynamics can be used to compute and generate the motor signals necessary for the control of their own behavior. In this simulation study, we extend this approach to control and embed not only one but also multiple behaviors into a type of soft robot called a tensegrity robot. The resulting system, consisting of the robot and the environment, is a multistable dynamical system that converges to different attractors from varying initial conditions. Furthermore, attractor analysis reveals that there exist "untrained attractors" in the state space of the system outside the training data. These untrained attractors reflect the intrinsic properties and structures of the tensegrity robot and its interactions with the environment. The impacts of these recent findings in PRC remain unexplored in embodied AI research.

| **[MazeEval: A Benchmark for Testing Sequential Decision-Making in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20395v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment. Despite advances in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$, other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100% of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English, suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable navigation across linguistic contexts.</p></details> |  |

While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive, expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types, combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation) generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive humanoid motion generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://rosielab.github.io/compas3d</p></details> |
| **[Advances in 4D Generation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14501v3)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative artificial intelligence has recently progressed from static image and video synthesis to 3D content generation, culminating in the emergence of 4D generation-the task of synthesizing temporally coherent dynamic 3D assets guided by user input. As a burgeoning research frontier, 4D generation enables richer interactive and immersive experiences, with applications ranging from digital humans to autonomous driving. Despite rapid progress, the field lacks a unified understanding of 4D representations, generative frameworks, basic paradigms, and the core technical challenges it faces. This survey provides a systematic and in-depth review of the 4D generation landscape. To comprehensively characterize 4D generation, we first categorize fundamental 4D representations and outline associated techniques for 4D generation. We then present an in-depth analysis of representative generative pipelines based on conditions and representation methods. Subsequently, we discuss how motion and geometry priors are integrated into 4D outputs to ensure spatio-temporal consistency under various control schemes. From an application perspective, this paper summarizes 4D generation tasks in areas such as dynamic object/scene generation, digital human synthesis, editable 4D content, and embodied AI. Furthermore, we summarize and multi-dimensionally compare four basic paradigms for 4D generation: End-to-End, Generated-Data-Based, Implicit-Distillation-Based, and Explicit-Supervision-Based. Concluding our analysis, we highlight five key challenges-consistency, controllability, diversity, efficiency, and fidelity-and contextualize these with current approaches.By distilling recent advances and outlining open problems, this work offers a comprehensive and forward-looking perspective to guide future research in 4D generation.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jasper0314-huang.github.io/thinkact-vla/</p></details> |
| **[Towards provable probabilistic safety for scalable embodied AI systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05171v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable embodied AI systems. Instead, empirical safety evaluation is employed as an alternative, but the absence of provable guarantees imposes significant limitations. To address these issues, we argue for a paradigm shift to provable probabilistic safety that integrates provable guarantees with progressive achievement toward a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance. The new paradigm better leverages statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability, and a well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be deployed at scale. In this Perspective, we outline a roadmap for provable probabilistic safety, along with corresponding challenges and potential solutions. By bridging the gap between theoretical safety assurance and practical deployment, this Perspective offers a pathway toward safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical applications.</p></details> |  |

Unlike offline video understanding, streaming video understanding requires the ability to process video streams frame by frame, preserve historical information, and make low-latency decisions. To address these challenges, our main contributions are three-fold. (i) We develop a novel streaming video backbone, termed as StreamFormer, by incorporating causal temporal attention into a pre-trained vision transformer. This enables efficient streaming video processing while maintaining image representation capability. (ii) To train StreamFormer, we propose to unify diverse spatial-temporal video understanding tasks within a multitask visual-language alignment framework. Hence, StreamFormer learns global semantics, temporal dynamics, and fine-grained spatial relationships simultaneously. (iii) We conduct extensive experiments on online action detection, online video instance segmentation, and video question answering. StreamFormer achieves competitive results while maintaining efficiency, demonstrating its potential for real-time applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

PR2 offers high-quality scene rendering and robot dynamic simulation, enabling (i) the creation of diverse scenes using various digital assets, (ii) the integration of advanced perception or foundation models, and (iii) the implementation of planning and control algorithms for dynamic humanoid robot behaviors based on environmental feedback. The beta version of PR2 has been deployed for the simulation track of a nationwide full-size humanoid robot competition for college students, attracting 137 teams and over 400 participants within four months. This competition covered traditional tasks in bipedal walking, as well as novel challenges in loco-manipulation and language-instruction-based object search, marking a first for public college robotics competitions. A retrospective analysis of the competition suggests that future events should emphasize the integration of locomotion with manipulation and perception. By making the PR2 testbed publicly available at https://github.com/pr2-humanoid/PR2-Platform, we aim to further advance education and training in humanoid robotics.

As they serve as the primary visual input for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient is therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, but their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video inputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person videos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints inherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a training-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning. EgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR for temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering (PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and removes redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token selector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame diversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune consistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning ratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover, we deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB edge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for on-device egomotion video reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Existing 3D generation primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models, the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we propose \textbf{PhysX-3D}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material, affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models, which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2) Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to facilitate future research in generative physical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://physx-3d.github.io/</p></details> |

Although recent progress in Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based agents has demonstrated promising perception and decision-making abilities through prompting, none has yet established a fully modular world model design that reduces risky and costly interactions with the environment by predicting the future state of the world. We introduce WMNav, a novel World Model-based Navigation framework powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). It predicts possible outcomes of decisions and builds memories to provide feedback to the policy module. To retain the predicted state of the environment, WMNav proposes the online maintained Curiosity Value Map as part of the world model memory to provide dynamic configuration for navigation policy. By decomposing according to a human-like thinking process, WMNav effectively alleviates the impact of model hallucination by making decisions based on the feedback difference between the world model plan and observation. To further boost efficiency, we implement a two-stage action proposer strategy: broad exploration followed by precise localization. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and MP3D validates WMNav surpasses existing zero-shot benchmarks in both success rate and exploration efficiency (absolute improvement: +3.2% SR and +3.2% SPL on HM3D, +13.5% SR and +1.1% SPL on MP3D).

As a result, we are seeing similar advancements in embodied AI and robotics for control policy generation. Our review paper examines the integration of generative AI models with RL to advance robotics. Our primary focus is on the duality between generative AI and RL for robotics downstream tasks. Specifically, we investigate: (1) The role of prominent generative AI tools as modular priors for multi-modal input fusion in RL tasks. (2) How RL can train, fine-tune and distill generative models for policy generation, such as VLA models, similarly to RL applications in large language models. We then propose a new taxonomy based on a considerable amount of selected papers. Lastly, we identify open challenges accounting for model scalability, adaptation and grounding, giving recommendations and insights on future research directions. We reflect on which generative AI models best fit the RL tasks and why. On the other side, we reflect on important issues inherent to RL-enhanced generative policies, such as safety concerns and failure modes, and what are the limitations of current methods.

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

Given a human motion within a 3D scene, HIS-QA requires the agent to comprehend human states and behaviors, reason about its surrounding environment, and answer human-related questions within the scene. To support this new task, we present HIS-Bench, a multimodal benchmark that systematically evaluates HIS understanding across a broad spectrum, from basic perception to commonsense reasoning and planning. Our evaluation of various vision-language models on HIS-Bench reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle HIS-QA tasks. To this end, we propose HIS-GPT, the first foundation model for HIS understanding. HIS-GPT integrates 3D scene context and human motion dynamics into large language models while incorporating specialized mechanisms to capture human-scene interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIS-GPT sets a new state-of-the-art on HIS-QA tasks. We hope this work inspires future research on human behavior analysis in 3D scenes, advancing embodied AI and world models.

However, most navigation policies are sensitive to viewpoint changes, i.e., variations in camera height and viewing angle that alter the agent's observation. In this paper, we introduce a generalized scenario, V2-VLNCE (VLNCE with Varied Viewpoints), and propose VIL (View Invariant Learning), a view-invariant post-training strategy that enhances the robustness of existing navigation policies to changes in camera viewpoint. VIL employs a contrastive learning framework to learn sparse and view-invariant features. Additionally, we introduce a teacher-student framework for the Waypoint Predictor Module, a core component of most VLNCE baselines, where a view-dependent teacher model distills knowledge into a view-invariant student model. We employ an end-to-end training paradigm to jointly optimize these components, thus eliminating the cost for individual module training. Empirical results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on V2-VLNCE by 8-15% measured on Success Rate for two standard benchmark datasets R2R-CE and RxR-CE. Furthermore, we evaluate VIL under the standard VLNCE setting and find that, despite being trained for varied viewpoints, it often still improves performance. On the more challenging RxR-CE dataset, our method also achieved state-of-the-art performance across all metrics when compared to other map-free methods. This suggests that adding VIL does not diminish the standard viewpoint performance and can serve as a plug-and-play post-training method.</p></details> | Under review |

However, expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects, and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training. Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively activates more neuron values in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

While recent vision-language models (VLMs) excel at static perception tasks, they struggle with the temporal reasoning, spatial understanding, and commonsense grounding needed for planning in interactive environments. In this work, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that brings R1-style reasoning enhancement into embodied planning. We first distill a high-quality dataset from a powerful closed-source model and perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to equip the model with structured decision-making priors. We then design a rule-based reward function tailored to multi-step action quality and optimize the policy via Generalized Reinforced Preference Optimization (GRPO). Our approach is evaluated on Embench, a recent benchmark for interactive embodied tasks, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms models of similar or larger scale, including GPT-4o-mini and 70B+ open-source baselines, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen environments. This work highlights the potential of reinforcement-driven reasoning to advance long-horizon planning in embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Long-term Point Tracking in the Foundation Model Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09217v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point tracking aims to identify the same physical point across video frames and serves as a geometry-aware representation of motion. This representation supports a wide range of applications, from robotics to augmented reality, by enabling accurate modeling of dynamic environments. Most existing long-term tracking approaches operate in an offline setting, where future frames are available to refine predictions and recover from occlusions. However, real-world scenarios often demand online predictions: the model must operate causally, using only current and past frames. This constraint is critical in streaming video and embodied AI, where decisions must be made immediately based on past observations. Under such constraints, viewpoint invariance becomes essential. Visual foundation models, trained on diverse large-scale datasets, offer the potential for robust geometric representations. While they lack temporal reasoning on their own, they can be integrated into tracking pipelines to enrich spatial features. In this thesis, we address the problem of long-term point tracking in an online setting, where frames are processed sequentially without access to future information or sliding windows. We begin by evaluating the suitability of visual foundation models for this task and find that they can serve as useful initializations and be integrated into tracking pipelines. However, to enable long-term tracking in an online setting, a dedicated design is still required. In particular, maintaining coherence over time in this causal regime requires memory to propagate appearance and context across frames. To address this, we introduce Track-On, a transformer-based model that treats each tracked point as a query and processes video frames one at a time. Track-On sets a new state of the art across seven public benchmarks, demonstrating the feasibility of long-term tracking without future access.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2501.18487</p></details> |

To tackle these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models.

Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research. Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite. S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic planning.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, we will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field.

However, most existing target person tracking (TPT) benchmarks are limited to controlled laboratory environments with few distractions, clean backgrounds, and short-term occlusions. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset designed for TPT in crowded and unstructured environments, demonstrated through a robot-person following task. The dataset is collected by a human pushing a sensor-equipped cart while following a target person, capturing human-like following behavior and emphasizing long-term tracking challenges, including frequent occlusions and the need for re-identification from numerous pedestrians. It includes multi-modal data streams, including odometry, 3D LiDAR, IMU, panoramic images, and RGB-D images, along with exhaustively annotated 2D bounding boxes of the target person across 48 sequences, both indoors and outdoors. Using this dataset and visual annotations, we perform extensive experiments with existing SOTA TPT methods, offering a thorough analysis of their limitations and suggesting future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. web: https://medlartea.github.io/tpt-bench/</p></details> |
| **[A Neural Representation Framework with LLM-Driven Spatial Reasoning for Open-Vocabulary 3D Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06719v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical feature field. This field represents language and instance features using distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations, outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their spatial reasoning capability.</p></details> |  |

Current image-to-3D methods primarily focus on surface geometry and texture, neglecting part decomposition and articulation modeling. Meanwhile, neural reconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense multi-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we introduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, interactable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a three-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D object meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D segmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video diffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable part masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by occlusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by a dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to ensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated objects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and plausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated asset generation.

With PAPRLE, a user can change the arrangement of the robotic limbs, and control them using a variety of input devices, including puppeteers, gaming controllers, and VR-based interfaces. This versatility supports a wide range of teleoperation scenarios and promotes adaptability to different task requirements. To further enhance configurability, we introduce a pluggable puppeteer device that can be easily mounted and adapted to match the target robot configurations. PAPRLE supports bilateral teleoperation through these puppeteer devices, agnostic to the type or configuration of the follower robot. By supporting both joint-space and task-space control, the system provides real-time force feedback, improving user fidelity and physical interaction awareness. The modular design of PAPRLE facilitates novel spatial arrangements of the limbs and enables scalable data collection, thereby advancing research in embodied AI and learning-based control. We validate PAPRLE in various real-world settings, demonstrating its versatility across diverse combinations of leader devices and follower robots. The system will be released as open source, including both hardware and software components, to support broader adoption and community-driven extension.

Such models are useful for embodied AI and scene retrieval applications, which involve searching for objects or patterns using natural language descriptions. While recent works have focused on LLM-based scaling of 3DVG datasets, these datasets do not capture the full range of potential prompts which could be specified in the English language. To ensure that we are scaling up and testing against a useful and representative set of prompts, we propose a framework for linguistically analyzing 3DVG prompts and introduce Visual Grounding with Diverse Language in 3D (ViGiL3D), a diagnostic dataset for evaluating visual grounding methods against a diverse set of language patterns. We evaluate existing open-vocabulary 3DVG methods to demonstrate that these methods are not yet proficient in understanding and identifying the targets of more challenging, out-of-distribution prompts, toward real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages with 8 figures and 14 tables; updated for ACL 2025 camera-ready with additional discussion and figures</p></details> |

However, collecting such embodied data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner, a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap. It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74% compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by 89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning.

These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices, and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings, which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents, allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-free Generation of Temporally Consistent Rewards from VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04789v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in embodied tasks such as goal decomposition and visual comprehension. However, providing accurate rewards for robotic manipulation without fine-tuning VLMs remains challenging due to the absence of domain-specific robotic knowledge in pre-trained datasets and high computational costs that hinder real-time applicability. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM, a novel training-free, temporally consistent framework that generates accurate rewards through tracking the status changes in VLM-derived subgoals. Specifically, our method first queries the VLM to establish spatially aware subgoals and an initial completion estimate before each round of interaction. We then employ a Bayesian tracking algorithm to update the goal completion status dynamically, using subgoal hidden states to generate structured rewards for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. This approach enhances long-horizon decision-making and improves failure recovery capabilities with RL. Extensive experiments indicate that $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in two robot manipulation benchmarks, demonstrating superior reward accuracy with reduced computation consumption. We believe our approach not only advances reward generation techniques but also contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website: https://t2-vlm.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimLauncher: Launching Sample-Efficient Real-world Robotic Reinforcement Learning via Simulation Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04452v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous learning of dexterous, long-horizon robotic skills has been a longstanding pursuit of embodied AI. Recent advances in robotic reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable performance and robustness in real-world visuomotor control tasks. However, applying RL in the real world faces challenges such as low sample efficiency, slow exploration, and significant reliance on human intervention. In contrast, simulators offer a safe and efficient environment for extensive exploration and data collection, while the visual sim-to-real gap, often a limiting factor, can be mitigated using real-to-sim techniques. Building on these, we propose SimLauncher, a novel framework that combines the strengths of real-world RL and real-to-sim-to-real approaches to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we first pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment, which then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values using extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived from pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from the pre-trained policy for better exploration. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multi-stage, contact-rich, and dexterous hand manipulation tasks. Compared to prior real-world RL approaches, SimLauncher significantly improves sample efficiency and achieves near-perfect success rates. We hope this work serves as a proof of concept and inspires further research on leveraging large-scale simulation pre-training to benefit real-world robotic RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic 3D Scene Generation with Spatially Contextualized VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20129v3)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints. Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.

We propose turning exploration into supervision through Compute as Teacher (CaT), which converts the model's own exploration at inference-time into reference-free supervision by synthesizing a single reference from a group of parallel rollouts and then optimizing toward it. Concretely, the current policy produces a group of rollouts; a frozen anchor (the initial policy) reconciles omissions and contradictions to estimate a reference, turning extra inference-time compute into a teacher signal. We turn this into rewards in two regimes: (i) verifiable tasks use programmatic equivalence on final answers; (ii) non-verifiable tasks use self-proposed rubrics-binary, auditable criteria scored by an independent LLM judge, with reward given by the fraction satisfied. Unlike selection methods (best-of-N, majority, perplexity, or judge scores), synthesis may disagree with the majority and be correct even when all rollouts are wrong; performance scales with the number of rollouts. As a test-time procedure, CaT improves Gemma 3 4B, Qwen 3 4B, and Llama 3.1 8B (up to +27% on MATH-500; +12% on HealthBench). With reinforcement learning (CaT-RL), we obtain further gains (up to +33% and +30%), with the trained policy surpassing the initial teacher signal.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Yet, existing theory remains largely confined to Hilbert spaces, relying on inner-product frameworks and orthogonality. This paradigm fails to capture non-Euclidean settings, such as mirror descent on simplices, Bregman proximal methods for sparse learning, natural gradient descent in information geometry, or Kullback--Leibler-regularized language model training. Unlike Euclidean-based Hilbert-space methods, this approach embraces general Banach spaces. This work introduces a pioneering Banach--Bregman framework for stochastic iterations, establishing Bregman geometry as a foundation for next-generation optimization. It (i) provides a unified template via Bregman projections and Bregman--Fejer monotonicity, encompassing stochastic approximation, mirror descent, natural gradient, adaptive methods, and mirror-prox; (ii) establishes super-relaxations ($\lambda > 2$) in non-Hilbert settings, enabling flexible geometries and elucidating their acceleration effect; and (iii) delivers convergence theorems spanning almost-sure boundedness to geometric rates, validated on synthetic and real-world tasks. Empirical studies across machine learning (UCI benchmarks), deep learning (e.g., Transformer training), reinforcement learning (actor--critic), and large language models (WikiText-2 with distilGPT-2) show up to 20% faster convergence, reduced variance, and enhanced accuracy over classical baselines. These results position Banach--Bregman geometry as a cornerstone unifying optimization theory and practice across core AI paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>69 pa...</summary><p>69 pages, 10 figures.

However, training Web Agents with reinforcement learning faces critical challenges including credit assignment misallocation, prohibitively high annotation costs, and reward sparsity. To address these issues, we propose Tree-Guided Preference Optimization (TGPO), an offline reinforcement learning framework that proposes a tree-structured trajectory representation merging semantically identical states across trajectories to eliminate label conflicts. Our framework incorporates a Process Reward Model that automatically generates fine-grained rewards through subgoal progress, redundancy detection, and action verification. Additionally, a dynamic weighting mechanism prioritizes high-impact decision points during training. Experiments on Online-Mind2Web and our self-constructed C-WebShop datasets demonstrate that TGPO significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving higher success rates with fewer redundant steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Reinforcement Learning-Guided Diffusion Model for Image Synthesis via Hybrid Quantum-Classical Generative Model Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14163v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models typically employ static or heuristic classifier-free guidance (CFG) schedules, which often fail to adapt across timesteps and noise conditions. In this work, we introduce a quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) controller that dynamically adjusts CFG at each denoising step. The controller adopts a hybrid quantum--classical actor--critic architecture: a shallow variational quantum circuit (VQC) with ring entanglement generates policy features, which are mapped by a compact multilayer perceptron (MLP) into Gaussian actions over $\Delta$CFG, while a classical critic estimates value functions. The policy is optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), guided by a reward that balances classification confidence, perceptual improvement, and action regularization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that our QRL policy improves perceptual quality (LPIPS, PSNR, SSIM) while reducing parameter count compared to classical RL actors and fixed schedules. Ablation studies on qubit number and circuit depth reveal trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, and extended evaluations confirm robust generation under long diffusion schedules.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRDT3: Diffusion-Refined Decision Test-Time Training Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06718v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision Transformer (DT), a trajectory modelling method, has shown competitive performance compared to traditional offline reinforcement learning (RL) approaches on various classic control tasks. However, it struggles to learn optimal policies from suboptimal, reward-labelled trajectories. In this study, we explore the use of conditional generative modelling to facilitate trajectory stitching given its high-quality data generation ability. Additionally, recent advancements in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have shown their linear complexity and competitive sequence modelling performance over Transformers. We leverage the Test-Time Training (TTT) layer, an RNN that updates hidden states during testing, to model trajectories in the form of DT. We introduce a unified framework, called Diffusion-Refined Decision TTT (DRDT3), to achieve performance beyond DT models. Specifically, we propose the Decision TTT (DT3) module, which harnesses the sequence modelling strengths of both self-attention and the TTT layer to capture recent contextual information and make coarse action predictions. DRDT3 iteratively refines the coarse action predictions through the generative diffusion model, progressively moving closer to the optimal actions. We further integrate DT3 with the diffusion model using a unified optimization objective. With experiments on multiple tasks in the D4RL benchmark, our DT3 model without diffusion refinement demonstrates improved performance over standard DT, while DRDT3 further achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art DT-based and offline RL methods.</p></details> |  |

However, multi-UAV coordination under disturbances, nonlinear payload dynamics, and slack--taut cable modes remains a challenging control problem. To our knowledge, no prior work has addressed these cable mode transitions in the multi-UAV context, instead relying on simplifying rigid-link assumptions. We propose CrazyMARL, a decentralized Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for multi-UAV cable-suspended payload transport. Simulation results demonstrate that the learned policies can outperform classical decentralized controllers in terms of disturbance rejection and tracking precision, achieving an 80% recovery rate from harsh conditions compared to 44% for the baseline method. We also achieve successful zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and demonstrate that our policies are highly robust under harsh conditions, including wind, random external disturbances, and transitions between slack and taut cable dynamics. This work paves the way for autonomous, resilient UAV teams capable of executing complex payload missions in unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Online Bayesian Risk-Averse Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14077v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the Bayesian risk-averse formulation in reinforcement learning (RL). To address the epistemic uncertainty due to a lack of data, we adopt the Bayesian Risk Markov Decision Process (BRMDP) to account for the parameter uncertainty of the unknown underlying model. We derive the asymptotic normality that characterizes the difference between the Bayesian risk value function and the original value function under the true unknown distribution. The results indicate that the Bayesian risk-averse approach tends to pessimistically underestimate the original value function. This discrepancy increases with stronger risk aversion and decreases as more data become available. We then utilize this adaptive property in the setting of online RL as well as online contextual multi-arm bandits (CMAB), a special case of online RL. We provide two procedures using posterior sampling for both the general RL problem and the CMAB problem. We establish a sub-linear regret bound, with the regret defined as the conventional regret for both the RL and CMAB settings. Additionally, we establish a sub-linear regret bound for the CMAB setting with the regret defined as the Bayesian risk regret. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in addressing epistemic uncertainty and verifying the theoretical properties.</p></details> |  |

Supervised learning (SL)-based solvers require large amounts of high-quality labeled data, while reinforcement learning (RL)-based solvers, though less dependent on such data, often suffer from inefficiencies. To address these limitations, we propose LocalEscaper, a novel weakly-supervised learning framework for large-scale TSP. LocalEscaper effectively combines the advantages of both SL and RL, enabling effective training on datasets with low-quality labels. To further enhance solution quality, we introduce a regional reconstruction strategy, which is the key technique of this paper and mitigates the local-optima problem common in existing local reconstruction methods. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that LocalEscaper outperforms existing neural solvers, achieving remarkable results.</p></details> |  |

Today's mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10--30Hz band by over 30x, and up to 100x in sub-bands surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future GW observatories, and more broadly instrumentation and control systems.</p></details> |  |

However, discussions on these topics have largely been overlooked in semantic communication (SemCom), which focuses on transmitting meaning rather than symbols, leading to significant improvements in communication efficiency. Despite these advantages, semantic errors -- stemming from discrepancies between transmitted and received meanings -- present a major challenge to system reliability. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a comprehensive framework for detecting and correcting semantic errors in SemCom systems. We formally define semantic error, detection, and correction mechanisms, and identify key sources of semantic errors. To address these challenges, we develop a Gaussian process (GP)-based method for latent space monitoring to detect errors, alongside a human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (HITL-RL) approach to optimize semantic model configurations using user feedback. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in mitigating semantic errors under various conditions, including adversarial attacks, input feature changes, physical channel variations, and user preference shifts. This work lays the foundation for more reliable and adaptive SemCom systems with robust semantic error management techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, this paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE CSCN 2024</p></details> |

Drawing inspiration from key human learning strategies, we propose two novel strategies to enhance the capability of large language models to solve these complex problems. First, Adaptive Difficulty Curriculum Learning (ADCL) is a novel curriculum learning strategy that tackles the Difficulty Shift phenomenon (i.e., a model's perception of problem difficulty dynamically changes during training) by periodically re-estimating difficulty within upcoming data batches to maintain alignment with the model's evolving capabilities. Second, Expert-Guided Self-Reformulation (EGSR) is a novel reinforcement learning strategy that bridges the gap between imitation learning and pure exploration by guiding models to reformulate expert solutions within their own conceptual framework, rather than relying on direct imitation, fostering deeper understanding and knowledge assimilation. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, using Qwen2.5-7B as the base model, demonstrate that these human-inspired strategies synergistically and significantly enhance performance. Notably, their combined application improves performance over the standard Zero-RL baseline by 10% on the AIME24 benchmark and 16.6% on AIME25.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figs |

However, unstructured environments and dynamic interactions pose significant challenges to autonomous parking tasks. To address this problem, we propose SEG-Parking, a novel end-to-end offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework to achieve interaction-aware autonomous parking. Notably, a specialized parking dataset is constructed for parking scenarios, which include those without interference from the opposite vehicle (OV) and complex ones involving interactions with the OV. Based on this dataset, a goal-conditioned state encoder is pretrained to map the fused perception information into the latent space. Then, an offline RL policy is optimized with a conservative regularizer that penalizes out-of-distribution actions. Extensive closed-loop experiments are conducted in the high-fidelity CARLA simulator. Comparative results demonstrate the superior performance of our framework with the highest success rate and robust generalization to out-of-distribution parking scenarios. The related dataset and source code will be made publicly available after the paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |

Current robotic systems struggle to meet these demands. Manual programming is brittle and costly to adapt, while learning-based methods suffer from poor sample efficiency and unsafe exploration in contact-rich tasks. To address this, we present SHaRe-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages multiple sources of prior knowledge. By (i) structuring skills into manipulation primitives, (ii) incorporating human demonstrations and online corrections, and (iii) bounding interaction forces with per-axis compliance, SHaRe-RL enables efficient and safe online learning for long-horizon, contact-rich industrial assembly tasks.

This project develops a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to enable a single UAV to autonomously navigate between predefined points without manual intervention. The drone learns navigation policies through trial-and-error interaction, using a custom reward function that encourages goal-reaching efficiency while penalizing collisions and unsafe behavior. The control system integrates ROS with a Gym-compatible training environment, enabling flexible deployment and testing. After training, the learned policy is deployed on a real UAV platform and evaluated under practical conditions. Results show that the UAV can successfully perform autonomous navigation with minimal human oversight, demonstrating the viability of RL-based control for point-to-point drone operations in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Symposium at the Translational AI Centre in Iowa State University</p></details> |
| **[Agile Temporal Discretization for Symbolic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03741v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As control systems grow in complexity, abstraction-based methods have become essential for designing controllers with formal guarantees. However, a key limitation of these methods is their reliance on discrete-time models, typically obtained by discretizing continuous-time systems with a fixed timestep. This discretization leads to two major problems: when the timestep is small, the abstraction includes numerous stuttering and spurious trajectories, making controller synthesis suboptimal or even infeasible; conversely, a large time step may also render control design infeasible due to a lack of flexibility. In this work, drawing inspiration from Reinforcement Learning concepts, we introduce temporal abstractions, which allow for a flexible timestep. We provide a method for constructing such abstractions and formally establish their correctness in controller design. Furthermore we show how to apply these to optimal control under reachability specifications. Finally we showcase our methods on two numerical examples, highlighting that our approach leads to controllers that achieve a lower worst-case control cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model-Empowered Decision Transformer for UAV-Enabled Data Collection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13934v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for reliable and energy-efficient data collection from spatially distributed devices holds great promise in supporting diverse Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Nevertheless, the limited endurance and communication range of UAVs necessitate intelligent trajectory planning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been extensively explored for UAV trajectory optimization, its interactive nature entails high costs and risks in real-world environments. Offline RL mitigates these issues but remains susceptible to unstable training and heavily rely on expert-quality datasets. To address these challenges, we formulate a joint UAV trajectory planning and resource allocation problem to maximize energy efficiency of data collection. The resource allocation subproblem is first transformed into an equivalent linear programming formulation and solved optimally with polynomial-time complexity. Then, we propose a large language model (LLM)-empowered critic-regularized decision transformer (DT) framework, termed LLM-CRDT, to learn effective UAV control policies. In LLM-CRDT, we incorporate critic networks to regularize the DT model training, thereby integrating the sequence modeling capabilities of DT with critic-based value guidance to enable learning effective policies from suboptimal datasets. Furthermore, to mitigate the data-hungry nature of transformer models, we employ a pre-trained LLM as the transformer backbone of the DT model and adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, i.e., LoRA, enabling rapid adaptation to UAV control tasks with small-scale dataset and low computational overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that LLM-CRDT outperforms benchmark online and offline RL methods, achieving up to 36.7\% higher energy efficiency than the current state-of-the-art DT approaches.</p></details> | 14pages, 8 figures |

While prior research has explored what makes educational texts interesting, still little is known about the linguistic features that drive engagement in conversations. To address this gap, we introduce IntrEx, the first large dataset annotated for interestingness and expected interestingness in teacher-student interactions. Built upon the Teacher-Student Chatroom Corpus (TSCC), IntrEx extends prior work by incorporating sequence-level annotations, allowing for the study of engagement beyond isolated turns to capture how interest evolves over extended dialogues. We employ a rigorous annotation process with over 100 second-language learners, using a comparison-based rating approach inspired by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to improve agreement. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can predict human interestingness judgments. We find that LLMs (7B/8B parameters) fine-tuned on interestingness ratings outperform larger proprietary models like GPT-4o, demonstrating the potential for specialised datasets to model engagement in educational settings. Finally, we analyze how linguistic and cognitive factors, such as concreteness, comprehensibility (readability), and uptake, influence engagement in educational dialogues.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Findings camera-ready, 9+7 pages</p></details> |
| **[Posterior-GRPO: Rewarding Reasoning Processes in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05170v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced code generation for large language models (LLMs). However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based rewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning process. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising direction, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model learns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes. To address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively incorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable reasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference pairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score reasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method for reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs by systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along curated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical rigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other benchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method that conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying rewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO effectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning with final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior performance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only baselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to mathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available.</p></details> |  |

A human-like form factor further enables the use of vast datasets of human-hand interactions. However, the primary bottleneck in dexterous manipulation lies not only in software but arguably even more in hardware. Robotic hands that approach human capabilities are often prohibitively expensive, bulky, or require enterprise-level maintenance, limiting their accessibility for broader research and practical applications. What if the research community could get started with reliable dexterous hands within a day? We present the open-source ORCA hand, a reliable and anthropomorphic 17-DoF tendon-driven robotic hand with integrated tactile sensors, fully assembled in less than eight hours and built for a material cost below 2,000 CHF. We showcase ORCA's key design features such as popping joints, auto-calibration, and tensioning systems that significantly reduce complexity while increasing reliability, accuracy, and robustness. We benchmark the ORCA hand across a variety of tasks, ranging from teleoperation and imitation learning to zero-shot sim-to-real reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate its durability, withstanding more than 10,000 continuous operation cycles - equivalent to approximately 20 hours - without hardware failure, the only constraint being the duration of the experiment itself.

| **[Agile in the Face of Delay: Asynchronous End-to-End Learning for Real-World Aerial Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13816v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust autonomous navigation for Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (AAVs) in complex environments is a critical capability. However, modern end-to-end navigation faces a key challenge: the high-frequency control loop needed for agile flight conflicts with low-frequency perception streams, which are limited by sensor update rates and significant computational cost. This mismatch forces conventional synchronous models into undesirably low control rates. To resolve this, we propose an asynchronous reinforcement learning framework that decouples perception and control, enabling a high-frequency policy to act on the latest IMU state for immediate reactivity, while incorporating perception features asynchronously. To manage the resulting data staleness, we introduce a theoretically-grounded Temporal Encoding Module (TEM) that explicitly conditions the policy on perception delays, a strategy complemented by a two-stage curriculum to ensure stable and efficient training. Validated in extensive simulations, our method was successfully deployed in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on an onboard NUC, where it sustains a 100~Hz control rate and demonstrates robust, agile navigation in cluttered real-world environments. Our source code will be released for community reference.</p></details> |  |

We also test if we can accelerate the novelty-based training of these larger models by seeding the training with a pretrained models. The experimental results were mixed. NS-ES showed progress, but it would clearly need many more iterations for it to yield interesting agents. NSR-ES, on the other hand, proved quite capable of being straightforwardly used on larger models, since its performance appears as similar between the feed-forward model and Decision Transformer, as it was for the OpenAI-ES in our previous work.</p></details> |  |

While supervised fine-tuning with demonstrations is constrained by data quality, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. We propose a human-in-the-loop dual-actor fine-tuning framework grounded in RL. The framework integrates a primary actor for robust multi-task performance with a refinement actor for latent-space adaptation. Beyond standard physical interventions, we introduce a lightweight talk-and-tweak scheme that converts human corrections into semantically grounded language commands, thereby generating a new dataset for policy learning. In real-world multi-task experiments, our approach achieves 100% success across three tasks within 101 minutes of online fine-tuning. For long-horizon tasks, it sustains a 50% success rate over 12 consecutive operations. Furthermore, the framework scales effectively to multi-robot training, achieving up to a 2 times improvement in efficiency when using dual robots.

| **[AdaThinkDrive: Adaptive Thinking via Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13769v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reasoning technology like Chain of Thought (CoT) has been widely adopted in Vision Language Action (VLA) models, it demonstrates promising capabilities in end to end autonomous driving. However, recent efforts to integrate CoT reasoning often fall short in simple scenarios, introducing unnecessary computational overhead without improving decision quality. To address this, we propose AdaThinkDrive, a novel VLA framework with a dual mode reasoning mechanism inspired by fast and slow thinking. First, our framework is pretrained on large scale autonomous driving (AD) scenarios using both question answering (QA) and trajectory datasets to acquire world knowledge and driving commonsense. During supervised fine tuning (SFT), we introduce a two mode dataset, fast answering (w/o CoT) and slow thinking (with CoT), enabling the model to distinguish between scenarios that require reasoning. Furthermore, an Adaptive Think Reward strategy is proposed in conjunction with the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which rewards the model for selectively applying CoT by comparing trajectory quality across different reasoning modes. Extensive experiments on the Navsim benchmark show that AdaThinkDrive achieves a PDMS of 90.3, surpassing the best vision only baseline by 1.7 points. Moreover, ablations show that AdaThinkDrive surpasses both the never Think and always Think baselines, improving PDMS by 2.0 and 1.4, respectively. It also reduces inference time by 14% compared to the always Think baseline, demonstrating its ability to balance accuracy and efficiency through adaptive reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Instead of mainly relying on domain randomization (DR) to best cover the real environments and thereby close the sim-to-real gap and enhance robustness, this work proposes an emerging decoupled framework that acquires fast online adaptation ability and mitigates the sim-to-real problems in unfamiliar environments by isolating stance-leg control and swing-leg control. Various simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate its effectiveness against horizontal force disturbances, uneven terrains, heavy and biased payloads, and sim-to-real gap.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Insertion of Flexible Cables in Industrial Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13731v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The industrial insertion of flexible flat cables (FFCs) into receptacles presents a significant challenge owing to the need for submillimeter precision when handling the deformable cables. In manufacturing processes, FFC insertion with robotic manipulators often requires laborious human-guided trajectory generation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a solution to automate this task without modeling complex properties of FFCs, the nondeterminism caused by the deformability of FFCs requires significant efforts and time on training. Moreover, training directly in a real environment is dangerous as industrial robots move fast and possess no safety measure. We propose an RL algorithm for FFC insertion that leverages a foundation model-based real-to-sim approach to reduce the training time and eliminate the risk of physical damages to robots and surroundings. Training is done entirely in simulation, allowing for random exploration without the risk of physical damages. Sim-to-real transfer is achieved through semantic segmentation masks which leave only those visual features relevant to the insertion tasks such as the geometric and spatial information of the cables and receptacles. To enhance generality, we use a foundation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). To eleminate human intervention, we employ a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to automate the initial prompting of SAM2 to find segmentation masks. In the experiments, our method exhibits zero-shot capabilities, which enable direct deployments to real environments without fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexity of managing node connections and diverse modules can be challenging for users. In this paper, we introduce ComfyGPT, a self-optimizing multi-agent system designed to generate ComfyUI workflows based on task descriptions automatically. The key innovations of ComfyGPT include: (1) consisting of four specialized agents to build a multi-agent workflow generation system: ReformatAgent, FlowAgent, RefineAgent, and ExecuteAgent; (2) focusing on generating precise node connections instead of entire workflows, improving generation accuracy; and (3) enhancing workflow generation through reinforcement learning. Moreover, we introduce FlowDataset, a large-scale dataset containing 13,571 workflow-description pairs, and FlowBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating workflow generation systems. Additionally, we propose four novel evaluation metrics: Format Validation (FV), Pass Accuracy (PA), Pass Instruct Alignment (PIA), and Pass Node Diversity (PND). Experimental results demonstrate that ComfyGPT significantly outperforms existing LLM-based methods in workflow generation, making it a significant step forward in this field.

However, mainstream preference modeling in RM is inadequate in terms of token-level interaction, making its judgment signals vulnerable to being hacked by misallocated attention to context. This stems from two fundamental limitations: (1) Current preference modeling employs decoder-only architectures, where the unidirectional causal attention mechanism leads to forward-decaying intra-sequence attention within the prompt-response sequence. (2) The independent Siamese-encoding paradigm induces the absence of token-level inter-sequence attention between chosen and rejected sequences. To address this "attention hacking", we propose "Interaction Distillation", a novel training framework for more adequate preference modeling through attention-level optimization. The method introduces an interaction-based natural language understanding model as the teacher to provide sophisticated token interaction patterns via comprehensive attention, and guides the preference modeling to simulate teacher model's interaction pattern through an attentional alignment objective. Through extensive experiments, interaction distillation has demonstrated its ability to provide more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to state-of-the-art RM optimization methods that target data noise, highlighting the attention hacking constitute a more fundamental limitation in RM.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is not suitable for this topic, we need to adjust the context</p></details> |

LLM-I is designed to overcome the "one-tool" bottleneck of current unified models, which are limited to synthetic imagery and struggle with tasks requiring factual grounding or programmatic precision. Our framework empowers a central LLM or MLLM agent to intelligently orchestrate a diverse toolkit of specialized visual tools, including online image search, diffusion-based generation, code execution, and image editing. The agent is trained to select and apply these tools proficiently via a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that features a hybrid reward system combining rule-based logic with judgments from LLM and MLLM evaluators. Trained on a diverse new dataset using four different model backbones, LLM-I demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by a large margin across four benchmarks. We also introduce a novel test-time scaling strategy that provides further performance gains. Project Page: https://github.com/ByteDance-BandAI/LLM-I.</p></details> |  |

The established image-based world models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model (GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling potential of 3D world model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICCV 2025.

Tactile sensors often offer limited and local contact information, making it challenging to reconstruct the pose from partial data. Our approach uses sensorimotor exploration to actively control a robot hand to interact with the object. We train with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to explore and collect tactile data. The collected 3D point clouds are used to iteratively refine the object's shape and pose. In our setup, one hand holds the object steady while the other performs active exploration. We show that our method can actively explore an object's surface to identify critical pose features without prior knowledge of the object's geometry.

The core idea is to use MCTS to find a promising set of safe candidate trajectories and a deep IRL scoring function to select the most human-like among them. We evaluate TreeIRL against both classical and state-of-the-art planners in large-scale simulations and on 500+ miles of real-world autonomous driving in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Test scenarios include dense urban traffic, adaptive cruise control, cut-ins, and traffic lights. TreeIRL achieves the best overall performance, striking a balance between safety, progress, comfort, and human-likeness. To our knowledge, our work is the first demonstration of MCTS-based planning on public roads and underscores the importance of evaluating planners across a diverse set of metrics and in real-world environments. TreeIRL is highly extensible and could be further improved with reinforcement learning and imitation learning, providing a framework for exploring different combinations of classical and learning-based approaches to solve the planning bottleneck in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mining the Long Tail: A Comparative Study of Data-Centric Criticality Metrics for Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18397v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising paradigm for training autonomous vehicle (AV) planning policies from large-scale, real-world driving logs. However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane scenarios vastly outnumber rare "long-tail" events, leads to brittle and unsafe policies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address this challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data curation strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich samples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are categorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and behavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual timestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based architecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our results demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the baseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal achieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate by nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear trade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while scenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that intelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and reliable autonomous agents.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework that integrates a pre-trained human motion prior with a neural signed distance field (NSDF) representation to achieve robust whole-body embracing. Our method leverages a teacher-student architecture to distill large-scale human motion data, generating kinematically natural and physically feasible whole-body motion patterns. This facilitates coordinated control across the arms and torso, enabling stable multi-contact interactions that enhance the robustness in manipulation and also the load capacity. The embedded NSDF further provides accurate and continuous geometric perception, improving contact awareness throughout long-horizon tasks. We thoroughly evaluate the approach through comprehensive simulations and real-world experiments. The results demonstrate improved adaptability to diverse shapes and sizes of objects and also successful sim-to-real transfer. These indicate that the proposed framework offers an effective and practical solution for multi-contact and long-horizon WBM tasks of humanoid robots.</p></details> |  |

Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability. Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks, matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://tongyi-agent.github.io/blog/introducing-tongyi-deep-research/</p></details> |

The success of such attacks heavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original graph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness by relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental characteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local structures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework, called Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local level, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve geometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate structured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the generated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the semantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a sequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning agent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS framework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack effectiveness and stealthiness.</p></details> |  |

However, vision language reinforcement learning has primarily focused on a narrow set of tasks (e.g. geometry or chart reasoning), limiting the improvement of Vision Language Models' (VLMs) general reasoning. Therefore, we propose a novel Code2Logic approach, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize verifiable game reasoning tasks at scale via adapting game code. Using the Code2Logic, we developed the GameQA dataset to train and evaluate VLMs. GameQA is verifiable and scalable, offers controllable difficulty gradation and is diverse with 30 games and 158 tasks. Then we apply Game-RL, which is simple reinforcement learning on GameQA. Surprisingly, despite training solely on game tasks, VLMs demonstrated out of domain generalization, specifically Qwen2.5-VL-7B improving performance by 2.33% across 7 diverse vision-language benchmarks.

We propose a doubly-regularized RL framework combining reward and parameter regularization to address safety constraints in continuous state-action spaces. The problem is formulated as a convex regularized objective with parametrized policies in the mean-field regime. Leveraging mean-field theory and Wasserstein gradient flows, policies are modeled on an infinite-dimensional statistical manifold, with updates governed by parameter distribution gradient flows. Key contributions include solvability conditions for safety-constrained problems, smooth bounded approximations for gradient flows, and exponential convergence guarantees under sufficient regularization.

| **[Empowering Multi-Robot Cooperation via Sequential World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13095v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has shown significant potential in robotics due to its high sample efficiency and planning capability. However, extending MBRL to multi-robot cooperation remains challenging due to the complexity of joint dynamics. To address this, we propose the Sequential World Model (SeqWM), a novel framework that integrates the sequential paradigm into model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning. SeqWM employs independent, sequentially structured agent-wise world models to decompose complex joint dynamics. Latent rollouts and decision-making are performed through sequential communication, where each agent generates its future trajectory and plans its actions based on the predictions of its predecessors. This design enables explicit intention sharing, enhancing cooperative performance, and reduces communication overhead to linear complexity. Results in challenging simulated environments (Bi-DexHands and Multi-Quad) show that SeqWM outperforms existing state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines in both overall performance and sample efficiency, while exhibiting advanced cooperative behaviors such as predictive adaptation and role division. Furthermore, SeqWM has been success fully deployed on physical quadruped robots, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems. Demos and code are available at: https://github.com/zhaozijie2022/seqwm-marl</p></details> |  |
| **[Shaping Explanations: Semantic Reward Modeling with Encoder-Only Transformers for GRPO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13081v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating human-like text, aligning their outputs with complex, qualitative goals like pedagogical soundness remains a significant challenge. Standard reinforcement learning techniques often rely on slow and expensive LLM-as-a-judge evaluations or on brittle, keyword-based metrics like ROUGE, which fail to capture the semantic essence of a high-quality explanation. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to reward shaping within the Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) framework. Our central contribution is the use of a small, efficient encoder-only transformer as a semantic reward model. This model provides a dense, semantically rich reward signal based on the cosine similarity between a generated explanation and a ground-truth reference, guiding the policy towards explanations that are not just factually correct but also structurally and conceptually aligned with expert reasoning. We apply this method to the task of training a model for the Italian medical-school entrance examinations, following standard domain-adaptive continued pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our results demonstrate that GRPO with our proposed semantic reward significantly improves explanation faithfulness and clarity over a strong SFT baseline, showcasing the power of using lightweight encoder models for nuanced reward shaping in complex generation tasks</p></details> |  |

This is achieved by combining the adduction/abduction (Add/Abd) joint of digits four and five into a single joint with a large range of motion. The combined joint increases the workspace of the digits by 400\% and reduces the required DoFs while retaining dexterity. Experimental results demonstrate that the combined Add/Abd joint enables the hand to grasp objects with a side distance of up to 200 mm. Reinforcement learning-based investigations show that the design enables grasping policies that are effective not only for handling larger objects but also for achieving enhanced grasp stability. In teleoperated trials, the hand successfully performed 86\% of attempted grasps on suitable YCB objects, including challenging non-anthropomorphic configurations. These findings validate the design's ability to enhance grasp stability, flexibility, and dexterous manipulation without added complexity, making it well-suited for a wide range of applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First five listed authors have equal contribution</p></details> |
| **[Perception Before Reasoning: Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning for Visual Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13031v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance. However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[PVPO: Pre-Estimated Value-Based Policy Optimization for Agentic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21104v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks. However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the number of rollouts during training. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to improve training efficiency. Moreover, PVPO is orthogonal to other advanced critic-free RL algorithms, making it compatible with and complementary to these methods. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

This enables onboard AI systems to optimize charge-aware path optimization customized to reflect vehicle's current condition and environment. We present VEGA, a charge-aware EV navigation agent that plans over a charger-annotated road graph using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with budgeted A* teacher-student guidance under state-of-charge (SoC) feasibility. VEGA consists of two modules. First, a physics-informed neural operator (PINO), trained on real vehicle speed and battery-power logs, uses recent vehicle speed logs to estimate aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, mass, motor and regenerative-braking efficiencies, and auxiliary load by learning a vehicle-custom dynamics. Second, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent uses these dynamics to optimize a path with optimal charging stops and dwell times under SoC constraints. VEGA requires no additional sensors and uses only vehicle speed signals. It may serve as a virtual sensor for power and efficiency to potentially reduce EV cost. In evaluation on long routes like San Francisco to New York, VEGA's stops, dwell times, SoC management, and total travel time closely track Tesla Trip Planner while being slightly more conservative, presumably due to real vehicle conditions such as vehicle parameter drift due to deterioration. Although trained only in U.S. regions, VEGA was able to compute optimal charge-aware paths in France and Japan, demonstrating generalizability. It achieves practical integration of physics-informed learning and RL for EV eco-routing.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) for possible publication</p></details> |

Among filter, wrapper, and embedded-based approaches, the reinforcement learning (RL)-based subspace exploration strategy provides a novel objective optimization-directed perspective and promising performance. Nevertheless, even with improved performance, current reinforcement learning approaches face challenges similar to conventional methods when dealing with complex datasets. These challenges stem from the inefficient paradigm of using one agent per feature and the inherent complexities present in the datasets. This observation motivates us to investigate and address the above issue and propose a novel approach, namely HRLFS. Our methodology initially employs a Large Language Model (LLM)-based hybrid state extractor to capture each feature's mathematical and semantic characteristics. Based on this information, features are clustered, facilitating the construction of hierarchical agents for each cluster and sub-cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of our approach. Compared to contemporary or the one-feature-one-agent RL-based approaches, HRLFS improves the downstream ML performance with iterative feature subspace exploration while accelerating total run time by reducing the number of agents involved.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, keywords: Automated Feature Engineering, Tabular Dataset, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Feature Selection</p></details> |
| **[Worst-Case Symbolic Constraints Analysis and Generalisation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08171v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on coding tasks such as generation, completion and repair, but their ability to handle complex symbolic reasoning over code still remains underexplored. We introduce the task of worst-case symbolic constraints analysis, which requires inferring the symbolic constraints that characterise worst-case program executions; these constraints can be solved to obtain inputs that expose performance bottlenecks or denial-of-service vulnerabilities in software systems. We show that even state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) struggle when applied directly on this task. To address this challenge, we propose WARP, an innovative neurosymbolic approach that computes worst-case constraints on smaller concrete input sizes using existing program analysis tools, and then leverages LLMs to generalise these constraints to larger input sizes. Concretely, WARP comprises: (1) an incremental strategy for LLM-based worst-case reasoning, (2) a solver-aligned neurosymbolic framework that integrates reinforcement learning with SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solving, and (3) a curated dataset of symbolic constraints. Experimental results show that WARP consistently improves performance on worst-case constraint reasoning. Leveraging the curated constraint dataset, we use reinforcement learning to fine-tune a model, WARP-1.0-3B, which significantly outperforms size-matched and even larger baselines. These results demonstrate that incremental constraint reasoning enhances LLMs' ability to handle symbolic reasoning and highlight the potential for deeper integration between neural learning and formal methods in rigorous program analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, the prevailing approach of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) induces diffuse, opaque parameter changes, making it difficult to discern what the model has internalized. Hence, we introduce Feature Steering with Reinforcement Learning (FSRL), a transparent alignment framework that trains a lightweight adapter to steer behavior by modulating interpretable features from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). First, we demonstrate that FSRL is an effective method for preference optimization and is comparable with current RLHF methods. We then perform mechanistic analysis on the trained adapter, and find that its policy systematically promotes style features over explicit alignment concepts, suggesting that the preference optimization process rewards stylistic presentation as a proxy for quality. Ultimately, we hope that FSRL provides a tool for both interpretable model control and diagnosing the internal mechanisms of alignment.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

While StarCraft II-related environments have driven significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception, thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency, to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 13 figures with appendix</p></details> |

However, real-world user instructions are immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge. Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image manipulation functions, enabling fine-grained composition of editing actions by the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM, equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world instructions. Experiments demonstrate that Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench. It exhibits robust reasoning capabilities for open-domain instructions and can utilize newly introduced editing tools without additional fine-tuning.

However, compared to the rapid developments in the AI community, recommendation systems have not achieved a breakthrough in recent years. For instance, they still rely on a multi-stage cascaded architecture rather than an end-to-end approach, leading to computational fragmentation and optimization inconsistencies, and hindering the effective application of key breakthrough technologies from the AI community in recommendation scenarios. To address these issues, we propose OneRec, which reshapes the recommendation system through an end-to-end generative approach and achieves promising results. Firstly, we have enhanced the computational FLOPs of the current recommendation model by 10 $\times$ and have identified the scaling laws for recommendations within certain boundaries. Secondly, reinforcement learning techniques, previously difficult to apply for optimizing recommendations, show significant potential in this framework. Lastly, through infrastructure optimizations, we have achieved 23.7% and 28.8% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) on flagship GPUs during training and inference, respectively, aligning closely with the LLM community. This architecture significantly reduces communication and storage overhead, resulting in operating expense that is only 10.6% of traditional recommendation pipelines. Deployed in Kuaishou/Kuaishou Lite APP, it handles 25% of total queries per second, enhancing overall App Stay Time by 0.54% and 1.24%, respectively. Additionally, we have observed significant increases in metrics such as 7-day Lifetime, which is a crucial indicator of recommendation experience. We also provide practical lessons and insights derived from developing, optimizing, and maintaining a production-scale recommendation system with significant real-world impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed alphabetically by their first name</p></details> |

To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and multi-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports integration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing across steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function, combining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy optimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample queue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of costly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1 substantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\% gain over strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks. These results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and efficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications.

OneRec reformulates recommendation as an autoregressive generation task, achieving high Model FLOPs Utilization. While OneRec-V1 has shown significant empirical success in real-world deployment, two critical challenges hinder its scalability and performance: (1) inefficient computational allocation where 97.66% of resources are consumed by sequence encoding rather than generation, and (2) limitations in reinforcement learning relying solely on reward models. To address these challenges, we propose OneRec-V2, featuring: (1) Lazy Decoder-Only Architecture: Eliminates encoder bottlenecks, reducing total computation by 94% and training resources by 90%, enabling successful scaling to 8B parameters. (2) Preference Alignment with Real-World User Interactions: Incorporates Duration-Aware Reward Shaping and Adaptive Ratio Clipping to better align with user preferences using real-world feedback. Extensive A/B tests on Kuaishou demonstrate OneRec-V2's effectiveness, improving App Stay Time by 0.467%/0.741% while balancing multi-objective recommendations.

| **[GRATE: a Graph transformer-based deep Reinforcement learning Approach for Time-efficient autonomous robot Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12863v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robot exploration (ARE) is the process of a robot autonomously navigating and mapping an unknown environment. Recent Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approaches typically formulate ARE as a sequential decision-making problem defined on a collision-free informative graph. However, these methods often demonstrate limited reasoning ability over graph-structured data. Moreover, due to the insufficient consideration of robot motion, the resulting RL policies are generally optimized to minimize travel distance, while neglecting time efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRATE, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approach that leverages a Graph Transformer to effectively capture both local structure patterns and global contextual dependencies of the informative graph, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning capability across the entire environment. In addition, we deploy a Kalman filter to smooth the waypoint outputs, ensuring that the resulting path is kinodynamically feasible for the robot to follow. Experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits better exploration efficiency (up to 21.5% in distance and 21.3% in time to complete exploration) than state-of-the-art conventional and learning-based baselines in various simulation benchmarks. We also validate our planner in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Representation Learning for Robust Sim-to-Real Transfer of Adaptive Humanoid Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12858v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has produced remarkable advances in humanoid locomotion, yet a fundamental dilemma persists for real-world deployment: policies must choose between the robustness of reactive proprioceptive control or the proactivity of complex, fragile perception-driven systems. This paper resolves this dilemma by introducing a paradigm that imbues a purely proprioceptive policy with proactive capabilities, achieving the foresight of perception without its deployment-time costs. Our core contribution is a contrastive learning framework that compels the actor's latent state to encode privileged environmental information from simulation. Crucially, this ``distilled awareness" empowers an adaptive gait clock, allowing the policy to proactively adjust its rhythm based on an inferred understanding of the terrain. This synergy resolves the classic trade-off between rigid, clocked gaits and unstable clock-free policies. We validate our approach with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer to a full-sized humanoid, demonstrating highly robust locomotion over challenging terrains, including 30 cm high steps and 26.5{\deg} slopes, proving the effectiveness of our method.

| **[Safe Reinforcement Learning using Action Projection: Safeguard the Policy or the Environment?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12833v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projection-based safety filters, which modify unsafe actions by mapping them to the closest safe alternative, are widely used to enforce safety constraints in reinforcement learning (RL). Two integration strategies are commonly considered: Safe environment RL (SE-RL), where the safeguard is treated as part of the environment, and safe policy RL (SP-RL), where it is embedded within the policy through differentiable optimization layers. Despite their practical relevance in safety-critical settings, a formal understanding of their differences is lacking. In this work, we present a theoretical comparison of SE-RL and SP-RL. We identify a key distinction in how each approach is affected by action aliasing, a phenomenon in which multiple unsafe actions are projected to the same safe action, causing information loss in the policy gradients. In SE-RL, this effect is implicitly approximated by the critic, while in SP-RL, it manifests directly as rank-deficient Jacobians during backpropagation through the safeguard. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a unified formalization of SE-RL and SP-RL in the context of actor-critic algorithms, (ii) a theoretical analysis of their respective policy gradient estimates, highlighting the role of action aliasing, and (iii) a comparative study of mitigation strategies, including a novel penalty-based improvement for SP-RL that aligns with established SE-RL practices. Empirical results support our theoretical predictions, showing that action aliasing is more detrimental for SP-RL than for SE-RL. However, with appropriate improvement strategies, SP-RL can match or outperform improved SE-RL across a range of environments. These findings provide actionable insights for choosing and refining projection-based safe RL methods based on task characteristics.</p></details> |  |

While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost, most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Purely template-based or end-to-end reinforcement learning-based methods suffer from such harsh terrains. This paper proposes a two stage training framework for such narrow path traversing tasks, coupling a template-based foothold planner with a low-level foothold tracker from Stage-I training and a lightweight perception aided foothold modifier from Stage-II training. With the curriculum setup from flat ground to narrow paths across stages, the resulted controller in turn learns to robustly track and safely modify foothold targets to ensure precise foot placement over narrow paths. This framework preserves the interpretability from the physics-based template and takes advantage of the generalization capability from reinforcement learning, resulting in easy sim-to-real transfer. The learned policies outperform purely template-based or reinforcement learning-based baselines in terms of success rate, centerline adherence and safety margins. Validation on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot yields successful traversal of a 0.2m wide and 3m long beam for 20 trials without any failure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://huangtc233.github.io/Traversing-the-Narrow-Path/</p></details> |

Most existing scheduling systems follow a reactive paradigm, relying solely on the current system state to make decisions, without considering how task demand and resource availability evolve over time. This lack of temporal awareness in reactive approaches leads to inefficient GPU utilization, high task migration overhead, and poor system responsiveness under dynamic workloads. In this work, we identify the fundamental limitations of these instantaneous-state-only scheduling approaches and propose Temporal Optimal Resource scheduling via Two-layer Architecture (TORTA). TORTA introduces a spatiotemporal scheduling framework that captures both long-term workload patterns and short-term execution constraints. It adopts a two-layer design: a macro-level scheduler leverages reinforcement learning and optimal transport to coordinate inter-region task distribution, while a micro-level allocator refines task-to-server assignments within each region to reduce latency and switching costs. Experimental results across multiple network topologies show that TORTA reduces average inference response time by up to 15\%, improves load balance by approximately 4-5\%, and cuts total operational cost by 10-20\% compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures |

However, these models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships. This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models. Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new, high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations offer promising solutions with their global coverage capabilities and reduced latency, yet struggle with intermittent coverage and limited communication windows due to orbital dynamics. This paper introduces an age of information (AoI)-aware space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture that leverages a high-altitude platform (HAP) as intelligent relay between the LEO satellites and ground terminals. Our three-layer design employs hybrid free-space optical (FSO) links for high-capacity satellite-to-HAP communication and reliable radio frequency (RF) links for HAP-to-ground transmission, and thus addressing the temporal discontinuity in LEO satellite coverage while serving diverse user priorities. Specifically, we formulate a joint optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the AoI and satellite handover frequency through optimal transmit power distribution and satellite selection decisions. This highly dynamic, non-convex problem with time-coupled constraints presents significant computational challenges for traditional approaches. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-enhanced dueling double deep Q-network with action decomposition and state transformer encoder (DD3QN-AS) algorithm that incorporates transformer-based temporal feature extraction and employs a DM-based latent prompt generative module to refine state-action representations through conditional denoising. Simulation results highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach compared with policy-based methods and some other deep reinforcement learning (DRL) benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

To address efficiency-capability trade-off, we propose the Guess-Think-Answer (GTA) framework that combines the efficiency of SFT with the capability gains of RL in a unified training paradigm. GTA works by having the model first produce a provisional guess (optimized via cross-entropy loss), then reflect on this guess before generating the final answer, with RL rewards shaping both the final output and the format of the entire GTA structure. This hybrid approach achieves both faster convergence than pure RL and higher performance ceiling than pure SFT. To mitigate gradient conflicts between the two training signals, we employ loss masking and gradient constraints. Empirical results on four text classification benchmarks demonstrate that GTA substantially accelerates convergence while outperforming both standalone SFT and RL baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Existing security paradigms face a critical bottleneck: efficiently identifying worst-case scenarios and rapidly coordinating defensive responses are hindered by intensive computation and time delays, during which cascading failures can propagate. This paper presents a novel tri-level robust constrained reinforcement learning (RCRL) framework for robust power system security. The framework generates diverse system states through AC-OPF formulations, identifies worst-case N-K attack scenarios for each state, and trains policies to mitigate these scenarios across all operating conditions without requiring predefined attack patterns. The framework addresses constraint satisfaction through Beta-blending projection-based feasible action mapping techniques during training and primal-dual augmented Lagrangian optimization for deployment. Once trained, the RCRL policy learns how to control observed cyber-physical attacks in real time. Validation on IEEE benchmark systems demonstrates effectiveness against coordinated N-K attacks, causing widespread cascading failures throughout the network. The learned policy can successfully respond rapidly to recover system-wide constraints back to normal within 0.21 ms inference times, establishing superior resilience for critical infrastructure protection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[A Unified Learning-based Optimization Framework for 0-1 Mixed Problems in Wireless Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12664v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several wireless networking problems are often posed as 0-1 mixed optimization problems, which involve binary variables (e.g., selection of access points, channels, and tasks) and continuous variables (e.g., allocation of bandwidth, power, and computing resources). Traditional optimization methods as well as reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been widely exploited to solve these problems under different network scenarios. However, solving such problems becomes more challenging when dealing with a large network scale, multi-dimensional radio resources, and diversified service requirements. To this end, in this paper, a unified framework that combines RL and optimization theory is proposed to solve 0-1 mixed optimization problems in wireless networks. First, RL is used to capture the process of solving binary variables as a sequential decision-making task. During the decision-making steps, the binary (0-1) variables are relaxed and, then, a relaxed problem is solved to obtain a relaxed solution, which serves as prior information to guide RL searching policy. Then, at the end of decision-making process, the search policy is updated via suboptimal objective value based on decisions made. The performance bound and convergence guarantees of the proposed framework are then proven theoretically. An extension of this approach is provided to solve problems with a non-convex objective function and/or non-convex constraints. Numerical results show that the proposed approach reduces the convergence time by about 30% over B&B in small-scale problems with slightly higher objective values. In large-scale scenarios, it can improve the normalized objective values by 20% over RL with a shorter convergence time.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, there is a considerable preference bias towards specific strategies. Prior methods using fine-tuned strategy planners have shown potential in reducing such bias, while the underlying causes of the preference bias in LLMs have not well been studied. To address these issues, we first reveal the fundamental causes of the bias by identifying the knowledge boundaries of LLMs in strategy planning. Then, we propose an approach to mitigate the bias by reinforcement learning with a dual reward function, which optimizes strategy planning via both accuracy and entropy-based confidence for each region according to the knowledge boundaries. Experiments on the ESCov and ExTES datasets with multiple LLM backbones show that our approach outperforms the baselines, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Beyond conventional reward-seeking reinforcement learning (RL), the agent perceives and reasons over a multi-dimensional context that jointly captures queueing delay, link quality, coexistence intensity, and switching stability. A capacity-aware, quality of service (QoS)-constrained reward aligns the agent with goal-oriented scheduling rather than static thresholding. Under constrained licensed bandwidth, the proposed design reduces blocking by up to 87.5% versus threshold policies while preserving throughput, highlighting the value of context-driven decisions in coexistence-limited NR SL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, accepted by 2025 IEEE Globecom Workshops</p></details> |

Both are essential for raw or long-tail word recognition. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage learning paradigm. First, we introduce a pronunciation-guided context learning method. It employs an interleaved grapheme-phoneme context modeling strategy that incorporates grapheme-only distractors, encouraging the model to leverage phonemic cues for accurate recognition. Then, we propose a pronunciation-discriminative reinforcement learning method with perturbed label sampling to further enhance the model\'s ability to distinguish contextualized homophones. Experimental results on the public English Librispeech and Mandarin AISHELL-1 datasets indicate that PAC: (1) reduces relative Word Error Rate (WER) by 30.2% and 53.8% compared to pre-trained LLM-based ASR models, and (2) achieves 31.8% and 60.5% relative reductions in biased WER for long-tail words compared to strong baselines, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[ActiveVLN: Towards Active Exploration via Multi-Turn RL in Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12618v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task requires an agent to follow natural language instructions and navigate through complex environments. Existing MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and often use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While effective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However, prior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend on expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended active exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and plausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose ActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through multi-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is used for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively predicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and optimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL efficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail or likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations. Experiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training methods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches despite using a smaller model. Code and data will be released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[EconProver: Towards More Economical Test-Time Scaling for Automated Theorem Proving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12603v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently advanced the field of Automated Theorem Proving (ATP), attaining substantial performance gains through widely adopted test-time scaling strategies, notably reflective Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and increased sampling passes. However, they both introduce significant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance pass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and ProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides actionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces $Agent^2$, a novel agent-generates-agent framework that achieves fully automated RL agent design through intelligent LLM-driven generation. The system autonomously transforms natural language task descriptions and environment code into comprehensive, high-performance reinforcement learning solutions without human intervention. $Agent^2$ features a revolutionary dual-agent architecture. The Generator Agent serves as an autonomous AI designer that analyzes tasks and generates executable RL agents, while the Target Agent is the resulting automatically generated RL agent. The framework decomposes RL development into two distinct stages: MDP modeling and algorithmic optimization, enabling more targeted and effective agent generation. Built on the Model Context Protocol, $Agent^2$ provides a unified framework that standardizes intelligent agent creation across diverse environments and algorithms, while incorporating adaptive training management and intelligent feedback analysis for continuous improvement. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmarks, including MuJoCo, MetaDrive, MPE, and SMAC, demonstrate that $Agent^2$ consistently outperforms manually designed solutions across all tasks, achieving up to 55% performance improvement and substantial gains on average. By enabling truly end-to-end, closed-loop automation, this work establishes a new paradigm in which intelligent agents design and optimize other agents, marking a fundamental breakthrough for automated AI systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

The typical approach, where a policy and vision encoder are trained jointly from scratch, generalizes poorly to novel visual scene changes. Using pre-trained vision models (PVMs) to inform a policy network improves robustness in model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). Recent developments in Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) suggest that MBRL is more sample-efficient than MFRL. However, counterintuitively, existing work has found PVMs to be ineffective in MBRL. Here, we investigate PVM's effectiveness in MBRL, specifically on generalization under visual domain shifts. We show that, in scenarios with severe shifts, PVMs perform much better than a baseline model trained from scratch. We further investigate the effects of varying levels of fine-tuning of PVMs. Our results show that partial fine-tuning can maintain the highest average task performance under the most extreme distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that PVMs are highly successful in promoting robustness in visual policy learning, providing compelling evidence for their wider adoption in model-based robotic learning applications.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, which can significantly degrade user experience in real-world ASR applications. In this paper, we present FunAudio-ASR, a large-scale, LLM-based ASR system that synergistically combines massive data, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse and complex speech recognition scenarios. Moreover, FunAudio-ASR is specifically optimized for practical deployment, with enhancements in streaming capability, noise robustness, code-switching, hotword customization, and satisfying other real-world application requirements. Experimental results show that while most LLM-based ASR systems achieve strong performance on open-source benchmarks, they often underperform on real industry evaluation sets. Thanks to production-oriented optimizations, FunAudio-ASR achieves SOTA performance on real application datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in practical settings.</p></details> |  |

In millimeter-wave (mmWave) 5G/6G networks, the deployment of Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) nodes faces highly dynamic urban environments, necessitating intelligent DT-enabled optimization frameworks. Traditional IAB deployment optimization approaches struggle with the combinatorial complexity of jointly optimizing coverage, connectivity, and resilience, often leading to suboptimal solutions that are vulnerable to network disruptions. With this consideration, we propose a novel Graph Attention Network v2 (GATv2)-based reinforcement learning approach for resilient IAB deployment in urban mmWave networks. Specifically, we formulate the deployment problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with explicit resilience constraints and employ edge-conditioned GATv2 to capture complex spatial dependencies between heterogeneous node types and dynamic connectivity patterns. The attention mechanism enables the model to focus on critical deployment locations to maximize coverage and ensure fault tolerance through redundant backhaul connections. To address the inherent vulnerability of mmWave links, we train the GATv2 policy using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a carefully designed balance between coverage, cost, and resilience. Comprehensive simulations across three urban scenarios demonstrate that our method achieves 98.5-98.7 percent coverage with 14.3-26.7 percent fewer nodes than baseline approaches, while maintaining 87.1 percent coverage retention under 30 percent link failures, representing 11.3-15.4 percent improvement in fault tolerance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 6 pages |

This paper considers the problem of solving budget-constrained multi-component monotonic POMDPs, where a finite budget limits the maximal number of restorative actions. For a large number of components, solving such a POMDP using current methods is computationally intractable due to the exponential growth in the state space with an increasing number of components. To address this challenge, we propose a two-step approach. Since the individual components of a budget-constrained multi-component monotonic POMDP are only connected via the shared budget, we first approximate the optimal budget allocation among these components using an approximation of each component POMDP's optimal value function which is obtained through a random forest model. Subsequently, we introduce an oracle-guided meta-trained Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to solve each of the independent budget-constrained single-component monotonic POMDPs. The oracle policy is obtained by performing value iteration on the corresponding monotonic Markov Decision Process (MDP). This two-step method provides scalability in solving truly massive multi-component monotonic POMDPs. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we consider a real-world maintenance scenario that involves inspection and repair of an administrative building by a team of agents within a maintenance budget. Finally, we perform a computational complexity analysis for a varying number of components to show the scalability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores the integration of a reinforcement learning agent in a market-making context, where the underlying market dynamics have been explicitly modeled to capture observed stylized facts of real markets, including clustered order arrival times, non-stationary spreads and return drifts, stochastic order quantities and price volatility. These mechanisms aim to enhance stability of the resulting control agent, and serve to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into the agent policy learning process. Our contributions include a practical implementation of a market making agent based on the Proximal-Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, alongside a comparative evaluation of the agent's performance under varying market conditions via a simulator-based environment. As evidenced by our analysis of the financial return and risk metrics when compared to a closed-form optimal solution, our results suggest that the reinforcement learning agent can effectively be used under non-stationary market conditions, and that the proposed simulator-based environment can serve as a valuable tool for training and pre-training reinforcement learning agents in market-making scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, 31 equations</p></details> |

Existing studies typically improve energy and travel efficiency for individual CAVs without considering their impacts on the entire mixed-traffic platoon, leading to inefficient traffic flow. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to achieve platoon-level control in a mixed-traffic environment, the training of RL is still challenged by (i) car-following safety, i.e., CAVs should not collide with their immediate preceding vehicles, and (ii) red-light safety, i.e., CAVs should not run red lights. To address these challenges, this paper develops a platoon-centric, safe RL-based GLOSA system that uses a multi-agent controller to optimize CAV speed while achieving a balance between energy consumption and travel efficiency. We further incorporate Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) into the RL-based policy to provide explicit safety guarantees in terms of car-following safety and red-light safety. Our simulation results illustrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of driving safety and platoon energy consumption.</p></details> |  |

Despite its promise, RL is susceptible to attacks designed either to compromise policy learning or to induce erroneous decisions by trained agents. Although the literature on RL security has grown rapidly and several surveys exist, existing categorizations often fall short in guiding the selection of appropriate defenses for specific systems. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of 86 recent studies on RL security, addressing these limitations by systematically categorizing attacks and defenses according to defined threat models and single- versus multi-agent settings. Furthermore, we examine the relevance and applicability of state-of-the-art attacks and defense mechanisms within the context of autonomous driving, providing insights to inform the design of robust RL systems.</p></details> |  |

Through quantitative analysis, we observe that current VRMs exhibit limited visual reflection, as their attention to visual information diminishes rapidly with longer generated responses. To address this challenge, we propose a new VRM \textbf{Reflection-V}, which enhances visual reflection based on reasoning data construction for cold-start and reward design for reinforcement learning (RL). Firstly, we construct vision-centered reasoning data by leveraging an agent that interacts between VLMs and reasoning LLMs, enabling cold-start learning of visual reflection patterns. Secondly, a visual attention based reward model is employed during RL to encourage reasoning based on visual information. Therefore, \textbf{Reflection-V} demonstrates significant improvements across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, \textbf{Reflection-V} maintains a stronger and more consistent reliance on visual information during visual reasoning, indicating effective enhancement in visual reflection capabilities.</p></details> | EMNLP2025 Main |

Without centralized oversight, malicious actors coordinate shilling campaigns and pump-and-dump schemes across various platforms. We propose a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for decentralized manipulation detection, modeling the interaction between manipulators and detectors as a dynamic adversarial game. This framework identifies suspicious patterns using delayed token price reactions as financial indicators.Our method introduces three innovations: (1) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance learning stability in sparse-reward and partially observable settings; (2) a theory-based reward function inspired by rational expectations and information asymmetry, differentiating price discovery from manipulation noise; and (3) a multi-modal agent pipeline that integrates LLM-based semantic features, social graph signals, and on-chain market data for informed decision-making.The framework is integrated within the Symphony system, a decentralized multi-agent architecture enabling peer-to-peer agent execution and trust-aware learning through distributed logs, supporting chain-verifiable evaluation. Symphony promotes adversarial co-evolution among strategic actors and maintains robust manipulation detection without centralized oracles, enabling real-time surveillance across global DeFi ecosystems.Trained on 100,000 real-world discourse episodes and validated in adversarial simulations, Hide-and-Shill achieves top performance in detection accuracy and causal attribution. This work bridges multi-agent systems with financial surveillance, advancing a new paradigm for decentralized market intelligence. All resources are available at the Hide-and-Shill GitHub repository to promote open research and reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[$K$-Level Policy Gradients for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12117v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Actor-critic algorithms for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) typically employ a policy update that responds to the current strategies of other agents. While being straightforward, this approach does not account for the updates of other agents at the same update step, resulting in miscoordination. In this paper, we introduce the $K$-Level Policy Gradient (KPG), a method that recursively updates each agent against the updated policies of other agents, speeding up the discovery of effective coordinated policies. We theoretically prove that KPG with finite iterates achieves monotonic convergence to a local Nash equilibrium under certain conditions. We provide principled implementations of KPG by applying it to the deep MARL algorithms MAPPO, MADDPG, and FACMAC. Empirically, we demonstrate superior performance over existing deep MARL algorithms in StarCraft II and multi-agent MuJoCo.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We accomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a 360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze on top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the hand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct action predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements a foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small compute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable fixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors. We evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring manipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate manipulation over large workspaces with a single camera.

Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought (CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training. We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations, achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring manually annotated CoTs.Code and resources are available at: https://github.com/HSH55/RISE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compositional shield synthesis for safe reinforcement learning in partial observability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12085v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents controlled by the output of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often transition to unsafe states, particularly in uncertain and partially observable environments. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a natural setting for studying such scenarios with limited sensing. Shields filter undesirable actions to ensure safe RL by preserving safety requirements in the agents' policy. However, synthesizing holistic shields is computationally expensive in complex deployment scenarios. We propose the compositional synthesis of shields by modeling safety requirements by parts, thereby improving scalability. In particular, problem formulations in the form of POMDPs using RL algorithms illustrate that an RL agent equipped with the resulting compositional shielding, beyond being safe, converges to higher values of expected reward. By using subproblem formulations, we preserve and improve the ability of shielded agents to require fewer training episodes than unshielded agents, especially in sparse-reward settings. Concretely, we find that compositional shield synthesis allows an RL agent to remain safe in environments two orders of magnitude larger than other state-of-the-art model-based approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gait-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Phase Curriculum for Humanoid Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20619v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a unified gait-conditioned reinforcement learning framework that enables humanoid robots to perform standing, walking, running, and smooth transitions within a single recurrent policy. A compact reward routing mechanism dynamically activates gait-specific objectives based on a one-hot gait ID, mitigating reward interference and supporting stable multi-gait learning. Human-inspired reward terms promote biomechanically natural motions, such as straight-knee stance and coordinated arm-leg swing, without requiring motion capture data. A structured curriculum progressively introduces gait complexity and expands command space over multiple phases. In simulation, the policy successfully achieves robust standing, walking, running, and gait transitions. On the real Unitree G1 humanoid, we validate standing, walking, and walk-to-stand transitions, demonstrating stable and coordinated locomotion. This work provides a scalable, reference-free solution toward versatile and naturalistic humanoid control across diverse modes and environments.</p></details> |  |

We propose Hi-DARTS, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses this trade-off. Hi-DARTS utilizes a meta-agent to analyze market volatility and dynamically activate specialized Time Frame Agents for high-frequency or low-frequency trading as needed. During back-testing on AAPL stock from January 2024 to May 2025, Hi-DARTS yielded a cumulative return of 25.17% with a Sharpe Ratio of 0.75. This performance surpasses standard benchmarks, including a passive buy-and-hold strategy on AAPL (12.19% return) and the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) (20.01% return). Our work demonstrates that dynamic, hierarchical agents can achieve superior risk-adjusted returns while maintaining high computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper at International Conference on ICT Convergence 2025</p></details> |
| **[Imitation Learning as Return Distribution Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12026v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of training a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) agent through imitation learning (IL). Unlike standard IL, our goal is not only to train an agent that matches the expert's expected return (i.e., its average performance) but also its risk attitude (i.e., other features of the return distribution, such as variance). We propose a general formulation of the risk-sensitive IL problem in which the objective is to match the expert's return distribution in Wasserstein distance. We focus on the tabular setting and assume the expert's reward is known. After demonstrating the limited expressivity of Markovian policies for this task, we introduce an efficient and sufficiently expressive subclass of non-Markovian policies tailored to it. Building on this subclass, we develop two provably efficient algorithms, RS-BC and RS-KT, for solving the problem when the transition model is unknown and known, respectively. We show that RS-KT achieves substantially lower sample complexity than RS-BC by exploiting dynamics information. We further demonstrate the sample efficiency of return distribution matching in the setting where the expert's reward is unknown by designing an oracle-based variant of RS-KT. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis of RS-KT and RS-BC with numerical simulations, highlighting both their sample efficiency and the advantages of non-Markovian policies over standard sample-efficient IL algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizing Behavior via Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Closed-Form Reward Centroids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12010v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of generalizing an expert agent's behavior, provided through demonstrations, to new environments and/or additional constraints. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) offers a promising solution by seeking to recover the expert's underlying reward function, which, if used for planning in the new settings, would reproduce the desired behavior. However, IRL is inherently ill-posed: multiple reward functions, forming the so-called feasible set, can explain the same observed behavior. Since these rewards may induce different policies in the new setting, in the absence of additional information, a decision criterion is needed to select which policy to deploy. In this paper, we propose a novel, principled criterion that selects the "average" policy among those induced by the rewards in a certain bounded subset of the feasible set. Remarkably, we show that this policy can be obtained by planning with the reward centroid of that subset, for which we derive a closed-form expression. We then present a provably efficient algorithm for estimating this centroid using an offline dataset of expert demonstrations only. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations that illustrate the relationship between the expert's behavior and the behavior produced by our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learned Controllers for Agile Quadrotors in Pursuit-Evasion Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02849v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of agile 1v1 quadrotor pursuit-evasion, where a pursuer and an evader learn to outmaneuver each other through reinforcement learning (RL). Such settings face two major challenges: non-stationarity, since each agent's evolving policy alters the environment dynamics and destabilizes training, and catastrophic forgetting, where a policy overfits to the current adversary and loses effectiveness against previously encountered strategies. To tackle these issues, we propose an Asynchronous Multi-Stage Population-Based (AMSPB) algorithm. At each stage, the pursuer and evader are trained asynchronously against a frozen pool of opponents sampled from a growing population of past and current policies, stabilizing training and ensuring exposure to diverse behaviors. Within this framework, we train neural network controllers that output either velocity commands or body rates with collective thrust. Experiments in a high-fidelity simulator show that: (i) AMSPB-trained RL policies outperform RL and geometric baselines; (ii) body-rate-and-thrust controllers achieve more agile flight than velocity-based controllers, leading to better pursuit-evasion performance; (iii) AMSPB yields stable, monotonic gains across stages; and (iv) trained policies in one arena size generalize fairly well to other sizes without retraining.</p></details> | Under review |

The flow dynamics can be time-varying and chaotic, resulting in sporadic and intermittent sensor readings, and complex environmental geometries further complicate a team's ability to model and predict the dispersion. To accurately account for the physical processes that drive the dispersion dynamics, robots must have access to computationally intensive numerical models, which can be difficult when onboard computation is limited. We present a distributed mobile sensing framework for source localization in which each robot carries a machine-learned, finite element model of its environment to guide information-based sampling. The models are used to evaluate an approximate mutual information criterion to drive an infotaxis control strategy, which selects sensing regions that are expected to maximize informativeness for the source localization objective. Our approach achieves faster error reduction compared to baseline sensing strategies and results in more accurate source localization compared to baseline machine learning approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, current VLAs often struggle to satisfy precise task constraints, such as stopping based on numeric thresholds, since their observation-to-action mappings are implicitly shaped by training data and lack explicit mechanisms for condition monitoring. In this work, we propose CLAW (CLIP-Language-Action for Weight), a framework that decouples condition evaluation from action generation. CLAW leverages a fine-tuned CLIP model as a lightweight prompt generator, which continuously monitors the digital readout of a scale and produces discrete directives based on task-specific weight thresholds. These prompts are then consumed by $\pi_0$, a flow-based VLA policy, which integrates the prompts with multi-view camera observations to produce continuous robot actions. This design enables CLAW to combine symbolic weight reasoning with high-frequency visuomotor control. We validate CLAW on three experimental setups: single-object grasping and mixed-object tasks requiring dual-arm manipulation. Across all conditions, CLAW reliably executes weight-aware behaviors and outperforms both raw-$\pi_0$ and fine-tuned $\pi_0$ models. We have uploaded the videos as supplementary materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Partial reverse engineering of Unitree's proprietary FMX encryption reveal a static Blowfish-ECB layer and a predictable LCG mask-enabled inspection of the system's otherwise sophisticated security architecture, the most mature we have observed in commercial robotics. Two empirical case studies expose the critical risk of this humanoid robot: (a) the robot functions as a trojan horse, continuously exfiltrating multi-modal sensor and service-state telemetry to 43.175.228.18:17883 and 43.175.229.18:17883 every 300 seconds without operator notice, creating violations of GDPR Articles 6 and 13; (b) a resident Cybersecurity AI (CAI) agent can pivot from reconnaissance to offensive preparation against any target, such as the manufacturer's cloud control plane, demonstrating escalation from passive monitoring to active counter-operations. These findings argue for adaptive CAI-powered defenses as humanoids move into critical infrastructure, contributing the empirical evidence needed to shape future security standards for physical-cyber convergence systems.</p></details> |  |

We propose VCST-RCP, a Voronoi-Constrained Steiner Tree Relay Coordination Planning framework that constructs sparse relay trunks using Steiner tree optimization and then synthesizes robot-level pickup, relay, and delivery schedules. This framework reframes relays from incidental byproducts into central elements of coordination, offering a contrast with traditional delivery methods that rely on direct source-to-destination transport. Extensive experiments show consistent improvements of up to 34% compared to conventional baselines, underscoring the benefits of incorporating relays into the delivery process. These improvements translate directly to enhanced energy efficiency in multi-robot delivery under capacity constraints, providing a scalable framework for real-world logistics.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Cybersecurity of a Humanoid Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14096v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of humanoid robotics presents unprecedented cybersecurity challenges that existing theoretical frameworks fail to adequately address. This report presents a comprehensive security assessment of a production humanoid robot platform, bridging the gap between abstract security models and operational vulnerabilities. Through systematic static analysis, runtime observation, and cryptographic examination, we uncovered a complex security landscape characterized by both sophisticated defensive mechanisms and critical vulnerabilities. Our findings reveal a dual-layer proprietary encryption system (designated FMX') that, while innovative in design, suffers from fundamental implementation flaws including the use of static cryptographic keys that enable offline configuration decryption. More significantly, we documented persistent telemetry connections transmitting detailed robot state information--including audio, visual, spatial, and actuator data--to external servers without explicit user consent or notification mechanisms. We operationalized a Cybersecurity AI agent on the Unitree G1 to map and prepare exploitation of its manufacturer's cloud infrastructure, illustrating how a compromised humanoid can escalate from covert data collection to active counter-offensive operations. We argue that securing humanoid robots requires a paradigm shift toward Cybersecurity AI (CAI) frameworks that can adapt to the unique challenges of physical-cyber convergence. This work contributes empirical evidence for developing robust security standards as humanoid robots transition from research curiosities to operational systems in critical domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint-Consistent Control of Task-Based and Kinematic RCM Constraints for Surgical Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14075v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) requires precise enforcement of the remote center of motion (RCM) constraint to ensure safe tool manipulation through a trocar. Achieving this constraint under dynamic and interactive conditions remains challenging, as existing control methods either lack robustness at the torque level or do not guarantee consistent RCM constraint satisfaction. This paper proposes a constraint-consistent torque controller that treats the RCM as a rheonomic holonomic constraint and embeds it into a projection-based inverse-dynamics framework. The method unifies task-level and kinematic formulations, enabling accurate tool-tip tracking while maintaining smooth and efficient torque behavior. The controller is validated both in simulation and on a RAMIS training platform, and is benchmarked against state-of-the-art approaches. Results show improved RCM constraint satisfaction, reduced required torque, and robust performance by improving joint torque smoothness through the consistency formulation under clinically relevant scenarios, including spiral trajectories, variable insertion depths, moving trocars, and human interaction. These findings demonstrate the potential of constraint-consistent torque control to enhance safety and reliability in surgical robotics.

Exploiting structural redundancy, MARS can be reconfigured into different formations to mitigate unit or rotor failures and maintain stable flight. Prior work on MARS self-reconfiguration has solely focused on maximizing controllability margins to tolerate a single rotor or unit fault for rectangular-shaped MARS. We propose TransforMARS, a general fault-tolerant reconfiguration framework that transforms arbitrarily shaped MARS under multiple rotor and unit faults while ensuring continuous in-air stability. Specifically, we develop algorithms to first identify and construct minimum controllable assemblies containing faulty units. We then plan feasible disassembly-assembly sequences to transport MARS units or subassemblies to form target configuration. Our approach enables more flexible and practical feasible reconfiguration. We validate TransforMARS in challenging arbitrarily shaped MARS configurations, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior works in both the capacity of handling diverse configurations and the number of faults tolerated.

We present Flowact, a proactive multimodal human-robot interaction architecture, working as an asynchronous endless loop of robot sensors into actuators and organized by two controllers, the Environment State Tracking (EST) and the Action Planner. The EST continuously collects and publishes a representation of the operative environment, ensuring a steady flow of perceptual data. This persistent perceptual flow is pivotal for our advanced Action Planner which orchestrates a collection of modular action subsystems, such as movement and speaking modules, governing their initiation or cessation based on the evolving environmental narrative. The EST employs a fusion of diverse sensory modalities to build a rich, real-time representation of the environment that is distributed to the Action Planner. This planner uses a decision-making framework to dynamically coordinate action modules, allowing them to respond proactively and coherently to changes in the environment. Through a series of real-world experiments, we exhibit the efficacy of the system in maintaining a continuous perception-action loop, substantially enhancing the responsiveness and adaptability of autonomous pro-active agents. The modular architecture of the action subsystems facilitates easy extensibility and adaptability to a broad spectrum of tasks and scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ICPRAM 2025</p></details> |

While significant advances have been made in recent years in the field of social robotics, there is still some way to go before we fully understand the factors that influence human trust in robots. This paper presents the results of a study into the first impressions created by a social robot's facial features, based on the hypothesis that a `babyface' engenders trust. By manipulating the back-projected face of a Furhat robot, the study confirms that eye shape and size have a significant impact on the perception of trustworthiness. The work thus contributes to an understanding of the design choices that need to be made when developing social robots so as to optimise the effectiveness of human-robot interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of TRUST 2025 (arXiv:2509.11402), a workshop at IEEE RO-MAN 2025: https://ro-man2025.org/</p></details> |

Given a textual instruction, our method generates short video demonstrations of candidate trajectories, executes them on the robot, and iteratively re-plans in response to failures. This approach enables robust recovery from execution errors. We evaluate PhysicalAgent across multiple perceptual modalities (egocentric, third-person, and simulated) and robotic embodiments (bimanual UR3, Unitree G1 humanoid, simulated GR1), comparing against state-of-the-art task-specific baselines. Experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving up to 83% success on human-familiar tasks. Physical trials reveal that first-attempt success is limited (20-30%), yet iterative correction increases overall success to 80% across platforms. These results highlight the potential of video-based generative reasoning for general-purpose robotic manipulation and underscore the importance of iterative execution for recovering from initial failures.

In this paper, we propose using Petri nets (PNs) to model contextual information for adaptive robot explanations. PNs provide a formal, graphical method for representing concurrent actions, causal dependencies, and system states, making them suitable for analyzing dynamic interactions between humans and robots. We demonstrate this approach through a scenario involving a robot that provides explanations based on contextual cues such as user attention and presence. Model analysis confirms key properties, including deadlock-freeness, context-sensitive reachability, boundedness, and liveness, showing the robustness and flexibility of PNs for designing and verifying context-adaptive explanations in human-robot interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of TRUST 2025 (arXiv:2509.11402), a workshop at IEEE RO-MAN 2025: https://www.ro-man2025.org/</p></details> |

A human-like form factor further enables the use of vast datasets of human-hand interactions. However, the primary bottleneck in dexterous manipulation lies not only in software but arguably even more in hardware. Robotic hands that approach human capabilities are often prohibitively expensive, bulky, or require enterprise-level maintenance, limiting their accessibility for broader research and practical applications. What if the research community could get started with reliable dexterous hands within a day? We present the open-source ORCA hand, a reliable and anthropomorphic 17-DoF tendon-driven robotic hand with integrated tactile sensors, fully assembled in less than eight hours and built for a material cost below 2,000 CHF. We showcase ORCA's key design features such as popping joints, auto-calibration, and tensioning systems that significantly reduce complexity while increasing reliability, accuracy, and robustness. We benchmark the ORCA hand across a variety of tasks, ranging from teleoperation and imitation learning to zero-shot sim-to-real reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate its durability, withstanding more than 10,000 continuous operation cycles - equivalent to approximately 20 hours - without hardware failure, the only constraint being the duration of the experiment itself.

| **[Behavior Foundation Model for Humanoid Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13780v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-body control (WBC) of humanoid robots has witnessed remarkable progress in skill versatility, enabling a wide range of applications such as locomotion, teleoperation, and motion tracking. Despite these achievements, existing WBC frameworks remain largely task-specific, relying heavily on labor-intensive reward engineering and demonstrating limited generalization across tasks and skills. These limitations hinder their response to arbitrary control modes and restrict their deployment in complex, real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we revisit existing WBC systems and identify a shared objective across diverse tasks: the generation of appropriate behaviors that guide the robot toward desired goal states. Building on this insight, we propose the Behavior Foundation Model (BFM), a generative model pretrained on large-scale behavioral datasets to capture broad, reusable behavioral knowledge for humanoid robots. BFM integrates a masked online distillation framework with a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to model behavioral distributions, thereby enabling flexible operation across diverse control modes and efficient acquisition of novel behaviors without retraining from scratch. Extensive experiments in both simulation and on a physical humanoid platform demonstrate that BFM generalizes robustly across diverse WBC tasks while rapidly adapting to new behaviors. These results establish BFM as a promising step toward a foundation model for general-purpose humanoid control.</p></details> |  |

In manufacturing processes, FFC insertion with robotic manipulators often requires laborious human-guided trajectory generation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a solution to automate this task without modeling complex properties of FFCs, the nondeterminism caused by the deformability of FFCs requires significant efforts and time on training. Moreover, training directly in a real environment is dangerous as industrial robots move fast and possess no safety measure. We propose an RL algorithm for FFC insertion that leverages a foundation model-based real-to-sim approach to reduce the training time and eliminate the risk of physical damages to robots and surroundings. Training is done entirely in simulation, allowing for random exploration without the risk of physical damages. Sim-to-real transfer is achieved through semantic segmentation masks which leave only those visual features relevant to the insertion tasks such as the geometric and spatial information of the cables and receptacles. To enhance generality, we use a foundation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). To eleminate human intervention, we employ a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to automate the initial prompting of SAM2 to find segmentation masks. In the experiments, our method exhibits zero-shot capabilities, which enable direct deployments to real environments without fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

We present a unified, lightweight closed-loop system built on an aligned multi-scale image tile hierarchy. Through hierarchical target-saliency fusion, it summarizes localized semantic contrast into a stable coarse-layer regional saliency that provides the target direction and indicates target visibility. This regional saliency supports visibility-aware heading maintenance through keyframe memory, saliency-weighted fusion of historical headings, and active search during temporary invisibility. The system avoids whole-image rescaling, enables deterministic bottom-up aggregation, supports zero-shot navigation, and runs efficiently on a mobile robot. Across simulation and real-world outdoor trials, the system detects semantic targets beyond 150m, maintains a correct heading through visibility changes with 82.6% probability, and improves overall task success by 17.5% compared with the SOTA methods, demonstrating robust ZSON toward distant and intermittently observable targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Page:...</summary><p>Page:https://tianlezeng.github.io/EzReal/</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Diffusion Policies with Projective Geometric Algebra for Efficient Robot Manipulation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05695v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies are a powerful paradigm for robot learning, but their training is often inefficient. A key reason is that networks must relearn fundamental spatial concepts, such as translations and rotations, from scratch for every new task. To alleviate this redundancy, we propose embedding geometric inductive biases directly into the network architecture using Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA). PGA provides a unified algebraic framework for representing geometric primitives and transformations, allowing neural networks to reason about spatial structure more effectively. In this paper, we introduce hPGA-DP, a novel hybrid diffusion policy that capitalizes on these benefits. Our architecture leverages the Projective Geometric Algebra Transformer (P-GATr) as a state encoder and action decoder, while employing established U-Net or Transformer-based modules for the core denoising process. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies in both simulated and real-world environments, we demonstrate that hPGA-DP significantly improves task performance and training efficiency. Notably, our hybrid approach achieves substantially faster convergence compared to both standard diffusion policies and architectures that rely solely on P-GATr.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPAR: Scalable LLM-based PDDL Domain Generation for Aerial Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13691v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the problem of automatic domain generation for the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) using Large Language Models (LLMs), with a particular focus on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tasks. Although PDDL is a widely adopted standard in robotic planning, manually designing domains for diverse applications such as surveillance, delivery, and inspection is labor-intensive and error-prone, which hinders adoption and real-world deployment. To address these challenges, we propose SPAR, a framework that leverages the generative capabilities of LLMs to automatically produce valid, diverse, and semantically accurate PDDL domains from natural language input. To this end, we first introduce a systematically formulated and validated UAV planning dataset, consisting of ground-truth PDDL domains and associated problems, each paired with detailed domain and action descriptions. Building on this dataset, we design a prompting framework that generates high-quality PDDL domains from language input. The generated domains are evaluated through syntax validation, executability, feasibility, and interpretability. Overall, this work demonstrates that LLMs can substantially accelerate the creation of complex planning domains, providing a reproducible dataset and evaluation pipeline that enables application experts without prior experience to leverage it for practical tasks and advance future research in aerial robotics and automated planning.</p></details> |  |

The established image-based world models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model (GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling potential of 3D world model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICCV 2025.

However, learning to ground language to behavior typically requires impractical amounts of diverse, language-annotated demonstrations collected on each target robot. In this work, we aim to separate the problem of what to accomplish from how to accomplish it, as the former can benefit from substantial amounts of external observation-only data, and only the latter depends on a specific robot embodiment. To this end, we propose Video-Language Critic, a reward model that can be trained on readily available cross-embodiment data using contrastive learning and a temporal ranking objective, and use it to score behavior traces from a separate actor. When trained on Open X-Embodiment data, our reward model enables 2x more sample-efficient policy training on Meta-World tasks than a sparse reward only, despite a significant domain gap. Using in-domain data but in a challenging task generalization setting on Meta-World, we further demonstrate more sample-efficient training than is possible with prior language-conditioned reward models that are either trained with binary classification, use static images, or do not leverage the temporal information present in video data.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages in the main text, 22 pages including references and supplementary materials. 3 figures and 3 tables in the main text, 6 figures and 3 tables in supplementary materials</p></details> |
| **[Dense-Jump Flow Matching with Non-Uniform Time Scheduling for Robotic Policies: Mitigating Multi-Step Inference Degradation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13574v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching has emerged as a competitive framework for learning high-quality generative policies in robotics; however, we find that generalisation arises and saturates early along the flow trajectory, in accordance with recent findings in the literature. We further observe that increasing the number of Euler integration steps during inference counter-intuitively and universally degrades policy performance. We attribute this to (i) additional, uniformly spaced integration steps oversample the late-time region, thereby constraining actions towards the training trajectories and reducing generalisation; and (ii) the learned velocity field becoming non-Lipschitz as integration time approaches 1, causing instability. To address these issues, we propose a novel policy that utilises non-uniform time scheduling (e.g., U-shaped) during training, which emphasises both early and late temporal stages to regularise policy training, and a dense-jump integration schedule at inference, which uses a single-step integration to replace the multi-step integration beyond a jump point, to avoid unstable areas around 1. Essentially, our policy is an efficient one-step learner that still pushes forward performance through multi-step integration, yielding up to 23.7% performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines across diverse robotic tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework that integrates a pre-trained human motion prior with a neural signed distance field (NSDF) representation to achieve robust whole-body embracing. Our method leverages a teacher-student architecture to distill large-scale human motion data, generating kinematically natural and physically feasible whole-body motion patterns. This facilitates coordinated control across the arms and torso, enabling stable multi-contact interactions that enhance the robustness in manipulation and also the load capacity. The embedded NSDF further provides accurate and continuous geometric perception, improving contact awareness throughout long-horizon tasks. We thoroughly evaluate the approach through comprehensive simulations and real-world experiments. The results demonstrate improved adaptability to diverse shapes and sizes of objects and also successful sim-to-real transfer. These indicate that the proposed framework offers an effective and practical solution for multi-contact and long-horizon WBM tasks of humanoid robots.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong high-level reasoning capabilities, the lack of safety guarantees limits their direct use in critical decision-making. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical optimization framework that integrates LLMs into the decision loop for multi-robot target tracking in dynamic and hazardous environments. Rather than generating control actions directly, LLMs are used to generate task configuration and adjust parameters in a bi-level task allocation and planning problem. We formulate multi-robot coordination for tracking tasks as a bi-level optimization problem, with LLMs to reason about potential hazards in the environment and the status of the robot team and modify both the inner and outer levels of the optimization. This hierarchical approach enables real-time adjustments to the robots' behavior. Additionally, a human supervisor can offer broad guidance and assessments to address unexpected dangers, model mismatches, and performance issues arising from local minima. We validate our proposed framework in both simulation and real-world experiments with comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its effectiveness and showcasing its capability for safe LLM integration for multi-robot systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic-Enhanced Cross-Modal Place Recognition for Robust Robot Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13474v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring accurate localization of robots in environments without GPS capability is a challenging task. Visual Place Recognition (VPR) techniques can potentially achieve this goal, but existing RGB-based methods are sensitive to changes in illumination, weather, and other seasonal changes. Existing cross-modal localization methods leverage the geometric properties of RGB images and 3D LiDAR maps to reduce the sensitivity issues highlighted above. Currently, state-of-the-art methods struggle in complex scenes, fine-grained or high-resolution matching, and situations where changes can occur in viewpoint. In this work, we introduce a framework we call Semantic-Enhanced Cross-Modal Place Recognition (SCM-PR) that combines high-level semantics utilizing RGB images for robust localization in LiDAR maps. Our proposed method introduces: a VMamba backbone for feature extraction of RGB images; a Semantic-Aware Feature Fusion (SAFF) module for using both place descriptors and segmentation masks; LiDAR descriptors that incorporate both semantics and geometry; and a cross-modal semantic attention mechanism in NetVLAD to improve matching. Incorporating the semantic information also was instrumental in designing a Multi-View Semantic-Geometric Matching and a Semantic Consistency Loss, both in a contrastive learning framework. Our experimental work on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets show that SCM-PR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other cross-modal place recognition methods.</p></details> |  |

However, their development is limited by the lack of realistic training and test environments: Real data is difficult to collect due to ethical constraints and patient safety concerns, and developing autonomy algorithms requires realistic imaging and physical feedback. We present ROOM (Realistic Optical Observation in Medicine), a comprehensive simulation framework designed for generating photorealistic bronchoscopy training data. By leveraging patient CT scans, our pipeline renders multi-modal sensor data including RGB images with realistic noise and light specularities, metric depth maps, surface normals, optical flow and point clouds at medically relevant scales. We validate the data generated by ROOM in two canonical tasks for medical robotics -- multi-view pose estimation and monocular depth estimation, demonstrating diverse challenges that state-of-the-art methods must overcome to transfer to these medical settings. Furthermore, we show that the data produced by ROOM can be used to fine-tune existing depth estimation models to overcome these challenges, also enabling other downstream applications such as navigation. We expect that ROOM will enable large-scale data generation across diverse patient anatomies and procedural scenarios that are challenging to capture in clinical settings.

Recently, various attacks against such robotic policies have been proposed, with backdoor attacks drawing considerable attention for their high stealth and strong persistence capabilities. However, existing backdoor efforts are limited to simulators and suffer from physical-world realization. To address this, we propose \textit{TrojanRobot}, a highly stealthy and broadly effective robotic backdoor attack in the physical world. Specifically, we introduce a module-poisoning approach by embedding a backdoor module into the modular robotic policy, enabling backdoor control over the policy's visual perception module thereby backdooring the entire robotic policy. Our vanilla implementation leverages a backdoor-finetuned VLM to serve as the backdoor module. To enhance its generalization in physical environments, we propose a prime implementation, leveraging the LVLM-as-a-backdoor paradigm and developing three types of prime attacks, \ie, \textit{permutation}, \textit{stagnation}, and \textit{intentional} attacks, thus achieving finer-grained backdoors. Extensive experiments on the UR3e manipulator with 18 task instructions using robotic policies based on four VLMs demonstrate the broad effectiveness and physical-world stealth of TrojanRobot. Our attack's video demonstrations are available via a github link https://trojanrobot.github.io.</p></details> |  |

A two-layer framework is proposed to safely achieve a desired ICP waveform modulation. First, a model predictive controller (MPC) with a disturbance observer is used for offset-free tracking of the system's motor position reference trajectory under safety constraints. Second, to address the unknown nonlinear dependence of ICP on the motor position, we employ a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm used for online learning of a motor position reference trajectory that yields the desired ICP modulation. The framework is experimentally validated using a test bench with a brain phantom that replicates realistic ICP dynamics in vitro. Compared to a previously employed proportional-integral-derivative controller, the MPC reduces mean and maximum motor position reference tracking errors by 83 % and 73 %, respectively. In less than 20 iterations, the BO algorithm learns a motor position reference trajectory that yields an ICP waveform with the desired mean and amplitude.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering Multi-Robot Cooperation via Sequential World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13095v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has shown significant potential in robotics due to its high sample efficiency and planning capability. However, extending MBRL to multi-robot cooperation remains challenging due to the complexity of joint dynamics. To address this, we propose the Sequential World Model (SeqWM), a novel framework that integrates the sequential paradigm into model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning. SeqWM employs independent, sequentially structured agent-wise world models to decompose complex joint dynamics. Latent rollouts and decision-making are performed through sequential communication, where each agent generates its future trajectory and plans its actions based on the predictions of its predecessors. This design enables explicit intention sharing, enhancing cooperative performance, and reduces communication overhead to linear complexity. Results in challenging simulated environments (Bi-DexHands and Multi-Quad) show that SeqWM outperforms existing state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines in both overall performance and sample efficiency, while exhibiting advanced cooperative behaviors such as predictive adaptation and role division. Furthermore, SeqWM has been success fully deployed on physical quadruped robots, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world multi-robot systems.

| **[Practical Handling of Dynamic Environments in Decentralised Multi-Robot Patrol](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13069v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Persistent monitoring using robot teams is of interest in fields such as security, environmental monitoring, and disaster recovery. Performing such monitoring in a fully on-line decentralised fashion has significant potential advantages for robustness, adaptability, and scalability of monitoring solutions, including, in principle, the capacity to effectively adapt in real-time to a changing environment. We examine this through the lens of multi-robot patrol, in which teams of patrol robots must persistently minimise time between visits to points of interest, within environments where traversability of routes is highly dynamic. These dynamics must be observed by patrol agents and accounted for in a fully decentralised on-line manner. In this work, we present a new method of monitoring and adjusting for environment dynamics in a decentralised multi-robot patrol team. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms realistic baselines in highly dynamic scenarios, and also investigate dynamic scenarios in which explicitly accounting for environment dynamics may be unnecessary or impractical.</p></details> |  |

Compared to other automatic docking methods, visual docking methods offer higher precision and lower deployment costs, making them an efficient and promising choice for this task. However, visual docking methods impose strict requirements on the robot's initial position at the start of the docking process. To overcome the limitations of current vision-based methods, we propose an innovative end-to-end visual docking method named DVDP(direct visual docking policy). This approach requires only a binocular RGB-D camera installed on the mobile robot to directly output the robot's docking path, achieving end-to-end automatic docking. Furthermore, we have collected a large-scale dataset of mobile robot visual automatic docking dataset through a combination of virtual and real environments using the Unity 3D platform and actual mobile robot setups. We developed a series of evaluation metrics to quantify the performance of the end-to-end visual docking method. Extensive experiments, including benchmarks against leading perception backbones adapted into our framework, demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance. Finally, real-world deployment on the SCOUT Mini confirmed DVDP's efficacy, with our model generating smooth, feasible docking trajectories that meet physical constraints and reach the target pose.</p></details> |  |

To this end, digital twins offer a valuable solution for OOD detection. Thus, we present a digital twin-based approach for OOD detection (ODiSAR) in SARs. ODiSAR uses a Transformer-based digital twin to forecast SAR states and employs reconstruction error and Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty quantification. By combining reconstruction error with predictive variance, the digital twin effectively detects OOD behaviors, even in previously unseen conditions. The digital twin also includes an explainability layer that links potential OOD to specific SAR states, offering insights for self-adaptation. We evaluated ODiSAR by creating digital twins of two industrial robots: one navigating an office environment, and another performing maritime ship navigation. In both cases, ODiSAR forecasts SAR behaviors (i.e., robot trajectories and vessel motion) and proactively detects OOD events. Our results showed that ODiSAR achieved high detection performance -- up to 98\% AUROC, 96\% TNR@TPR95, and 95\% F1-score -- while providing interpretable insights to support self-adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Currently, commonly used evaluation metrics lack the ability to quantify how cooperative an agent behaves in interaction with humans. Concretely, in a simple frontal approach scenario, no metric specifically captures if both agents cooperate or if one agent stays on collision course and the other agent is forced to evade. To address this limitation, we propose two new metrics, a conflict intensity metric and the responsibility metric. Together, these metrics are capable of evaluating the quality of human-robot interactions by showing how much a given algorithm has contributed to reducing a conflict and which agent actually took responsibility of the resolution. This work aims to contribute to the development of a comprehensive and standardized evaluation methodology for SRN, ultimately enhancing the safety, efficiency, and social acceptance of robots in human-centric environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at 2025 IEEE Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) Workshop: Advances in Social Navigation: Planning, HRI and Beyond</p></details> |

As its typical physical embodiment, humanoid robots have shown great promise through robot learning algorithms in recent years. In this study, a hardware platform, including humanoid robot and exoskeleton-style teleoperation cabin, was developed to realize intuitive remote manipulation and efficient collection of anthropomorphic action data. To improve the perception representation of humanoid robot, an imitation learning framework, termed Frequency-Enhanced Wavelet-based Transformer (FEWT), was proposed, which consists of two primary modules: Frequency-Enhanced Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (FE-EMA) and Time-Series Discrete Wavelet Transform (TS-DWT). By combining multi-scale wavelet decomposition with the residual network, FE-EMA can dynamically fuse features from both cross-spatial and frequency-domain. This fusion is able to capture feature information across various scales effectively, thereby enhancing model robustness. Experimental performance demonstrates that FEWT improves the success rate of the state-of-the-art algorithm (Action Chunking with Transformers, ACT baseline) by up to 30% in simulation and by 6-12% in real-world.</p></details> |  |

In the SRN context, such interactions often relate to resolving conflicts between two or more agents. Correspondingly, the shares to which agents contribute to the resolution of such conflicts are important. This paper builds on recent work, which proposed a Responsibility metric capturing such shares. We extend this framework in two directions: First, we model the conflict buildup phase by introducing a time normalization. Second, we propose the related Engagement metric, which captures how the agents' actions intensify a conflict. In a comprehensive series of simulated scenarios with dyadic, group and crowd interactions, we show that the metrics carry meaningful information about the cooperative resolution of conflicts in interactions. They can be used to assess behavior quality and foresightedness. We extensively discuss applicability, design choices and limitations of the proposed metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review for 2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

Recent Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approaches typically formulate ARE as a sequential decision-making problem defined on a collision-free informative graph. However, these methods often demonstrate limited reasoning ability over graph-structured data. Moreover, due to the insufficient consideration of robot motion, the resulting RL policies are generally optimized to minimize travel distance, while neglecting time efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRATE, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approach that leverages a Graph Transformer to effectively capture both local structure patterns and global contextual dependencies of the informative graph, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning capability across the entire environment. In addition, we deploy a Kalman filter to smooth the waypoint outputs, ensuring that the resulting path is kinodynamically feasible for the robot to follow. Experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits better exploration efficiency (up to 21.5% in distance and 21.3% in time to complete exploration) than state-of-the-art conventional and learning-based baselines in various simulation benchmarks. We also validate our planner in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We argue that they benefit robot navigation and scene understanding, by directly encoding privileged information on actions, spatial regions, and relations. Interpreting signs in open-world settings remains a challenge owing to the complexity of scenes and signs, but recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) make this feasible. To advance progress in this area, we introduce the task of navigational sign understanding which parses locations and associated directions from signs. We offer a benchmark for this task, proposing appropriate evaluation metrics and curating a test set capturing signs with varying complexity and design across diverse public spaces, from hospitals to shopping malls to transport hubs. We also provide a baseline approach using VLMs, and demonstrate their promise on navigational sign understanding.

This study addresses the challenging problem of determining which robot should be assigned to which part of a task when each robot possesses different situational on-site knowledge-specifically, spatial concepts learned from the area designated to it by the user. We propose a task planning framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and spatial concepts to decompose natural language instructions into subtasks and allocate them to multiple robots. We designed a novel few-shot prompting strategy that enables LLMs to infer required objects from ambiguous commands and decompose them into appropriate subtasks. In our experiments, the proposed method achieved 47/50 successful assignments, outperforming random (28/50) and commonsense-based assignment (26/50). Furthermore, we conducted qualitative evaluations using two actual mobile manipulators.

| **[Multi-objective task allocation for electric harvesting robots: a hierarchical route reconstruction approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11025v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing labor costs in agriculture have accelerated the adoption of multi-robot systems for orchard harvesting. However, efficiently coordinating these systems is challenging due to the complex interplay between makespan and energy consumption, particularly under practical constraints like load-dependent speed variations and battery limitations. This paper defines the multi-objective agricultural multi-electrical-robot task allocation (AMERTA) problem, which systematically incorporates these often-overlooked real-world constraints. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid hierarchical route reconstruction algorithm (HRRA) that integrates several innovative mechanisms, including a hierarchical encoding structure, a dual-phase initialization method, task sequence optimizers, and specialized route reconstruction operators. Extensive experiments on 45 test instances demonstrate HRRA's superior performance against seven state-of-the-art algorithms. Statistical analysis, including the Wilcoxon signed-rank and Friedman tests, empirically validates HRRA's competitiveness and its unique ability to explore previously inaccessible regions of the solution space. In general, this research contributes to the theoretical understanding of multi-robot coordination by offering a novel problem formulation and an effective algorithm, thereby also providing practical insights for agricultural automation.</p></details> |  |

Prior work has explored self-reflection in Large Language Models (LLMs) for task planning error correction; however, existing methods are constrained by inflexible self-reflection mechanisms that limit their effectiveness. Motivated by these limitations and inspired by human cognitive adaptation, we propose the Flexible Constructivism Reflection Framework (FCRF), a novel Mentor-Actor architecture that enables LLMs to perform flexible self-reflection based on task difficulty, while constructively integrating historical valuable experience with failure lessons. We evaluated FCRF on diverse domestic tasks through simulation in AlfWorld and physical deployment in the real-world environment. Experimental results demonstrate that FCRF significantly improves overall performance and self-reflection flexibility in complex long-horizon robotic tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, IROS 2025</p></details> |

To ensure an effective and comfortable dressing experience, the robot must be able to handle challenging deformable garments, apply appropriate forces, and adapt to limb movements throughout the dressing process. Prior work often makes simplifying assumptions -- such as static human limbs during dressing -- which limits real-world applicability. In this work, we develop a robot-assisted dressing system capable of handling partial observations with visual occlusions, as well as robustly adapting to arm motions during the dressing process. Given a policy trained in simulation with partial observations, we propose a method to fine-tune it in the real world using a small amount of data and multi-modal feedback from vision and force sensing, to further improve the policy's adaptability to arm motions and enhance safety. We evaluate our method in simulation with simplified articulated human meshes and in a real world human study with 12 participants across 264 dressing trials. Our policy successfully dresses two long-sleeve everyday garments onto the participants while being adaptive to various kinds of arm motions, and greatly outperforms prior baselines in terms of task completion and user feedback.

As resilience, robustness, and well-being are required in anti-fragile manufacturing and human-centric societal tasks, an autonomous anticipation and adaption to thermal saturation and burns due to motors overheating become instrumental for human safety and robot availability. Robots are thereby expected to self-sustain their performance and deliver user experience, in addition to communicating their capability to other agents in advance to ensure fully automated thermally feasible tasks, and prolong their lifetime without human intervention. However, the traditional robot shutdown, when facing an imminent thermal saturation, inhibits productivity in factories and comfort in the society, while cooling strategies are hard to implement after the robot acquisition. In this work, smart digital twins endowed with generative AI, i.e., variational autoencoders, are leveraged to manage thermally anomalous and generate uncritical robot states. The notion of thermal difficulty is derived from the reconstruction error of variational autoencoders. A robot can use this score to predict, anticipate, and share the thermal feasibility of desired motion profiles to meet requirements from emerging applications in Industry 6.0 and Society 6.0.</p></details> | <details><summary>$\cop...</summary><p>$\copyright$ 2025 the authors.

The method uses a two stage curriculum: (1) a simple distance-visibility rule auto-labels a large dataset at low cost; and (2) a smaller set of high fidelity simulation trials refines the model to match true grasp outcomes. A PointNet++ style point cloud encoder with an MLP scores dense grids of candidate poses, enabling rapid online selection without full task-and-motion optimization. In simulation and on a real mobile manipulator, GBPP outperforms proximity and geometry only baselines, choosing safer and more reachable stances and degrading gracefully when wrong. The results offer a practical recipe for data efficient, geometry aware base placement: use inexpensive heuristics for coverage, then calibrate with targeted simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper needs major revision</p></details> |

However, it demands robustness against communication challenges like packet loss and limited bandwidth. While prior works have introduced various mechanisms to mitigate communication disruptions, performance degradation still occurs under extremely low communication success rates. This paper presents UDON, a real-time multi-agent neural implicit mapping framework that introduces a novel uncertainty-weighted distributed optimization to achieve high-quality mapping under severe communication deterioration. The uncertainty weighting prioritizes more reliable portions of the map, while the distributed optimization isolates and penalizes mapping disagreement between individual pairs of communicating agents. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets and real-world robot hardware. We demonstrate that UDON significantly outperforms existing baselines, maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions and consistent scene representations even under extreme communication degradation (as low as 1% success rate).</p></details> |  |

Existing safety filters often assume full observability, limiting their applicability in real-world tasks. We propose a physics-based safety filtering scheme that leverages high-fidelity simulation to assess control policies under uncertainty in world parameters. The method combines dense rollout with nominal parameters and parallelizable sparse re-evaluation at critical state-transitions, quantified through generalized factors of safety for stable grasping and actuator limits, and targeted uncertainty reduction through probing actions. We demonstrate the approach in a simulated bimanual manipulation task with uncertain object mass and friction, showing that unsafe trajectories can be identified and filtered efficiently. Our results highlight physics-based sparse safety evaluation as a scalable strategy for safe robotic manipulation under uncertainty.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

To address these limitations, we present PerchMobi^3, a quad-fan, negative-pressure, air-ground-wall robot that implements a propulsion-adhesion power-reuse mechanism. By repurposing four ducted fans to simultaneously provide aerial thrust and negative-pressure adhesion, and integrating them with four actively driven wheels, PerchMobi^3 eliminates dedicated pumps while maintaining a lightweight and compact design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quad-fan prototype to demonstrate functional power reuse for multi-modal locomotion. A modeling and control framework enables coordinated operation across ground, wall, and aerial domains with fan-assisted transitions. The feasibility of the design is validated through a comprehensive set of experiments covering ground driving, payload-assisted wall climbing, aerial flight, and cross-mode transitions, demonstrating robust adaptability across locomotion scenarios. These results highlight the potential of PerchMobi^3 as a novel design paradigm for multi-modal robotic mobility, paving the way for future extensions toward autonomous and application-oriented deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Towards Bio-Inspired Robotic Trajectory Planning via Self-Supervised RNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02171v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning in robotics is understood as generating a sequence of joint configurations that will lead a robotic agent, or its manipulator, from an initial state to the desired final state, thus completing a manipulation task while considering constraints like robot kinematics and the environment. Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks requiring adaptive solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

Inspired by mudskippers, amphibious animals that naturally adjust their tail morphology and movement jointly to navigate such environments, we investigate how tail design and control can jointly enhance flipper-driven locomotion on granular media. Using a bio-inspired robot modeled after the mudskipper, we experimentally compared locomotion performance between idle and actively oscillating tail configurations. Tail oscillation increased robot speed by 67% and reduced body drag by 46%. Shear force measurements revealed that this improvement was enabled by tail oscillation fluidizing the substrate, thereby reducing resistance. Additionally, tail morphology strongly influenced the oscillation strategy: designs with larger horizontal surface areas leveraged the oscillation-reduced shear resistance more effectively by limiting insertion depth. Based on these findings, we present a design principle to inform tail action selection based on substrate strength and tail morphology. Our results offer new insights into tail design and control for improving robot locomotion on deformable substrates, with implications for agricultural robotics, search and rescue, and environmental exploration.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we contribute a workflow that integrates natural language, 3D generative AI, geometric processing, and discrete robotic assembly. The system discretizes the AI-generated geometry and modifies it to meet fabrication constraints such as component count, overhangs, and connectivity to ensure feasible physical assembly.

| **[Geometric Red-Teaming for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12379v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard evaluation protocols in robotic manipulation typically assess policy performance over curated, in-distribution test sets, offering limited insight into how systems fail under plausible variation. We introduce Geometric Red-Teaming (GRT), a red-teaming framework that probes robustness through object-centric geometric perturbations, automatically generating CrashShapes -- structurally valid, user-constrained mesh deformations that trigger catastrophic failures in pre-trained manipulation policies. The method integrates a Jacobian field-based deformation model with a gradient-free, simulator-in-the-loop optimization strategy. Across insertion, articulation, and grasping tasks, GRT consistently discovers deformations that collapse policy performance, revealing brittle failure modes missed by static benchmarks. By combining task-level policy rollouts with constraint-aware shape exploration, we aim to build a general purpose framework for structured, object-centric robustness evaluation in robotic manipulation. We additionally show that fine-tuning on individual CrashShapes, a process we refer to as blue-teaming, improves task success by up to 60 percentage points on those shapes, while preserving performance on the original object, demonstrating the utility of red-teamed geometries for targeted policy refinement. Finally, we validate both red-teaming and blue-teaming results with a real robotic arm, observing that simulated CrashShapes reduce task success from 90% to as low as 22.5%, and that blue-teaming recovers performance to up to 90% on the corresponding real-world geometry -- closely matching simulation outcomes.

Similarly, numerous small terrestrial animals move through cluttered terrain where 3-D, multi-component obstacles like grass, shrubs, vines, and leaf litter resist motion, but it is unknown whether their body shape plays a major role in traversal. Few ground vehicles or terrestrial robots have used body shape to effectively traverse cluttered terrain. Here, we challenged forest-floor-dwelling discoid cockroaches possessing a thin, rounded body to traverse tall, narrowly spaced, vertical, grass-like compliant beams. Animals displayed high traversal performance (79 +/- 12% probability and 3.4 +/- 0.7 s time). Although we observed diverse traversal strategies, cockroaches primarily (48 +/- 9 % probability) used a novel roll maneuver, allowing them to rapidly traverse obstacle gaps narrower than half body width (2.0 +/- 0.5 s traversal time). Reduction of body roundness by addition of artificial shells nearly inhibited roll maneuvers and decreased traversal performance. Inspired by this discovery, we added a thin, rounded exoskeletal shell to a legged robot with a nearly cuboidal body, common to many existing terrestrial robots. Without adding sensory feedback or changing the open-loop control, the rounded shell enabled the robot to traverse beam obstacles with gaps narrower than shell width via body roll. Terradynamically streamlined shapes can reduce terrain resistance and enhance traversability by assisting effective body reorientation via distributed mechanical feedback. Our findings highlight the need to consider body shape to improve robot mobility in real-world terrain often filled with clutter, and to develop better locomotor-ground contact models to understand interaction with complex terrain.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We accomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a 360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze on top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the hand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct action predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements a foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small compute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable fixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors. We evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring manipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate manipulation over large workspaces with a single camera.

For example, such knowledge directs an agent to grasp a knife by the handle for cutting or by the blade for safe handover. While existing approaches have made notable progress, affordance research still faces three key challenges: data scarcity, poor generalization, and real-world deployment. Specifically, there is a lack of large-scale affordance datasets with precise segmentation maps, existing models struggle to generalize across different domains or novel object and affordance classes, and little work demonstrates deployability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we address these issues by proposing a complete affordance learning system that (1) takes in egocentric videos and outputs precise affordance annotations without human labeling, (2) leverages geometric information and vision foundation models to improve generalization, and (3) introduces a framework that facilitates affordance-oriented robotic manipulation such as tool grasping and robot-to-human tool handover. Experimental results show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art by 13.8% in mIoU, and the framework achieves 77.1% successful grasping among 179 trials, including evaluations on seen, unseen classes, and cluttered scenes.

Gesture recognition offers an intuitive control method that does not require physical contact with devices and can be implemented using various sensing technologies. Wireless solutions are particularly flexible and minimally invasive. While camera-based vision systems are commonly used, they often raise privacy concerns and can struggle in complex or poorly lit environments. In contrast, radar sensing preserves privacy, is robust to occlusions and lighting, and provides rich spatial data such as distance, relative velocity, and angle. We present a gesture-controlled robotic arm using mm-wave radar for reliable, contactless motion recognition. Nine gestures are recognized and mapped to real-time commands with precision. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate the system practicality, performance and reliability for gesture-based robotic manipulation. Unlike prior work that treats gesture recognition and robotic control separately, our system unifies both into a real-time pipeline for seamless, contactless human-robot interaction.</p></details> |  |

We study design choices that most affect stability and performance for diffusion-transformer policies trained on heterogeneous, multimodal robot data, and introduce Tenma, a lightweight diffusion-transformer for bi-manual arm control. Tenma integrates multiview RGB, proprioception, and language via a cross-embodiment normalizer that maps disparate state/action spaces into a shared latent space; a Joint State-Time encoder for temporally aligned observation learning with inference speed boosts; and a diffusion action decoder optimized for training stability and learning capacity. Across benchmarks and under matched compute, Tenma achieves an average success rate of 88.95% in-distribution and maintains strong performance under object and scene shifts, substantially exceeding baseline policies whose best in-distribution average is 18.12%. Despite using moderate data scale, Tenma delivers robust manipulation and generalization, indicating the great potential for multimodal and cross-embodiment learning strategies for further augmenting the capacity of transformer-based imitation learning policies.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Although Programming by Demonstration (PbD) offers a more accessible alternative, intuitive interfaces for robot control and demonstration collection remain challenging. To address this, we propose an Augmented Reality (AR)-enhanced robot teleoperation system that integrates AR-based control with spatial point cloud rendering, enabling intuitive, contact-free demonstrations. This approach allows operators to control robots remotely without entering the workspace or using conventional tools like the teach pendant. The proposed system is generally applicable and has been demonstrated on ABB robot platforms, specifically validated with the IRB 1200 industrial robot and the GoFa 5 collaborative robot. A user study evaluates the impact of real-time environmental perception, specifically with and without point cloud rendering, on task completion accuracy, efficiency, and user confidence. Results indicate that enhanced perception significantly improves task performance by 28% and enhances user experience, as reflected by a 12% increase in the System Usability Scale (SUS) score.

Inspired by ontogenetic scaling of muscle power in biology, we propose Scaling Mechanical Output over Lifetime (SMOL), a novel curriculum that dynamically modulates robot actuator strength to mimic natural variations in power-to-weight ratio during growth and ageing. Integrating SMOL into the MAP-Elites quality-diversity framework, we vary the torque in standard robotics tasks to mimic the evolution of strength in animals as they grow up and as their body changes. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that the SMOL schedule consistently elevates both performance and diversity of locomotion behaviours across varied control scenarios, by allowing agents to leverage advantageous physics early on to discover skills that act as stepping stones when they reach their final standard body properties. Based on studies of the total power output in humans, we also implement the SMOL-Human schedule that models isometric body variations due to non-linear changes like puberty, and study its impact on robotics locomotion.</p></details> |  |

We employ a smart edge sensor network to provide global observations, future predictions, and goal information to integrate anticipatory behavior for the control of a mobile manipulation robot.

To explore alternatives, we conducted two co-design workshops with 23 participants, who engaged with a modular robot co-design framework. Using components we provided as building blocks, participants combined, removed, and invented modules to envision how modular robots could accompany them from childhood through adulthood and into older adulthood. The participants' designs illustrate how modularity (a) enables personalization through open-ended configuration, (b) adaptability across shifting life-stage needs, and (c) sustainability through repair, reuse, and continuity. We therefore derive design principles that establish modularity as a foundation for lifespan-oriented human-robot interaction. This work reframes modular robotics as a flexible and expressive co-design approach, supporting robots that evolve with people, rather than static products optimized for single moments or contexts of use.</p></details> | Pre-print |
| **[AssemMate: Graph-Based LLM for Robotic Assembly Assistance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11617v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based robotic assembly assistance has gained significant research attention. It requires the injection of domain-specific knowledge to guide the assembly process through natural language interaction with humans. Despite some progress, existing methods represent knowledge in the form of natural language text. Due to the long context and redundant content, they struggle to meet the robots' requirements for real-time and precise reasoning. In order to bridge this gap, we present AssemMate, which utilizes the graph\textemdash a concise and accurate form of knowledge representation\textemdash as input. This graph-based LLM enables knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), supporting human-robot interaction and assembly task planning for specific products. Beyond interactive QA, AssemMate also supports sensing stacked scenes and executing grasping to assist with assembly. Specifically, a self-supervised Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) encodes knowledge graph entities and relations into a latent space and aligns them with LLM's representation, enabling the LLM to understand graph information. In addition, a vision-enhanced strategy is employed to address stacked scenes in grasping. Through training and evaluation, AssemMate outperforms existing methods, achieving 6.4\% higher accuracy, 3 times faster inference, and 28 times shorter context length, while demonstrating strong generalization ability on random graphs. And our approach further demonstrates superiority through robotic grasping experiments in both simulated and real-world settings.

However, current state-of-the-art continuum robots can only achieve real-time task-space control (i.e., tip control) but not whole-shape control, mainly due to the high computational cost from its infinite degrees of freedom. In this paper, we present a data-driven Koopman operator-based approach for the shape control of simulated multi-segment tendon-driven soft continuum robots with the Kirchhoff rod model. Using data collected from these simulated soft robots, we conduct a per-segment projection scheme on the state of the robots allowing for the identification of control-affine Koopman models that are an order of magnitude more accurate than without the projection scheme. Using these learned Koopman models, we use a linear model predictive control (MPC) to control the robots to a collection of target shapes of varying complexity. Our method realizes computationally efficient closed-loop control, and demonstrates the feasibility of real-time shape control for soft robots. We envision this work can pave the way for practical shape control of soft continuum robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages (+2 pages of references), 8 figures</p></details> |

However, Koopman operator-based models for soft robots are very high dimensional and require considerable amounts of data to properly resolve. Inspired by physics-informed techniques from machine learning, we present a novel physics-informed Koopman operator identification method that improves simulation accuracy for small dataset sizes. Through Strang splitting, the method takes advantage of both continuous and discrete Koopman operator approximation to obtain information both from trajectory and phase space data. The method is validated on a tendon-driven soft robotic arm, showing orders of magnitude improvement over standard methods in terms of the shape error. We envision this method can significantly reduce the data requirement of Koopman operators for systems with partially known physical models, and thus reduce the cost of obtaining data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted and accepted to ICRA 2025.

However, such environments often pose risks to electronic components as well. To overcome this, various approaches have been developed, including autonomous mobile robots without electronics, hydraulic remotely actuated mobile robots, and long-reach robot arms driven by wires. Among these, electronics-free autonomous robots cannot make complex decisions, while hydraulically actuated mobile robots and wire-driven robot arms are used in harsh environments such as nuclear power plants. Mobile robots offer greater reach and obstacle avoidance than robot arms, and wire mechanisms offer broader environmental applicability than hydraulics. However, wire-driven systems have not been used for remote actuation of mobile robots. In this study, we propose a novel mechanism called Remote Wire Drive that enables remote actuation of mobile robots via wires. This mechanism is a series connection of decoupled joints, a mechanism used in wire-driven robot arms, adapted for power transmission. We experimentally validated its feasibility by actuating a wire-driven quadruped robot, which we also developed in this study, through Remote Wire Drive.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted Humanoids2025, website - https://hatofly.github.io/remote-wire-driven-quadruped/</p></details> |

While teleoperation is widely used, it is slow, delay-sensitive, and poorly suited for dynamic tasks. In contrast, human videos provide a natural way for data collection without specialized hardware, though they pose challenges on robot learning due to viewpoint variations and embodiment gaps. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that transfers tool-use knowledge from humans to robots. To improve the policy's robustness to viewpoint variations, we use two RGB cameras to reconstruct 3D scenes and apply Gaussian splatting for novel view synthesis. We reduce the embodiment gap using segmented observations and tool-centric, task-space actions to achieve embodiment-invariant visuomotor policy learning. We demonstrate our framework's effectiveness across a diverse suite of tool-use tasks, where our learned policy shows strong generalization and robustness to human perturbations, camera motion, and robot base movement. Our method achieves a 71\% improvement in task success over teleoperation-based diffusion policies and dramatically reduces data collection time by 77\% and 41\% compared to teleoperation and the state-of-the-art interface, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025.

However, executing such manoeuvres requires precise temporal coordination and complex agent-environment interactions. Moreover, legged locomotion is inherently more prone to slippage and tripping, and the classical approach of modeling such cases to design a robust controller thus quickly becomes impractical. In contrast, reinforcement learning offers a compelling solution by enabling optimal control through trial and error. We present a generalist reinforcement learning algorithm for quadrupedal agents in dynamic motion scenarios. The learned policy rivals state-of-the-art specialist policies trained using a mixture of experts approach, while using only 25% as many agents during training. Our experiments also highlight the key components of the generalist locomotion policy and the primary factors contributing to its success.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18h25azbCFfPF4fhSsRfxKrnZo3dPKs_j?usp=sharing</p></details> |

Existing approaches often struggle to balance collecting high-quality observations from multiple view angles and avoiding unnecessary repetitive traversal. To fill this gap, we propose a complete system combining mapping and planning. We first redefine the task as completing both geometric coverage and semantic viewpoint observation. We then manage semantic and geometric viewpoints separately and propose a novel Priority-driven Decoupled Local Sampler to generate local viewpoint sets. This enables explicit multi-view semantic inspection and voxel coverage without unnecessary repetition. Building on this, we develop a hierarchical planner to ensure efficient global coverage. In addition, we propose a Safe Aggressive Exploration State Machine, which allows aggressive exploration behavior while ensuring the robot's safety. Our system includes a plug-and-play semantic target mapping module that integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms for pointcloud-level dense semantic target mapping. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both realistic simulations and complex real-world environments. Simulation results show that our planner achieves faster exploration and shorter travel distances while guaranteeing a specified number of multi-view inspections. Real-world experiments further confirm the system's effectiveness in achieving accurate dense semantic object mapping of unstructured environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |
| **[Quantum deep reinforcement learning for humanoid robot navigation task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11388v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical reinforcement learning (RL) methods often struggle in complex, high-dimensional environments because of their extensive parameter requirements and challenges posed by stochastic, non-deterministic settings. This study introduces quantum deep reinforcement learning (QDRL) to train humanoid agents efficiently. While previous quantum RL models focused on smaller environments, such as wheeled robots and robotic arms, our work pioneers the application of QDRL to humanoid robotics, specifically in environments with substantial observation and action spaces, such as MuJoCo's Humanoid-v4 and Walker2d-v4. Using parameterized quantum circuits, we explored a hybrid quantum-classical setup to directly navigate high-dimensional state spaces, bypassing traditional mapping and planning. By integrating quantum computing with deep RL, we aim to develop models that can efficiently learn complex navigation tasks in humanoid robots. We evaluated the performance of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) in classical RL against its quantum implementation. The results show that the quantum SAC achieves an 8% higher average return (246.40) than the classical SAC (228.36) after 92% fewer steps, highlighting the accelerated learning potential of quantum computing in RL tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, zero-shot methods often fail under viewpoint-induced ambiguities and fixed-camera setups struggle when objects move or become self-occluded. To address these challenges, we propose an active pose estimation pipeline that combines a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with "robotic imagination" to dynamically detect and resolve ambiguities in real time. In an offline stage, we render a dense set of views of the CAD model, compute the FoundationPose entropy for each view, and construct a geometric-aware prompt that includes low-entropy (unambiguous) and high-entropy (ambiguous) examples. At runtime, the system: (1) queries the VLM on the live image for an ambiguity score; (2) if ambiguity is detected, imagines a discrete set of candidate camera poses by rendering virtual views, scores each based on a weighted combination of VLM ambiguity probability and FoundationPose entropy, and then moves the camera to the Next-Best-View (NBV) to obtain a disambiguated pose estimation. Furthermore, since moving objects may leave the camera's field of view, we introduce an active pose tracking module: a diffusion-policy trained via imitation learning, which generates camera trajectories that preserve object visibility and minimize pose ambiguity. Experiments in simulation and real-world show that our approach significantly outperforms classical baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>6D Po...</summary><p>6D Pose, Diffusion Policy</p></details> |

However, continually learning new tasks would introduce catastrophic forgetting problems due to data distribution shifts. To mitigate this, we store a subset of data from previous tasks and utilize it in two manners: leveraging experience replay to retain learned skills and applying a novel Retrieval-based Local Adaptation technique to restore relevant knowledge. Since a lifelong learning robot must operate in task-free scenarios, where task IDs and even boundaries are not available, our method performs effectively without relying on such information. We also incorporate a selective weighting mechanism to focus on the most "forgotten" skill segment, ensuring effective knowledge restoration. Experimental results across diverse manipulation tasks demonstrate that our framework provides a scalable paradigm for lifelong learning, enhancing robot performance in open-ended, task-free scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Brain-Robot Interface for Exercise Mimicry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11306v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For social robots to maintain long-term engagement as exercise instructors, rapport-building is essential. Motor mimicry--imitating one's physical actions--during social interaction has long been recognized as a powerful tool for fostering rapport, and it is widely used in rehabilitation exercises where patients mirror a physiotherapist or video demonstration. We developed a novel Brain-Robot Interface (BRI) that allows a social robot instructor to mimic a patient's exercise movements in real-time, using mental commands derived from the patient's intention. The system was evaluated in an exploratory study with 14 participants (3 physiotherapists and 11 hemiparetic patients recovering from stroke or other injuries). We found our system successfully demonstrated exercise mimicry in 12 sessions; however, accuracy varied. Participants had positive perceptions of the robot instructor, with high trust and acceptance levels, which were not affected by the introduction of BRI technology.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge is the scarcity of patient behavior data for developing robust policies. To address this, we engaged 33 expert healthcare practitioners as patient proxies, using their interactions with our robot to inform a patient behavior model capable of generating exercise performance metrics and subjective scores on perceived exertion. We trained a reinforcement learning-based policy in simulation, demonstrating that it can adapt exercise instructions to individual exertion tolerances and fluctuating performance, while also being applicable to patients at different recovery stages with varying exercise plans.</p></details> |  |
| **[MEMBOT: Memory-Based Robot in Intermittent POMDP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11225v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic systems deployed in real-world environments often operate under conditions of partial and often intermittent observability, where sensor inputs may be noisy, occluded, or entirely unavailable due to failures or environmental constraints. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that assume full state observability are ill-equipped for such challenges. In this work, we introduce MEMBOT, a modular memory-based architecture designed to address intermittent partial observability in robotic control tasks. MEMBOT decouples belief inference from policy learning through a two-phase training process: an offline multi-task learning pretraining stage that learns a robust task-agnostic latent belief encoder using a reconstruction losses, followed by fine-tuning of task-specific policies using behavior cloning. The belief encoder, implemented as a state-space model (SSM) and a LSTM, integrates temporal sequences of observations and actions to infer latent state representations that persist even when observations are dropped. We train and evaluate MEMBOT on 10 robotic manipulation benchmark tasks from MetaWorld and Robomimic under varying rates of observation dropout. Results show that MEMBOT consistently outperforms both memoryless and naively recurrent baselines, maintaining up to 80% of peak performance under 50% observation availability. These findings highlight the effectiveness of explicit belief modeling in achieving robust, transferable, and data-efficient policies for real-world partially observable robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAMP: Spatial Anchor-based Motion Policy for Collision-Aware Robotic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11185v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural-based motion planning methods have achieved remarkable progress for robotic manipulators, yet a fundamental challenge lies in simultaneously accounting for both the robot's physical shape and the surrounding environment when generating safe and feasible motions. Moreover, existing approaches often rely on simplified robot models or focus primarily on obstacle representation, which can lead to incomplete collision detection and degraded performance in cluttered scenes. To address these limitations, we propose spatial anchor-based motion policy (SAMP), a unified framework that simultaneously encodes the environment and the manipulator using signed distance field (SDF) anchored on a shared spatial grid. SAMP incorporates a dedicated robot SDF network that captures the manipulator's precise geometry, enabling collision-aware reasoning beyond coarse link approximations. These representations are fused on spatial anchors and used to train a neural motion policy that generates smooth, collision-free trajectories in the proposed efficient feature alignment strategy. Experiments conducted in both simulated and real-world environments consistently show that SAMP outperforms existing methods, delivering an 11% increase in success rate and a 7% reduction in collision rate. These results highlight the benefits of jointly modelling robot and environment geometry, demonstrating its practical value in challenging real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic Design), a framework that enables the automated design of parallel robotic mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware, potentially transforming the development of embodied AI systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

Compared to typical car-like robots, the addition of trailers provides greater transportation capability. However, this also complicates motion planning due to the robot's complex kinematics, high-dimensional state space, and deformable structure. To efficiently plan safe, time-optimal trajectories that adhere to the kinematic constraints of the robot and address the challenges posed by its unique features, this paper introduces a lightweight, compact, and high-order smooth trajectory representation for tractor-trailer robots. Based on it, we design an efficiently solvable spatial-temporal trajectory optimization problem. To deal with deformable structures, which leads to difficulties in collision avoidance, we fully leverage the collisionfree regions of the environment, directly applying deformations to trajectories in continuous space. This approach not requires constructing safe regions from the environment using convex approximations through collision-free seed points before each optimization, avoiding the loss of the solution space, thus reducing the dependency of the optimization on initial values. Moreover, a multi-terminal fast path search algorithm is proposed to generate the initial values for optimization. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves severalfold improvements in efficiency compared to existing algorithms, while also ensuring lower curvature and trajectory duration. Real-world experiments involving the transportation, loading and unloading of goods in both indoor and outdoor scenarios further validate the effectiveness of our method.

A policy trained from a fixed front-facing camera may fail when the camera is shifted--an unavoidable situation in real-world settings where sensor placement is hard to manage appropriately. Existing methods often rely on precise camera calibration or struggle with large perspective changes. To address these limitations, we propose ManiVID-3D, a novel 3D RL architecture designed for robotic manipulation, which learns view-invariant representations through self-supervised disentangled feature learning. The framework incorporates ViewNet, a lightweight yet effective module that automatically aligns point cloud observations from arbitrary viewpoints into a unified spatial coordinate system without the need for extrinsic calibration. Additionally, we develop an efficient GPU-accelerated batch rendering module capable of processing over 5000 frames per second, enabling large-scale training for 3D visual RL at unprecedented speeds. Extensive evaluation across 10 simulated and 5 real-world tasks demonstrates that our approach achieves a 44.7% higher success rate than state-of-the-art methods under viewpoint variations while using 80% fewer parameters. The system's robustness to severe perspective changes and strong sim-to-real performance highlight the effectiveness of learning geometrically consistent representations for scalable robotic manipulation in unstructured environments.

Connected and automated factories face growing cybersecurity risks that can potentially cause interruptions and damages to physical operations. Among these attacks, data-integrity attacks often involve sophisticated exploitation of vulnerabilities that enable an attacker to access and manipulate the operational data and are hence difficult to detect with only existing intrusion detection or model-based detection. This paper addresses the challenges in utilizing existing side-channels to detect data-integrity attacks in robotic manufacturing processes by developing an online detection framework, ViSTR-GP, that cross-checks encoder-reported measurements against a vision-based estimate from an overhead camera outside the controller's authority. In this framework, a one-time interactive segmentation initializes SAM-Track to generate per-frame masks. A low-rank tensor-regression surrogate maps each mask to measurements, while a matrix-variate Gaussian process models nominal residuals, capturing temporal structure and cross-joint correlations. A frame-wise test statistic derived from the predictive distribution provides an online detector with interpretable thresholds. We validate the framework on a real-world robotic testbed with synchronized video frame and encoder data, collecting multiple nominal cycles and constructing replay attack scenarios with graded end-effector deviations. Results on the testbed indicate that the proposed framework recovers joint angles accurately and detects data-integrity attacks earlier with more frequent alarms than all baselines. These improvements are most evident in the most subtle attacks. These results show that plants can detect data-integrity attacks by adding an independent physical channel, bypassing the controller's authority, without needing complex instrumentation.</p></details> |  |

One key challenge in machine learning for assistive and rehabilitative robotics with disabled-bodied subjects is the difficulty of collecting labeled training data.

We investigate the use of meta-learning to mitigate the burden of data collection needed to adapt high-capacity neural networks to a new session or subject. Our experiments on real clinical data collected from five stroke subjects show that MetaEMG can improve the intent inferral accuracy with a small session- or subject-specific dataset and very few fine-tuning epochs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formulate intent inferral on stroke subjects as a meta-learning problem and demonstrate fast adaptation to a new session or subject for controlling a robotic hand orthosis with EMG signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IROS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Design of scalable orthogonal digital encoding architecture for large-area flexible tactile sensing in robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10888v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-like embodied tactile perception is crucial for the next-generation intelligent robotics. Achieving large-area, full-body soft coverage with high sensitivity and rapid response, akin to human skin, remains a formidable challenge due to critical bottlenecks in encoding efficiency and wiring complexity in existing flexible tactile sensors, thus significantly hinder the scalability and real-time performance required for human skin-level tactile perception. Herein, we present a new architecture employing code division multiple access-inspired orthogonal digital encoding to overcome these challenges. Our decentralized encoding strategy transforms conventional serial signal transmission by enabling parallel superposition of energy-orthogonal base codes from distributed sensing nodes, drastically reducing wiring requirements and increasing data throughput. We implemented and validated this strategy with off-the-shelf 16-node sensing array to reconstruct the pressure distribution, achieving a temporal resolution of 12.8 ms using only a single transmission wire. Crucially, the architecture can maintain sub-20ms latency across orders-of-magnitude variations in node number (to thousands of nodes). By fundamentally redefining signal encoding paradigms in soft electronics, this work opens new frontiers in developing scalable embodied intelligent systems with human-like sensory capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 9 figures(Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2025)</p></details> |

Unlike traditional single-robot and multi-agent systems, MRS poses unique challenges, including coordination, scalability, and real-world adaptability. This survey provides the first comprehensive exploration of LLM integration into MRS. It systematically categorizes their applications across high-level task allocation, mid-level motion planning, low-level action generation, and human intervention. We highlight key applications in diverse domains, such as household robotics, construction, formation control, target tracking, and robot games, showcasing the versatility and transformative potential of LLMs in MRS. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that limit adapting LLMs in MRS, including mathematical reasoning limitations, hallucination, latency issues, and the need for robust benchmarking systems. Finally, we outline opportunities for future research, emphasizing advancements in fine-tuning, reasoning techniques, and task-specific models. This survey aims to guide researchers in the intelligence and real-world deployment of MRS powered by LLMs. Based on the fast-evolving nature of research in the field, we keep updating the papers in the open-source GitHub repository.</p></details> |  |

However, because wires are flexible materials, they tend to introduce large modeling errors, and their adoption in industrial and research robots remains limited.In this study, we built a Universal Wire Testing Machine that enables measurement and adjustment of wire characteristics to improve the performance of wire-driven mechanisms. Using this testing machine, we carried out removal of initial wire stretch, measurement of tension transmission efficiency for eight different diameters of passive pulleys, and measurement of the dynamic behavior of variable-length wires. Finally, we applied the data obtained from this testing machine to the force control of an actual wire-driven robot, reducing the end-effector force error.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Humanoids2025, website - https://tenrobo18.github.io/wiretester-humanoids2025-webpage/</p></details> |

To be effective, such robots must follow the target while ensuring safety and comfort for both the target and surrounding people. In this work, we present the first end-to-end study of RPF, which (i) surveys representative scenarios, motion-planning methods, and evaluation metrics with a focus on safety and comfort; (ii) introduces Follow-Bench, a unified benchmark simulating diverse scenarios, including various target trajectory patterns, dynamic-crowd flows, and environmental layouts; and (iii) re-implements six popular RPF planners, ensuring that both safety and comfort are systematically considered. Moreover, we evaluate the two highest-performing planners from our benchmark on a differential-drive robot to provide insights into real-world deployment. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments provide quantitative insights into the safety-comfort trade-offs of existing planners, while revealing open challenges and future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>TBD. ...</summary><p>TBD.

| **[Analytical Design and Development of a Modular and Intuitive Framework for Robotizing and Enhancing the Existing Endoscopic Procedures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10735v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the widespread adoption of endoscopic devices for several cancer screening procedures, manual control of these devices still remains challenging for clinicians, leading to several critical issues such as increased workload, fatigue, and distractions. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce the design and development of an intuitive, modular, and easily installable mechatronic framework. This framework includes (i) a novel nested collet-chuck gripping mechanism that can readily be integrated and assembled with the existing endoscopic devices and control their bending degrees-of-freedom (DoFs); (ii) a feeder mechanism that can control the insertion/retraction DoF of a colonoscope, and (iii) a complementary and intuitive user interface that enables simultaneous control of all DoFs during the procedure. To analyze the design of the proposed mechanisms, we also introduce a mathematical modeling approach and a design space for optimal selection of the parameters involved in the design of gripping and feeder mechanisms. Our simulation and experimental studies thoroughly demonstrate the performance of the proposed mathematical modeling and robotic framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous Gathering of Opaque Robots with Mobility Faults](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10711v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the fundamental benchmarking problem of gathering in an $(N,f)$-fault system consisting of $N$ robots, of which at most $f$ might fail at any execution, under asynchrony. Two seminal results established impossibility of a solution in the oblivious robot (OBLOT) model in a $(2,0)$-fault system under semi-synchrony and in a $(3,1)$-Byzantine fault system under asynchrony. Recently, a breakthrough result circumvented the first impossibility result by giving a deterministic algorithm in a $(2,0)$-fault system under asynchrony in the luminous robot (LUMI) model using 2-colored lights. However, a breakthrough result established impossibility of gathering in a $(2,1)$-crash system in the LUMI model under semi-synchrony. In this paper, we consider a {\em mobility fault} model in which a robot crash only impacts it mobility but not the operation of the light. We establish four results under asynchrony in LUMI with the mobility fault model. We show that it is impossible to solve gathering in a $(2,1)$-mobility fault system using 2-colored lights, and then give a solution using 3-colored lights, which is optimal w.r.t. the number of colors. We then consider an $(N,f)$-mobility fault system, $f<N$, both $N,f$ not known, and give two deterministic algorithms that exhibit a nice time-color trade-off: The first with time $O(N)$ using 7-colored lights and the second with time $O(\max\{\ell,f\})$ using 26-colored lights, where $\ell< N$ is the number of distinct convex layers of robot positions in the initial configuration. Interestingly, for $l, f = O(1)$, our result is optimal. Our algorithms for an $(N,f)$-mobility fault system are the first to be analysed time complexity, can withstand obstructed visibility (opaque robot model) and asynchronous scheduling.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 26 figures, and 1 table</p></details> |
| **[STL-Based Motion Planning and Uncertainty-Aware Risk Analysis for Human-Robot Collaboration with a Multi-Rotor Aerial Vehicle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10692v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach to motion planning and risk analysis for enhancing human-robot collaboration using a Multi-Rotor Aerial Vehicle (MRAV). The proposed method uses Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to encode key mission objectives, such as safety, timing, and human preferences, with a strong focus on ergonomics and comfort. An optimization framework generates dynamically feasible trajectories while considering the MRAV's physical constraints. Given the nonlinear and non-convex nature of the problem, smooth approximations and gradient-based techniques assist in handling the problem's computational complexity. Additionally, an uncertainty-aware risk analysis is incorporated to assess potential deviations from the mission specifications, providing insights into the likelihood of mission success under uncertain conditions. Further, an event-triggered replanning strategy is implemented to respond to unforeseen events and external disturbances. The approach is validated through MATLAB and Gazebo simulations, using an object handover task in a mock-up environment inspired by power line maintenance scenarios. The results highlight the method's effectiveness in achieving safe, efficient, and resilient human-robot collaboration.</p></details> | 39 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Coordinated Motion Planning of a Wearable Multi-Limb System for Enhanced Human-Robot Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10444v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRLs) can enhance human capability within close proximity. However, as a wearable device, the generated moment from its operation acts on the human body as an external torque. When the moments increase, more muscle units are activated for balancing, and it can result in reduced muscular null space. Therefore, this paper suggests a concept of a motion planning layer that reduces the generated moment for enhanced Human-Robot Interaction. It modifies given trajectories with desirable angular acceleration and position deviation limits. Its performance to reduce the moment is demonstrated through the simulation, which uses simplified human and robotic system models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in IROS 2023 Workshop (Multilimb Coordination in Human Neuroscience and Robotics: Classical and Learning Perspectives)</p></details> |
| **[Repeatable Energy-Efficient Perching for Flapping-Wing Robots Using Soft Grippers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11921v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of new flapping-wing micro aerial vehicle (FWMAV) designs, a need for extensive and advanced mission capabilities arises. FWMAVs try to adapt and emulate the flight features of birds and flying insects. While current designs already achieve high manoeuvrability, they still almost entirely lack perching and take-off abilities. These capabilities could, for instance, enable long-term monitoring and surveillance missions, and operations in cluttered environments or in proximity to humans and animals. We present the development and testing of a framework that enables repeatable perching and take-off for small to medium-sized FWMAVs, utilising soft, non-damaging grippers. Thanks to its novel active-passive actuation system, an energy-conserving state can be achieved and indefinitely maintained while the vehicle is perched. A prototype of the proposed system weighing under 39 g was manufactured and extensively tested on a 110 g flapping-wing robot. Successful free-flight tests demonstrated the full mission cycle of landing, perching and subsequent take-off. The telemetry data recorded during the flights yields extensive insight into the system's behaviour and is a valuable step towards full automation and optimisation of the entire take-off and landing cycle.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 16 figures, 5 multimedia extensions</p></details> |
